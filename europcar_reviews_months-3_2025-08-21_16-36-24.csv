Efficient, polite and helpful all through the pick up process he's a credit to the company. The car was clean, in great condition and drop off was super efficient a couple of days later. Very good experience. Thank you!"
Food Journeyz,2025-08-19,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/68a4b0311a73c9faacbdfdfc,"Europcar took 3 payments out of wife's bank account twice for identical sums of money. She is still waiting for a refund and being fed a load of lies from Europcar even with them having accepted liability for the error and told her that the money was released 2 weeks ago. Its now a month since it happened. On top of this, the car has been returned and their pre authorisations have not been released and the deposit has not been returned.
Their continued moving of timelines and this behavior has to be illegal as I do not understand how they can simply take money out of a bank account when the customer has not authorised it. Tesco can't do that with shopping."

I reserved a ""T-Roc or similar"" and tried to pre-empt me not getting ""or similar"" by contacting Europcar (Madrid) in advance. They responded with a ""we cannot promise anything"" and indeed when I arrived was given a Hyundai Tucson covered in scratches with a flogged engine 65k on the clock. Europcar then pre-authorised 800 Euros on my credit card in case of collision even though I had paid an extra 70 pounds to booking.com for full additional insurance (excess insurance). I hated the Hyundai Tucson. The safety features were infuriating with the parking brake auto-hold not having a light on the console and the locked patrol cap. The staff were very polite at Europcar Valencia airport but the experience was a let-down. One week after returning the car I noticed a further charge from Europcar on my credit card. When I contacted them they said it was an ""environmental contribution"" charged to me in error when it should have been charged to the intermediary (i.e. booking.com). Long story short I would avoid using either Europcar or booking.com for a car rental in the future."

I rented a car for a month in June 2025. The collection was smooth although, while the car had been washed, it had not been wiped dry and so was covered with water marks. I inspected the car reasonably thoroughly and could not see any damage.

On returning the car the member of staff immediately identified what she claimed was damage but to my mind was a mark on the rear bumper that was hardly visible and not possible to see without wiping away the water marks. Nevertheless, the staff member required me to sign the Statement of Return acknowledging the damage. She told me that is it was the only way I would get my deposit back and also implied that the damage would be assessed by an expert and would probably not be an issue. As I was in a hurry to catch my flight I signed document."

Booked a Citroen C3 fuel car for 12 days in Tolouse in late July. (almost £300 total) . I used the GOTrentalcars website to book the car from Europcar.

My Ryanair flight was late so I got to the Europcar at 12.30am. They did not have the Citroen C3. They insisted I had booked an electric car of the lowest category. ( Major Red Flag) I insisted I hadn't because I deliberately excluded electric cars when booking. The electric car they wanted to give me could only drive for 1 hour before needing charging. I would never have willingly booked this.

They only had 1 fuel car to offer me but it was going to cost an extra £60 PER DAY!!! I was absolutely stuck, I had a young child with me and it was 1am on a saturday night, I had to drive for 1.5 hours to get to our accomodation. I was forced to get the fuel car at £60 extra per day but they said I could try and explain the next day and change it. All day Sunday and Monday was ruined because I was trying to sort out the situation on the phone and eventually just had to go back to return the car and try to get refunded for the 10 days. But they still have not refunded me. ( RED FLAG - staff directly lied to me)
However the Europcar staff at Toulouse airport were completely UNHELPFUL and RUDE. RED FLAG. I had an argument with them in the Toulouse airport. I parked the car near their returns office and went away for an hour.

When I came back to return the car, they said there was a dimple on the rear door. RED FLAG! I KNOW that I hadn't ever touched this door or seen the dimple when I checked the car over. I think they did it out of malice for my complaining. I asked to check cctv but there wasnt any. They forced me to sign a thing saying I had created the dimple. I definitely did not. It is so small that I took a close-up photo and you still can't see it. They have taken £800 out of my bank account. They have not even refunded me 10 days' worth of £ that I had paid.

Every staff member that I spoke to from GOTrental cars and Europcar says I signed the contract in the first place for the car. I keep saying I was FORCED to sign it because I was stuck in the middle of the night with a child and they did not have the car I had booked. I am being totally GASLIT by these theiving, tricking, fraudulent blatant liars, and they now owe me £1200 plus 2 days of my holiday plus petrol and toll money to return the wrong car.

THEY WILL NOT GET AWAY WITH THIS."
Fraser Barclay,2025-08-18,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/68a35bae487be95dfdd67e64,"After using this company for car rentals quite often over a few years, I thought I'd grown to trust them as one of the better car rental companies that weren't out to scam you at every possible opportunity.

Unfortunately, I was proven wrong when I was handed a cleaning fee for having some dirt, from a shoe, in the footwell of the car. This was deemed excessive and upon querying the matter, I was told this would require 'expert third party cleaners ' and 'the cleaning of a interior specialist'.

Direct quotes, yet evidence of this was never produced and I was ignored for over a month before receiving a dismissive email saying they will not be replying any more.

If only photos were allowed on this platform to show how little dirt was apparently deemed to be excessive. I have since moved to using other car rental companies, as this lack of customer service for a long-standing customer, or anyone, is just not good enough.

I will be reporting them to the British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association for breaching their code of conduct in their handling of this matter."
Chris,2025-08-19,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/68a3540890ee2d6cbf4d522a,"I booked a hire car and paid for it using my Monzo card, got a train to Gatwick Airport and brough this card with me like the booking confirmation said to. I hired another vehicle with Europcar earlier this year and had no problems paying the deposit using this card.

Got to the branch to be told by staff that they don't accept Monzo so I couldn't hire the car. Nobody could explain why this was their policy, only that they had to cancel the booking.

I offered to make a full payment for the deposit amount which could be refunded when I returned the car, but the staff weren't having it either. I spoke to the branch manager, who could only tell me that they didn't accept Monzo and I'd have to cancel my booking.

This policy seems to be based on the understanding that Monzo cards aren't ""real debit cards"", which doesn't seem to be true.

In the end, I had to ask my friend to travel to the branch with another card, and Europcar refuse to cover the costs of this even though (1) they literally told me to bring the card I used to pay for the booking and (2) their terms say they accept debit cards.

Europcar's customer service have just ignored my attempts to get them to refund me for these costs, or to at least explain their policy. Useless.

If anyone from Europcar reads this, my case number is 23955880."
Ian Longstaff,2025-08-18,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/68a34959c55d19db1b8243ce,"I’m very disappointed with this group
I got a lawyers letter through this morning which I have been asked to pay for damage to the car I hired from the 29/05/2025 to the 02/06/2025.i never got anything back from them regarding this and as far I knew everything was ok.
I since tried to call the lawyers and was on the phone for 1.5 hours to get someone. I gave up on that and called the head office of Europcar to discuss the matter. The woman name was lynne who insisted that they had sent a email for recovery of damage. I then checked my junk mail and found 2 emails from Europcar. One was the invoice from them on the 04/06/2025 saying the car was ok and the deposit would be returned
Which it was by Europcar.

Then on the the 23/06/2025 I have another email regarding the damage to the car ( which was a flat tyre and I picture of the tyre with the nail in it.
3 weeks after the so called nail was in the tyre they contact me to inform me that I must of done it and they were going to charge me for the time it was off the road a new tyre and admin fees of 251.64. Something I did not know about til now.
I know I checked the car out and it did not have a puncture as I checked all aspects at of it with a friend who assisted me in the process. At no point was the car damaged or anything wrong with it.
How can this company say the car was ok and issue an invoice on the 4th June 2025 and then 3 weeks later decide that the car had a puncture and decide to send me a bill.
They must of done this when driving the car round the car park or someone else who hired it and the only person they could blame was the last person who drove it. This is wrong on all levels and I will contest it as it looks like they are blaming anyone they can. Absolute disgrace from Europcar and as a company I used to use regularly I won’t be using again and I will tell anyone who is using this company do not use them as they are not true to there words of being a good company who cares about the drivers."

If I could rate this company 0 stars, I would. Europcar is a scam company that happily takes money from customers but doesn’t provide the car you booked. They confirmed my reservation and took my payment without doing the necessary checks. I travelled all the way to London City Airport, only to be told I couldn’t collect the car.

This company wastes people’s time and money, and it feels like they take bookings just to hold customers’ money for their own interest. Disgraceful service, no accountability, and a complete scam. Avoid Europcar at all costs."

I picked up my car in Johannesburg and they tried to give me a car without a damage report, telling me “it will be fine”.

Upon checking the car it had clearly been in some form of accident. It took an hour of refusing to take the car without damage report for them to finally say they would bring me a new car at my address later, but that I should take this one for now (I assume they then would have said the car was damaged by in the time between me taking it and them brining the new one).

Travelling with a newborn, this was stressful and they eventually brought me a new car with a damage report and assured me that I had the maximum insurance. Unfortunately this was not the case as I was hit by a driver running a red light and Europcar took £2000 from me.

Be careful, these guys are extremely shady."

If you are disabled and rely on Motability, avoid Europa Car Belfast at all costs. Unfortunately, they have the contract with Motability for hire cars if your vehicle breaks down – but that “service” is virtually non-existent.

They rarely answer the phone, and when they finally do, they lie. I was told a car would be ready for me in 2 days. That never happened. A week later, I still have no car, no update, and no way of knowing when (or if) I’ll get one.

I am disabled and live in a remote area with no access to shops or medical appointments without a vehicle. This delay has left me completely stranded and put my health at risk. The lack of care or urgency for a disabled customer’s needs is absolutely shocking.

Europa Car Belfast have shown themselves to be unreliable, dishonest, and completely unsympathetic to the needs of vulnerable people. If you have any other option, take it – because you cannot count on them."

So I had to trust them, and when I got home they invoiced me for recharging the car and took the payment from my credit card.

Duped Norris,2025-08-13,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/689c35cb5c8c0d8ef6fa8b12,"I had a prepaid car rental voucher for a predetermined type vehicle through a third-party provider. I went to collect the vehicle from EuropCar Gatwick South Terminal to be told by the female EuroCar employee that the vehicle we ordered was not available. She said “We are giving you a free upgrade”. No mention of cost we would pay etc. because we were told they were GIVING us an upgrade. GIVING! It is my understanding that under law, if the company cannot provide the car ordered (and paid for) they must offer either a free upgrade or a lesser vehicle with a monetary refund, The upgrade was a very luxurious vehicle and I was immediately resistant and anxious and expressed deep concern to her, I was told by the female agent not to worry, the vehicle was at the end of its rental life, it had 50,000 miles on the odometer, which it did, and it was to be disposed of when I returned it. Reluctantly I accepted it. I felt it had been foisted upon me. When I was outside loading the car, the female agent came out and said the car had damaged wheels and I had to sign a form to acknowledge the damage. She presented form with a diagram of the car, both sides, with X marks on the wheels. I now realise she had folded the paper in half so that I couldn’t see what was on the other side. I really thought the shonky, trickster days of car hire had long gone. Boy was I wrong!!!
In hindsight I should have said NO! NO! NO and I should have run away, screaming, and rung the third-party provider and complained, but I didn’t, fool that I am. However, after 26 hours of travel I was exhausted, and yes, I now know I was dimwitted not to spot a scam in the making.
I hated the car from the start. This car wrecked my entire holiday and nearly wrecked me. I was highly anxious when I drove it and it made me quite ill from worry, It was too large and too wide for UK parking spaces. It literally got stuck in the entry to a shopping centre car park. It gave my daughter high level anxiety attacks. I had to try to park it away from other cars because I was terrified they would dent the car’s doors. This car was just too big,and too wide for UK narrow roads, even some A roads were scary and it did things I found hard to accept. It was so technical it was dangerous, simply because it was distracting.
But just as importantly, mechanically it was difficult. When the car started off there were many times when it just didn’t want to change up gears. Leaving Cobham Services, the car wouldn’t change gears at all and I held my breath thinking I would need a tow truck, but eventually it did change up. I am used to driving a Subaru with CVT automatic, but this vehicle had a habit of just stopping and not moving off. It would stop and go into Neutral and once you realised why the car wasn’t moving and what had happened, you had to go through the set process to get it going again. This happened in dangerous places at times like waiting to enter a large roundabout on a 70mph road. A friend suggested I return the car and I jolly well wish I had.
On the day I had to return the car to Gatwick, a yellow message about the tyres appeared on the consol. 8 calls to EuropCar proved useless and so I drove just down the road to the local dealership for the marque. Service personnel said it was ok to drive it back and gave me instructions as to what to do with the gadget in the trunk should tyre pressure deteriorate. And this is how I returned the car.
During the term of the car hire I did check my credit card several times to see if EuropCar had levied the £1500 block for security and I was surprised they had not. I returned the car on 1 August and flew home. The day after I arrived home, I checked my credit card and found that at between the 29 July and 9 August (8 days after I had returned the car) EuropCar had charged me $3,630.06 in my money for the upgrade they told me they were GIVING me because they were unable to supply the car I had ordered and prepaid for. It was then that I remembered the woman who asked me to sign the document acknowledging the damage to the car, and it was then that I realised she had folded the document in half and therefore I could not see what was on the other side-the upgrade charges etc.What a Fool I am
I have lodged a dispute but EuropCarUK is notorious for completely ignoring disputes. I am told that what this woman did could be a criminal offence called Fraudulent Misrepresentation. Some could ask whether she is highly skilled in the dark arts of duplicity and deception? Of course I will not be letting this matter go and others in the travel and insurance industries have been advised. Eventually when I can confidently tell the Citizens Advice Bureau,Trading Standards,Watchdog and Rip-off Britain that EuropCar has done absolutely nothing to resolve my dispute,then I will lodge a dispute with the BVRLA to whom EuropCar belong."

Cameron Martin,2025-08-12,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/689b67b00fa58a25c203b1d7,"I booked a car for the month of August 25 and needed to make a small correction to the pickup location all other details remained the same - duration timings etc. I notified the customer care department almost immediately to explain the situation. I was subsequently notified that there was nothing they could do with 5 days notice before pickup and that I would either need to pick up the car as per the original booking or lose the rental money 840 pounds. I am on holiday, required the car for the duration of the holiday and was forced to rent another car whilst I contest the problem - simply ridiculous people.
I got no help from customer care, I raised a claim ( complaint) and was told the SLA for turnaround was up to 5 working days. Needless to say no reply to the complaint, it’s like pulling teeth with the zombies in customer care and now need to take them to an arbitration court.
Be very careful folk, this is a company that I have since found out are notorious for this type of thing and other abuses.

1️⃣ Hidden & Duplicate Charges
My booking clearly stated that Airport Surcharge and Vehicle Licence Fee were prepaid. But after returning the car, I was charged again for: Licenses and Fees &
Premium Station Surcharge

Europcar claimed these were “not charged again,” just shown again. Yet, £214.41 was deducted from my credit card — part of which they admit was £180.18 for Roadside Assistance, which I never intended to buy. That leaves £34.23 unexplained.

2️⃣ Misleading Upselling
Despite already having full insurance, I was pressured to buy Roadside Assistance at pickup. The staff explicitly told me it would not cost extra and was “included in the basic insurance.” This is clearly false and designed to exploit tourists unfamiliar with UK rental terms.

3️⃣ Admin Fees Without Proof
Charged £45 per “admin fee” for supposed fines or tolls — yet no evidence or notice was ever provided.

Rented a car for a week in Birmingham at EuroPcar

Had a full insurance over booking.com and when I arrived at the place to pick up the car, the staff just told me that their system can't accept the insurance that I bought over booking.com

The staff then forced me to buy one of their premium insurances before they would give me the keys to the car while then getting in contact with a person. They knew who to call at booking.com to force the cancelation of my insurance from there. My original price when I booked the car was around 60 pounds which then was changed to 250 + 100 in deposit.

The choice I had were 250 gbp + 100 gbp in deposit for full insurance
150 gbp + 200 gbp in deposit for half insurance
and the most outrages one was 87 gbp + 700 gbp in deposit for only windshield insurance

Had to talk with the support 3 times and on the second time I called in toto hear about the deposit. The lady on the phone just said I should wait and placed me on a waiting line just to end the call.
I tried it once more after half an hour and spoke with someone who tried to help me.

First, when we arrived to collect our rental, we were expecting the MG ZS SUV we had booked months earlier. Instead, the woman at the desk tried to hand us a much smaller car — one that wouldn’t have fit our luggage. When we pointed this out, she suddenly offered us a van instead. We had to insist multiple times that we had paid for an SUV and expected what we reserved.

After “checking with the fleet manager” (twice), she miraculously located the exact vehicle we had booked — which had apparently been “unavailable” moments earlier. When we reached the car park, we saw at least half a dozen other MG ZS SUVs in plain sight, and another couple who had also just been given a van instead of the car they were promised.

Then came the handling of a parking fine administration fee. I had already successfully disputed the fine and notified Europcar with evidence before they charged my card. Despite this, they still took the £45 fee and made me chase them down multiple times — even rejecting a screenshot of the cancellation and demanding a PDF version of the exact same message. This is not how you treat a customer — especially one who proactively followed the rules and provided the relevant information in good faith.

If this is how Europcar handles both reservations and basic customer service, I’d strongly recommend choosing a different company."

Was forced into paying for the damage waiver in France as the operative simply would not stop badgering, knew I was in a rush and refused to give me the keys until I purchased the upgrade.

They tell you not to bother inspecting the car because you won’t be charged. THIS IS NOT TRUE. Dropping the car off there was a scratch on the paintwork which looked historic. Whilst I accept I should’ve checked and said something, I relied on what I was told that I didn’t need to check. I highlighted that the scratch looked historic and the operative at the other end even agreed. He told me to simply sign the form saying we’d spoken about it and not to worry as I wouldn’t be charged anyway as I had signed the damage waiver.

Well, I wake up to a £100 “damage admin fee” - so I was charged. With my invoice I had a link to press to complain, this sent me to a form that I completed. The response to that form was “you’ve contacted the wrong Europcar, you need to contact Europcar France not Europcar UK”.

The buck-passing began there. I asked repeatedly why I wasn’t allowed to rely on the representations made that I wouldn’t be charged both before I signed the contract and after and was told the T&C’s applied (which was in direct contradiction to what I was told). The response was only “you signed the form acknowledging the damage”. If I had known about the charge (and gone against what 2 members of staff said too my face), I wouldn’t have signed it.

Beware. Beware. Beware. They will hoodwink you, pressurise you and after all of that, still charge you. Hidden fees are their speciality it seems.

Having used this outfit twice, it appears that their usual practice is not to carry out any kind of pre-hire walk around with the customer. On the second of the two occasions I hired a car here, this lack of a pre-hire check was used in an attempt to make me pay for pre-existing damage to the wheel and tyre. The person I handed the car back to spotted this very minor blemish so quickly that I can only assume that they knew it was there and needed someone to pin it on.

However, while Europcar doesn't do pre-hire checks, I do and I had photos to prove that the damage was there when I collected the car. The person I handed the car over to couldn't have been less interested in this despite this being an opportunity to wrap things up there and then. He was clearly desperate to pass this up the chain, claiming that he would get in trouble if he didn't.

The matter was passed to Europcar's damage team, who are slow, incompetent and impertinent. After almost a month of exchanges, Europcar have gracelessly and grudgingly conceded that they were wrong and I've been informed that I will not be charged for damage that someone else caused.

I certainly won't be using this shady outfit again. If you do, I'd strongly advise you to take a comprehensive and clear photographs of every aspect of the car, interior as well as exterior photographs. Time stamp them if possible.

The first thing Bryan told me and reassured me was dont worry we have enough cars for you today and showed me all the cars they had in the carpark. I felt a bit better because thats what I needed to hear. Once he found out that Im desperate for a car as I broken down and once he found out what do I do for work everything changed. So online it was showing they have availabity for an Audi A3 coming all together around £250 for 4 days (second driver included) I did not book it online as I was unsure if they accept debit or credit card. So I turned up to the branch, even then I needed my uncle to book as I am currently waiting for my debit card to come home so in this case he would pay , and I can transfer him the money and I can drive to work.
Let’s go back at the point when “Bryan” found out how desperate I was for a car. He only offered me a Fiat punto for first £389, (after I told my uncle to make way and come to the branch) then I asked him how come online it says I can get an audi for almost half the price he said no you cannot no you cannot without giving me an answer as I was confused. Fair enough he wanted me to pay double, my uncle asked a question so which other cars do you have and Bryan looked at him weird asking for translation as my uncle english is not perfect but he is a manager at a wholesale place I can assure he has a degree, who is Bryan to make joke of his english?. This completely made me think he was being racist to us. I then asked, ok so what if I book a car for 2 hours later as per online procedure and it was showing I can get an A3 for £250 for 4 days what would you do then if you saying you cannot give me that one as its gone? He did not bother giving me a proper answer and instead of helping me save money or finding a solution to my problem he decided to just say mate you can have the Fiat punto for £456 now or I’ll just tell you to walk out mate. What? So the price gone up for me asking few questions or my uncle asking a question?
THIS IS NOT HOW YOU TREAT A CUSTOMER IN NEED OF HELP, I DO NOT KNOW WHO GAVE TRAINING TO THIS GUY BUT PEOPLE AT DESKS ARE MEANT TO HELP CUSTOMER AND NOT CHARGE EXTRA EXTORTION PRICES. IM REALLY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS EXPERIENCE AS I WASTED ALMOST 3 HOURS OF MY TIME AND ALL I GOT IN RETURN WAS THIS GUY TRYING TO SHOW HIS POWER AND BE RACIST TO MY UNCLE PLUS STRESS TO FIND A CAR FOR MORNING. Really disappointed in you guys, because of Bryan I will have to catch a taxi early in the morning and back home. Meanwhile the other guy at the desk was the opposite, he went home at 7.30/8 pm but was willing to help his attitude was really nice I wish he stayed and dealt with my query. Also the guy bringing the cars was really kind too. Bryan Instead he could have decided to help me saying, mate book it for the morning or tomorrow online it might be cheaper or better cars etc….Is this how you treat customers in need of help? Charge extra amounts to show your powers? I have rented cars of you guys before and a lot of my friends and family have in the past hence I came. But after this experience with BRYAN do you think they would want to book again?"
Alessandro Belotti,2025-07-28,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/688724999809d29ad261cf77,"I booked a car online with everything confirmed and paid in advance. At the counter, I clearly declined extra services and only requested prepaid fuel.

Despite that, I was later charged for an additional insurance I never agreed to, followed by another unexpected charge after returning the car — with no explanation or invoice. On top of this, my deposit was never refunded!!!

I contacted customer service multiple times via email. To this day, no one has responded.

I booked my car through Expedia. However, upon collection at London Heathrow the price was considerably higher. When I questioned this I was told it would be resolved when the car returned and final invoice produced. A week later I have been billed the overcharged amount and neither Expedia nor Europcar willing to sort it out. In fact Europcar wrote to me saying they would not honor the Expedia pricing.

Miss Amy Magnus,2025-07-27,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/68860b5a042ae9e8350cac86,"If I could give 0 I would.
Our experience with this company was deeply frustrating and disappointing from start to finish. The customer service is absolutely appalling — no one was willing to take responsibility or even attempt to resolve the issues we faced. Every time we reached out for help, we were either ignored or passed around with no real support.

We were also given completely incorrect information about petrol prices, which led to us paying far more than necessary for the journey we took. When we raised this, it was brushed off without any accountability.

To make matters worse, there was a problem with the car itself — and again, no one wanted to assist. We were left to deal with the situation on our own, with no guidance, apology, or even basic courtesy.

I strongly advise others to avoid this company. Do not hire from them. The service is unprofessional, unreliable, and not worth the hassle or the cost."

David Chisam,2025-07-24,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/6881ab176f65d6a7cf273dd0,"Europcar Heathrow.
Arrived off a 32-hour flight from New Zealand. Tired and disorientated I arrived at the desk ready to produce my CarTrawler.com voucher for the 30-day rental. This was not required, apparently. I asked about an upgrade to a car with automatic transmission and was told that one was available at an additional 25 GBP per day. I was told by Danielle that because she was not (now) going to be charging me for the additional driver (upon the return of the vehicle) that additional cost would only ‘feel’ like 5 GBP per day as the additional driver would have otherwise been charged at 20 GBP per day. We signed the documents, drove away and then 30 minutes later realised we’d been well and truly conned by Danielle.

The cost of the additional driver, for the original vehicle or for the upgrade was NOT 20 GBP per day (or 600 GBP in total). It’s only 186 GBP for the whole period (according to their website) for the upgraded vehicle. I phoned Customer Services from a service station on the M5, who also said that the 186 was too cheap and it they’d never offer an additional driver for less that 13 GBP per day.

So, having already paid 1,034 GBP for the original vehicle I was stung for another 1,035 GBP for the upgrade. The payment was taken out of my bank account, and this prompted an email to their customer services. Several emails later, during which I was told that “You’ve signed the documents, so you had to pay”, and that “I (the customer service rep) was not there when you had the conversation with Danielle, so I can’t confirm or corroborate what was said and so can’t offer a refund for the difference” etc etc, it went on.

The upgrade vehicle, should I have booked that originally, would have cost me 1,390 +186 = 1,576. I was conned out of 492 GBP. I wasn’t asking for a refund for the whole amount, just this difference. I would have been happy to pay the correct price for the vehicle that I had.

The whole ‘show’ was a farce. “For this deal I need to get my manager to sign this off. It’s that good” (Danielle). The whole things was a well-practiced hustle.

This whole experience really played on my mind for the whole of my holiday in the UK. This experience and realisation of their wrongdoing was something I was unable to reconcile with.

Avoid, avoid, avoid. I hope my that by writing this I can help others to avoid a similar experience.

I booked and paid for an SUV just three hours before pickup, only to arrive and be offered an electric car I never requested. When I declined, I was rudely dismissed and then told the only option was a tiny Fiat 500 — completely unsuitable for a family.

Other customers were facing the same issue, including those who had booked weeks in advance. The staff were rude, unhelpful, and took a “tough luck” attitude with everyone. I was even told it was my fault for booking “too late” — despite their system accepting my payment and confirming availability.

The whole experience was chaotic, unprofessional, and completely ruined the start of our family holiday. I had to get a refund and find an alternative at the last minute. Easily the worst customer service I’ve ever experienced. Never again."

I knew it wasn't right, but I was bullied into paying it, as it was my ex partners card on the car and I did not need the hassle.
When I got home, I contacted the toll company, to find that there was an error and the fine had been quashed. I contacted Europcar and was told they would look into the refund.

Two weeks later, still no refund and no response to my formal complaint. They were quick enough to bully me into paying the fine, but not so quick to refund what they owe me.

Awful customer service, with absolutely no idea how to help me get a resolution, other than to say someone will be in touch within 5 days!

After several minutes of selling, the upgrade would have cost a ridiculous amount so we stuck with our original car. The real bug bear is that we verbally agreed to return the car with a full tank of petrol, which we refilled at Birchanger services next to Stansted. Expecting a refund of the fuel deposit we paid of £47.04 and after re fuelling at a further cost of £18.63 thus totalling £65.67. Did we receive the deposit back, No. We contacted Europcar who opened a case but sadly even though the vehicle showed we had refilled the car to the exact amount that was in the tank originally they would not refund the deposit.

Lanre Sonola,2025-07-23,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/6880afb5f9683feb4599bd87,"I rented a van from Europcar on the 13th of June and returned it the following day, the 14th. While I’ll admit their vehicles are quite lovely and modern, that’s about the only good thing I can say. The rest of the experience was a full-blown disaster.
I used the van to move boxes to my new house, driving a total of just 38 miles. However, when I went to refill the tank before returning it, I had to put in 14.61 litres of diesel. That’s laughably excessive. For context, I drive a diesel SUV 64 miles round-trip to work daily, and that uses only 4–5 litres. So how did 38 miles in a van burn through nearly triple that?
The answer is simple: the vehicle wasn’t filled up properly when I received it. The digital fuel gauge can be deceiving, giving the impression of a full tank even when it’s not. I mentioned this immediately upon return, only to be told that maybe the heavy boxes I moved caused it. A flimsy excuse at best.
I raised a formal complaint online on June 15th, expecting the promised ""7 working day"" resolution. It's now well past that, and I’ve received nothing but silence and disgraceful customer service. I've been hung up on twice after providing my complaint reference, and on one occasion, I was subjected to the rudest, most unhelpful call imaginable. Not once did anyone seem remotely interested in resolving the issue.
If you're thinking of using Europcar, don’t unless you’re prepared to be ignored, insulted, and treated like a nuisance the moment you raise a concern. Their complaint process is more like a black hole. Once you're in, expect no return.
Avoid Europcar. Their shiny cars hide a rusty, soulless machine underneath."

We’re the expat family with 2 kids and grandparents either side of the country. We need a rental with a big boot.

Europcar website has an MG model they state takes 3 cases. The only other cars they state this are their premium models.

When you select the MG model online, when you come to pick it up you will likely be told it’s not available but they can upgrade you to a premium model. They will offer you standard model car that even by their own website can only take 2 cases. Forcing you into the premium models.

By this point you are stuck. An online booking of £850 cost me £2,000 in increased insurance coverage (yeeeah they waived the upgrade fee). They are only interested in upselling anything they can to you."

They told me that they wouldn’t stay open longer and if I don’t collect before they closed I would be a “no show” and I would lose my booking and all the pre paid money. I asked if i could collect the next morning, and was told no because they would have already cancelled the booking and put me down as now show. They suggested I call customer

To avoid the no show fee I had to cancel the booking online. WHY could I not just pick up the car a day later as I had already paid the full amount!! Side note noticed the hertz desk has stayed open late to meet the flight. After starting a customer complaint, Europcar informed me they re within their rights to not refund my deposit as I didn’t give 48 hours notice to cancel.

Car door was damaged upon pick up but strangely it wasnt already noted in the system when I returned the car. Got back home to Australia to find additional charge of 240 pounds on my card for additional products that I was supposedly offered at the desk. That is 100 per cent a lie. The assistant Ilias never offered me any extra products or services and I certainly never agreed to any. He must have ticked additional boxes on the paperwork without telling me. He kept me waiting for 10 minutes to serve me when there was no one else waiting. Waiting area was dirty . Have contacted the customer services team only to be told my request to a refund for their outright robbery has been refused. Would never ever hire a car from them again.

darren scott,2025-07-15,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/687607861b373fe6e1748790,"I hired a car from Europcar for 10 days at a cost of £380. Almost immediately after booking, I realised I needed the car for 12 days instead. I phoned their call centre and was told not to amend the booking — just to call back once I had the car, and they’d add the extra 2 days at £38 per day. Sounds simple, right? It wasn’t.

Two days into the hire, I called to extend the booking by 2 days — exactly as instructed — and was told I’d have to pay £420. That’s more than the original £380 for 10 days, just for 2 more days! Even more outrageous, I checked online and the same car was available for £170 over the same 2-day period.

When I asked why, I was told the only option was to return the vehicle all the way back to Edinburgh Airport (a 140-mile round trip for me), start a new booking, and drive off again — all for something I was told could be handled over the phone for an additional £80 total.

I raised this as a complaint and was told to contact the Edinburgh depot directly. After 5 separate attempts and 5 hours on hold over 2 days, I gave up — which I suspect is exactly what they count on.

I went back to the main number and asked to speak with customer service, only to be told:
“It’s what the computer says — there’s nothing we can do.”

Absolutely disgraceful service, zero accountability, and pricing that borders on predatory.

I booked a car through Ryanair for €150, thinking I was getting a fair deal. Once I arrived at the Europcar desk at Stansted, the nightmare began.

They tried every trick in the book to confuse me and inflate the price – hidden fees, invented extras, unclear explanations. It felt like I was being hustled in a market stall, not a professional rental company.

In the end, I ended up paying three times the original price just to add a second driver and get full coverage – things that should have been clear and reasonably priced from the beginning.

Max Garagnani,2025-07-19,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/6873b4b94f855136ce004913,"I hired a car from Trieste Ronchi Airport on 22 June 2025, and returned it in Bologna on Thur. 26 June.

The pick up process went OK, but the car's conditions were worse than those described on the contract. This forced me to take something like 18 pictures of various damages and return to the office to report one of them in particular. This was particularly unpleasant as I had to do this under the scorching sun at about 37 degrees; it would be greatly appreciated if Europcar could rent some parking slots in the shade.

But the worst was still to come. The documentation I had been emailed when I booked contained 2 different addresses where to return the car in Bologna. When I asked about this on the pick-up day, the person behind the desk (Sig.ra Ilenia) said that, actually, both of these addresses were wrong, and gave me a third address (""V. Matteotti, 5 - Bologna""). She mentioned that, when I reached the car park, I should go to level -1. That was it.

On the last day, car return time was 15:00. Google map said it would take me 15 minutes to drive to the alleged return address (Via Matteotti, 5); I left at 1:45pm (1h 15min early).
Indeed, after less than 20 mins, I reached ""via Matteotti""; however, when I started looking for no. 5, there was no “no. 5” anywhere. The numbering jumped from no. 1 to no. 7; in between, there was a huge bridge over the railway, and, after the bridge, Bologna's main Railway Station's car park.
The car park entrance had no indication suggesting that this might *also* be the place where rental cars had to be returned. There was NO Europcar sign to be seen anywhere, nor were there any other rental companies' signs, which would have hinted this could have been the correct location.

I stopped and called Europcar office in Bologna for some indications. It was about 2:10-15pm. Nobody answered. I tried several times, for about 5 minutes, but nobody picked up.

The clock was ticking. Given that I had 3 (three) different addresses where to return the car, and that, amongst those, one was Europcar's main offices', I decided to drive there, as the address placed it nearby.
After another 10 minutes, I managed to locate Europcar's office entrance, parked, and walked there.

It was 14:30, under a scorching sun (37 degrees C). When I got there, the office was closed. The sign on the door said ""14:30"" as the afternoon opening times. I waited for a few minutes, while occasionally ringing the bell, and insistently knocking on the office door.
No answer. Nobody was visible through the glass windows.
It was now past 14:35, the return time was approaching, and the door remained closed. I tried to call Europcar's office number again: no answer.
At that point I noticed a small sign (written in Italian) next to the office's door, stating that, should the office be closed, the car key should be dropped off at Europcar's car park located in the ** main train station's car park ***. It was now clear that Bologna's rail station car park was where Europcar also had its own car park.

But the calvary wasn't over. I drove the car to the train station car park, went to level -1 (where, finally, a ""Europcar"" sign showed up) and parked.
I had a look around, but there were no signs as to where to find the key drop box; there were no Europcar's desks anywhere. I walked to the top / ground floor, found a railways office, where a staff member of the national railways very kindly told me he believed the key box was on floor -1. He was not a Europcar staff, so he wasn't supposed to know this. I assume he knew as he had already come across tens of people who, like me, were looking for the same piece of information.
I then went back to level -1, where I found two other people equally lost and looking for the drop box: someone else had told them that it was at level -2, not -1. I decided to believe the railways staff member (for the reasons above) and we started walking around on level -1. Finally, in a very remote, dark corner of the car park, partly hidden by other cars, there it was, Europcar's key drop box.
It was now 2:55pm; I was drenched in sweat, and had spent 45' of my time doing this.

To sum up:
1. Europcar's office *never* answered any of my calls; I tried also later in the afternoon, repeatedly. This is simply a disgrace;
2. The documents I was sent contained 2 different addresses where to return the car, both incorrect;
3. Car conditions: some of the issues were not noted on the report I was given at car pick up;
4. When I picked up the car, Europcar staff (Sig.ra Ilenia) did not clarify that the return car park happen to coincide with Bologna's main train station car park;
5. Europcar's sign posting is abhorrent. A small sign next to the train station car park's entrance would have made this so much easier, as would some sign posting to the key drop box.

Overall, I will never hire a car with Europcar again."

I had a prepaid confirmed booking for pick up yesterday from London Stansted on 9th July and drop off to Gatwick airport on 28th July. I had prepaid 585.47 GBP in advance for this booking.
I was not given the car by Europcar and neither given a refund.

The worst part was that they couldn't contact their own internal department to correct the system because that department was closed for the long weekend.

I was left stranded and so had to go next door to Hertz and pay a large amount more for a 'walkup' rate hire (but was fortunate they had a car available.)
I have still not had my original pre-paid deposit refunded (but in fairness to Europcar, that would be by Carflexi - another issue).

A bit more explanation if needed - after hiring a car from Europcar the previous year, I received a notification from them that I had been issued an automated parking fine & associated Europcar admin fee (I don't have an issue with paying an admin fee for any legitimate infringement). However, I successfully challenged the parking ticket and Europcar confirmed they had rescinded the Admin Fee. Then I got a follow up letter from their Collecting-Agents / Solicitors chasing payment of the Admin Fee. Again, I sent the correspondence to them and again Europcar assured me this was rescinded and they had corrected it in their systems. They obviously couldn't be bothered to actually do that. When I arrived at Heathrow (after a long flight) they said they could not provide a car to me because I was on the 'watchlist' for this very same 'outstanding invoice'. I realized exactly what the issue was, but the department I needed to talk to was closed for the weekend. When they opened a few days later, they confirmed they were in error & I should not have been denied rental - but it was way too late by then.

The key was swiftly removed from us and we were handed keys to a Dacia Sandero. All I can say is that this car looked like it had been owned by a succession of learner drivers. There were scratches and dents everywhere and the car wasnt particularly clean inside. The tyres were barely legal and in a bad state for the dusty roads. Total deception on our side as we paid over £500 for this experience (and were parked next to the shiny new Peugeot we were meant to be picking up). Will not ever use this company again and will be watching the credit card carefully now following other reviews.
Lucy Hicks Arnold,2025-07-08,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/686cecce2fb596212e9bb8b2,"Do not use this company!!!! I booked and paid for a hire car in advance, travelling from Australia to London. Unfortunately, I got my flight times mixed up and was late collecting the car. I didn't think it'd be a problem, as I'd already paid for it. BUT if you are more than 1 hour late you forfeit your booking with no refund! (should have read all the small print) Being stuck with no car, kids and a three week holiday in front of me, I had to hire another car and pay a much higher additional cost—complete nightmare and very expensive. I'm NEVER using the company again."
Tom K,2025-07-08,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/686c5d562ca1f1c2d2735b6d,"I was told it's now IMPOSSIBLE to book a small car from Glasgow, unless you pay extra. I'm a Europcar regular - I'm looking at my online record and I see ten rentals in the last two and a bit years. These are private retals, spanning Portgal, France, Germany, Spain and the UK.
I booked a Compact car ('Cupra Leon or similar' - that's a small hatchback. As on my last trip to Scotland, I was instead given a dreadful, wallowy, absolutely huge MG SUV. I asked for a smaller car at the desk, and was told I could have a BMW 1 series - for an extra £30 a day. I was told it's not possible to get the car I asked for without going premium - instead I had to put up with a bloated, rubbishy Chinese SUV.
To make things worse, the car stank of cigarettes - some previous user had been smoking in it. I complained before I drove away, and it was recorded (so I wouldn't have to pay for the damage - probably impossible to clean effectively) but I wasn't offered a change of vehicle.
Still, at least there wasn't a queue. On two receent trips - to Toulouse in France in June, and to Portugal in April - I had to queue for more than an hour to collect the keys. There's no 'Privilege' desk any more for regular customers - no reward for customer loyalty, for filling out details in advance to speed things up. No, you queue with all the people who need every last comma on the contract explained to them, while staff try their hardest to up-sell. EVERY. STUPID. TIME.
Anyway I'm getting utterly fed up with Europcar, I noted that queues at some other rental places are much shorter. I don't know if Hertz or Avis have a functioning loyalty programme but I might give them a try.
I moved to the Europcar app after using brokers for years, after two unforunate experiences (with Greenmotion in Edinburgh, and Goldcar in Italy - the latter now ironically a Europcar brand) where I was ripped off for non-existent damage I didn't do. I have a global excess policy that I use everywhere from the US to Taiwan and Japan, as well as across Europe. But these two were the only times it's been triggered. To be fair, Europcar haven't ripped me off in this way. It's a credible brand. But customer service has not recovered from COVID and it seems it may well be time to move on."

So they charge me for 1 extra day, which is fair enough but what they didn’t tell at all until I confronted them about the extra 700 miles in charges! My booking was 6 days/ 1500 ml. This is 250 ml a day. Because I went over a few hours they change the mileage allowance to 90 per day which meant I was over 700 mos. Very deceiving. Never again I will hire from them. Also Bristol south not very nice people. In the end they charge me an extra 144£ for bringing the van a day later. Completely out of order!"

I rented with the company before and had no issues, all very smoothly. Also had rented another time and, with plenty of notice, had the reservation cancelled (which is fine), but having received several confirmation e-mails throughout the day to get there and having no explanation why I had no car waiting for me is less than human. I have lost my hotel reservation, deposit, and exhibition.
Worse is, I've gone around King's Cross to the other rental companies (including the same one, just a different branch), they all ran background checks, said it was all ok, but either had no cars or only £1k+/day cars.
There is no way of knowing whether you will get a car or not with Europcar, a company that is not very trustworthy.

At the desk the lady verbally said she could see I had insurance so all was good, I paid the deposit.
It wasn’t until I looked at the invoice at home and saw a charge for premium insurance which had been added on top of the full cover insurance I had already purchased online. The premium insurance added was for £274. I immediately phoned Europcar, they told me they couldn’t do anything til after the car had been returned. So I emailed them once I had returned the car and keys to the out of office box.
This was in February. I have formally complained 3? times now. And nothing. I left a review on Google and Europcar just sent me the link to complain, the same link I’ve used several times already with no response.

I booked a car online through Europcar at an average daily rate of £15. When I arrived at the Sheffield branch to collect the vehicle, I was told that the car I reserved was not available. Instead, they offered a Tesla and demanded an extra £30 per day for the upgrade during my 9-day rental.

When I declined, they offered another vehicle for an additional £12 per day. Again, I refused, and they then claimed that no other vehicles were available and that I would need to wait 3–4 hours for a car to be returned.

I had taken time off work and planned everything around this rental. After insisting firmly, they eventually gave me a car they had on-site — clearly proving that vehicles were available all along.

This company is clearly trying to upsell and exploit customers instead of honoring bookings. I had many options when booking, and I deeply regret choosing Europcar. They wasted over an hour of my time and caused unnecessary stress.

Michael Zevka,2025-06-24,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/685aa4eb1aa9c173e034c798,"We rented a car for our holiday in lake Garda .
And what a an unsafe shit show it was .
Firstly they tried to charge us more for our insurance cover and more for the child seat that we had all ready paid for.
Then the Q5 that we had originally thought we was getting was a beat up old Citroen which didn’t barely have room for our 2 suit cases and the boot flung open on the motorway where the bags were crammed in and they had the cheek to try and charge us more insurance on this car and more for the child seat !
Then when we got the car this is the whopper the child seat that we had booked and paid for for our 2 and half year old they brought out a car seat for a rear facing new born baby. When we alerted the staff they brought out a booster seat for a 4 year old plus and before we could raise concerns the man literally ran off and we had to leave the car park due to other cars trying to leave and blocking up the car park.Them they said you agreed to pay the extra insurance which was flung on us at a busy desk with a queue of people in a foreign country!
So for our holiday for 8 days we had to drive with our daughter in a seat belt which is completely illegal and unsafe and restate the work unsafe !
Due to this we didn’t drive 80 % of the holiday which we had planned to .
And still when I rang up customer service about all this when home they just brushed off the safety of our child as we have no evidence of the car seat and there is nothing we could do…. Surely they had the 2 car seats in there depot so surely that would be evidence enough.
The fact that we paid money to Europacar pre booked our child seat and car and they didn’t have the safety equipment of the car seat to keep our child safe is outrageous.
And then to be told we can not do anything about this is a sneaky and unsafe way to do business.
I would like to see if I rented a car and child seat for one of their children and rush them out of the car park and see how they would feel.
I would never use Europacar ever again unsafe unprofessional and sneaky aswell in the end .
Take your money and provide an unsafe service disgusting."

Toby,2025-06-24,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/685a7cc2d48dd527e3331a02,"This company has a history of being fraudulent but i thought it was reputable....until i used them.
Similar to so many reviews i was inundated and pressured on arrival to upgrade every aspect of my booking.
I didn't as i had selected my chosen option prior to booking as 99% of us do so why annoy us so much on arrival.
The car had damage but was functional for the purpose of our trip.
We returned the car and left the keys in the cabin as there was no staff so we assumed that was it.
I complained about an invoice for £100 which i thought had been charged for alleged damage. I complained and said that i didn't and couldn't have caused the damage.....and that the damage shown would cost £5 to polish out.
It transpired that they wanted £450 for the alleged damaged and even referred me to a debt collector so i then owed over £500.
I eventually paid but intend to take legal action independently and will no doubt gain support once up and running.
Avoid at all costs this company will defraud you however way they can. Their business model is to sell low but looks to upsale or defraud.
It is an absolute scam and i cannot believe they are still in business."
Ben Wood,2025-06-23,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/6859b1c9b8f2da0e46c9e924,"I strongly urge others not to use Europcar. My experience was nothing short of a rip-off. After returning a rental vehicle in good condition and signing what I believed was a routine check-in form, I was later hit with a staggering £714 charge for a tiny scratch.

There was no transparency about how this figure was calculated, no prior notification before the charge was applied, and no opportunity for a fair dispute. I formally raised concerns with customer service (Case #23359929), but the response was robotic and dismissive – no explanation, no breakdown of costs, and no engagement with the clear disparity between the ""damage"" and the fee.

The process feels deliberately opaque, and the customer support offered no real dialogue or justification for such an extortionate charge.

Warning to all renters:

Do not sign anything when returning the vehicle unless damage is properly reviewed with you on-site.

Document everything with photos.

Be aware Europcar may charge you excessively and without transparency.

This kind of behavior from a major rental company is unacceptable and exploitative. I am sharing my experience to prevent others from going through the same."

Mr French,2025-06-23,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/6859414794728e064a7a297c,"This was my first time hiring a car, and I am so frustrated with my experience with them. They gave me a car that had a screw in the tyre. Without going into all the details here, they basically accused me of lying. I wrote many emails of complaint but they still charged me £195 for a tyre. I had taken insurance with a different company because it was cheaper but honestly I have never known any company to have such little regard towards their customers. From start to finish with company, I would go as far to say that they are the worst company of any company I have ever experienced.
The dashboard said there was a low tyre as I was leaving the depot, so I had a quick look and judged that none looked low to the eye, and just thought I’d keep an eye on it and pump it up myself to get it to the correct level. According to them, I should have checked all the tyres for screws and nails before leaving. Are you serious? I drove home and left it on the drive over night. In the morning it was nearly completely flat. I drove to a petrol station to pump it up noticed a screw in the tyre. I called them and was told to take it back to the depot. I did this, and I was told to take to Kwik Fit. I was also told it would be free as it wasn’t my fault. The apparently have no recollection of this. Their customer service have been terribly rude, and condescending, and any emails I have sent have not been personable in any way. No apology for my bad experience due to their incompetencies."

Kim Collett,2025-06-21,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/6856ccfe839e76f3c3402e7b,"I was surprised to find so many negative reviews for Europcar as until recently I had used them several times and thought their service was good.
Sadly my last experience has shown me what their are really like. I inadvertently drove into an area in London that is no longer accessible to non-residents, unless you’re a guest. No longer living in London I didn’t know this and received a penalty notice.
I was surprised to receive it from Europcar week after my car was returned, but on realising it was my mistake I paid the notice and informed Europcar it had been settled. My complaint was that having paid the £65 fine promptly and thinking that was the end of the matter. Europcar then deducted another £45!! from my credit card to pay for their admin. I wrote to their customer services dept in case it was a mistake, as all they had to do was look up who was driving the car in question and send on an email informing them of the fine.
It would taken them 5-10 mins of their time to carry this out and for that they thought it was fair to charge £45 - which works out at an hourly rate of around £250-300p.h.
When I pointed this out the customer services department were obstructive and extremely rude, repeating the same comment that’s it’s in the t&c’s I had signed on hiring the car.
I tried to appeal against their argument but I kept receiving replies from the same 2 people who wouldn’t even listen to my point.
I understand that they need to make a charge for admin but £45 - on top of a £65 penalty notice is really extreme.
But it’s their poor customer service and the way my complaint was dealt with …or should I say ignored, that means they have lost yet another previously loyal customer. I need to hire a car every 4-6 weeks so they have lost my custom along with a lot of other people from what I am now reading.
Such a shame they are so short-sighted. Maybe the chiefs don’t know what the Indians are doing but if not then they deserve the criticism for not following the reviews on here."

When returning the vehicle at Europcar Praia da Rocha (Portimão), the company attempted to charge us an additional €167 for ""an extra day,"" despite returning the car on the agreed date. We were informed that our deposit would be refunded within 10 days. However, after this period elapsed, the deposit had not been received.

We contacted customer service, but their responses were unhelpful; representatives repeatedly disconnected our calls and were unable to provide clear information. Eventually, we were advised that the refund would take up to 28 days due to international processing times. Despite this, the deposit has still not been credited back to our account.

We have since liaised extensively with our bank and Europcar, but the issue remains unresolved. Customer service has been unhelpful throughout, and the situation is currently under investigation. We advise others to exercise caution when dealing with this company."

Made enquiries at their other office in the city, before realising they were not about to refund me, and they offered the same car type for twice the price. Walked the miles to the other depot, to find a damaged car which they would have been unable to hire to me anyway as the damage was so bad. Awful. Am needing to seek legal counsel to recoup money.

I reached out to customer service with full evidence (including a timestamped screenshot), only to be told “no coupon was applied” — a flat denial despite clear proof. Since then, I’ve sent follow-up emails and received no response whatsoever.

As a customer recently made redundant, I find this treatment not only financially unjust, but in breach of basic consumer rights.

I am now escalating the matter to Trading Standards, the Financial Ombudsman, and leaving this review to warn others.

Fernando,2025-06-15,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/684f105268dbe4e51df4e9fb,"Since the beginning of the rental, I have faced several problems with the vehicle. After going to the city of Porto (about half-an-hour from the airport) and parking the car, I realized that the doors did not lock with the remote control and that the car would not start. I contacted their helpline and was told that the vehicle would be towed and a taxi would be sent to take me to another Europcar counter.

About an hour later, I arrived at the counter on Rua Gonçalo Cristóvão, where I had to wait another hour to be served due to the high number of people. I requested priority service, since the problem was Europcar's responsibility, but I was treated with indifference and a lack of professionalism by an employee, whose response was that I would have to wait the necessary time and that it was not her who caused the problem. I consider this attitude unacceptable and completely disrespectful.

After finally delivering a second car to me, I continued on my journey. However, when I arrived at my destination, I realized, to my surprise, that the remote control of this new car did not lock the doors either. I was again forced to return to the same counter, where, after another wait, I was provided with a third car, without any apology.

Since I picked up the first vehicle at 8:30 am, I spent about four hours without access to a working car, which means that I spent that time without enjoying the service I had already paid for. This lost time compromised important commitments that I had scheduled, namely a trip to the Citizens' Shop, which caused even more delays and inconvenience in the following days. All of this was made worse by the fact that I had been awake since 2am, having arrived in Porto at 7:30am on a flight.

I have filed a claim 4 weeks ago and have received no reply yet. Very unprofessional"
Doc Taylor,2025-06-15,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/684e58deba61e685389aa2cc,"I wish to provide a candid warning to those contemplating the prospect of hiring from this company, particularly with regard to their Heathrow branch. This caution is underscored by a significant volume of negative reviews available online, and my experience is not isolated.

During my interaction with the Heathrow location, I was subjected to charges exceeding £200, categorised as a Premium Station surcharge. This fee is levied despite the availability of other provincial alternatives within a reasonable taxi or cab fare of approximately £20. Furthermore, I was charged for Super Premium Personal Accident Cover, which is redundant as I possess my own comprehensive annual coverage with premiums totalling less than the cost of their two-week charge. Additionally, their breakdown cover was almost twice the cost of a standard RAC or AA annual policy for annual duration.

Regrettably, I discovered these exorbitant charges only upon receipt of my invoice, as none of these fees were disclosed to me in advance. I strongly advise prospective customers to explore numerous online options for car hire excess cover provided by various insurers, which are available at a fraction of the costs imposed by this company. It is prudent to exercise caution; these charges are often hidden until after the transaction.

My attempts to rectify the situation were met with a lack of accountability. I engaged with a representative named Monica at a Spanish call centre, who assured me that the matter would be investigated. However, after a five-day interval, I was informed that no action had been taken, and I was told that Monica would face internal disciplinary measures.

Although a decision was made to refund my charges, I was subsequently informed that the process would take five days due to the sum exceeding their operational limits, necessitating approval from the UK. This was further compounded by a call handler abruptly ending our conversation when I sought clarification, stating that they were restricted in the length of calls. Once approval was secured, I was told that an additional ten days would be required for the funds to reach my account.

This level of indifference displayed by their representatives is striking, particularly in light of how they would likely respond if the roles were reversed and they were in a similar predicament. My experience has been distressing, exacerbating my PTSD with multiple triggers stemming from their deceptive practices.

I encourage anyone who has previously rented from this company to reassess their charges. Even years later, with the appropriate documentation, claims may be pursued in the County Court. To summarise:

1. Avoid utilising the Heathrow location.
2. Scrutinise all charges, regardless of the duration of your rental.
3. Research supplementary services available from various providers online.
4. Review competitor options thoroughly, paying particular attention to customer feedback.

Protect yourself and make informed decisions."

However, Europcar added extra paid services (premium insurance and roadside assistance) without clearly explaining them, even though we had already purchased full insurance coverage via Expedia.

Despite our complaints, Europcar refused any refund, relying solely on our signature and ignoring the language barrier and the context in which it was signed.

They gave me a dirty, unsafe baby seat that wouldn’t buckle, forcing me to go into Naples and buy a new one for €150 — which they refuse to refund. They told me a €100 deposit was included in the charges at the desk for pick-up, which I have not got back and had to raise a formal credit card dispute. They also gave wrong instructions to pick up the car, causing unwelcome delays with a baby. The staff were rude and dismissive and Europcar have closed my complaint even after I provided full details. Truly awful experience."

Eva Rothová,2025-06-11,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/6849362dac277ec55dfd70ab,"My entire experience with Europcar has been nothing short of shocking and deeply disappointing. Upon arriving at the rental desk, I was told that my reservation was ""blocked"" without any clear explanation, despite having a confirmed booking through Carflexi. I was then told I had no choice but to pay double the original price (for a new contract) for a different vehicle on the spot. Feeling pressured and stranded, I had no other choice than to comply.

What followed was a series of deceitful and contradictory actions that made it clear this was not an isolated incident, but rather what felt like a systematic scam.

The agent handling my rental, someone named Sheikh, presented a false ""upgrade"" that I had never agreed to, and I was misled about what I was actually being charged for. It later turned out that I had been mistakenly identified as someone else with the same name, which Europcar themselves admitted in writing, confirming the error was entirely on their side.

However, when I requested a refund for the extra charges caused by their own mistake, Europcar refused to accept any further responsibility. They effectively cut off communication and showed no willingness to resolve the issue, leaving me with no option but to escalate the case to the European Car Rental Conciliation Service (ECRCS).

To make matters worse, days after ECRCS confirmed I would be refunded £157 for the unjustified upgrade fee, Europcar attempted to charge my card an additional £142 without my consent. The only reason this unauthorized charge failed was because I had already transferred all remaining funds from that account, leaving no balance for them to take. I then had to urgently contact my bank and request the card be frozen to prevent any further attempts. This added yet more stress and time to an already exhausting situation.

I have never in my life encountered a company that operates with such blatant disregard for honesty, accountability, and customer trust. I strongly urge others to avoid Europcar, especially at this location (London, Heathrow), unless you are prepared to be deceived, overcharged, and ignored when things go wrong."

He told me that even if someone else scratches or hits my car I will have to pay a massive sum of money as excess. In the past I haven’t added this cover and had no issues but this time the attendant was being really pushy and made me feel so uncomfortable that I added it anyway. He made very clear to me the only charges that will come out my account is the extra protection charge, the deposit, and the toll payer. I double checked with him because I already felt very ripped off paying over double what I booked the car at and he reassured me that was all the costs- nothing else would be taken from me. After I gave my car back I got an invoice with 2 extra charges that made the total 3 TIMES what I initially agreed on. My card was already set up from when I collected so they took the money. I emailed them a whole month ago and they refuse to get back to me to explain why I was lied to about costs.

She refused to let us try paying on a different terminal and put us in the position where we were forced to pay a non-refundable fee of £208 on debit card or cancel the hire losing the deposit in the process.

No problem I thought, I'll take a picture of the dashboard and get on with my journey or else I'd be late for my meeting. Just to be sure though, I phoned the customer service line when I was free a few hours later to report the half full tank. They said they'd log the issue and could I please email in my picture of the dashboard, which I did.

I topped up the tank back to the half full level with 20 litres petrol before returning the car 2 days later having driven 221 miles (petrol hybrid). I mentioned to the agent on return about the fuel issue and naively thought that would be it sorted.

How wrong could I be - having been charged to refuel back to a full tank, I got in touch to remind Europcar about all the efforts I'd gone to inform them that I received the car half full. They have subsequently accused me of lying about this! Their attitude to customer service is just unbelievable...I've hired plenty times over the years, all of which they have on record, yet they assume that out of nowhere after being an honest customer for years, I suddenly want to get £50 fuel from them? I've sent pictures of the dashboard at time of pick-up and return that are time-stamped, clearly proving that I am right. I've sent a picture of the receipt showing I filled up with 20litres fuel - an ideal volume to have travelled 221 miles in a hybrid car! What more evidence do they need.

I was then unknowingly charged for the additional Insurance, actially adding a further £884 to my hire, I challenged them again requesting for the CCTV from when I collected the car as I wished it to be viewed in the hope a lip reader could translate my conversation with the member of staff that dealt with the hire.

I have emailed & called then raising concern and asking for an explanation, to date I have received a email response advising ""Once they obtain the relevant information they will be intouch"" I sent them screen shots of everything with my initial email 🙃 The email they email me from you can't reply to 🤔

About 4 hours later I received a telephone call from a private number with the caller saying he was from Fraud Prevention. I was asked if I had used my card within the last half hour, which I hadn't and was then asked if I had made a payment of £1 to Europcar earlier. I was told that a payment of £2000+ had been made using my card and that it would seem it had been cloned. My money would be refunded and a new card issued but I needed to give more digits from my card. I realised this was a scam so hung up and contacted my bank. They were very concerned about the caller knowing about Europcar and asked me to contact Europcar which I did.

We booked our rental through Auto Europe, unaware at the time that they act as a broker and that the actual rental would be fulfilled by Europcar. Had we known this in advance and read the reviews, we would never have gone ahead with the booking.

Upon arriving at Verona Airport, we eventually located the Europcar desk, and that’s when everything began to go wrong. The staff member at the desk was very insistent that we purchase additional insurance, despite the fact that we had already bought full protection through Auto Europe. Even after I phoned Auto Europe and they confirmed we were fully covered, the staff member continued to push the insurance, making us feel pressured and uncomfortable.

When we were finally given the keys, we discovered that the car provided was completely different from what we had booked. We had reserved a VW Tiguan or similar SUV specifically to fit our passengers and luggage, but were given a saloon instead. I returned to the desk, where I was told that SUVs and saloons fall into the same category. I contacted Auto Europe again, and after speaking with the Europcar desk staff, they informed me that nothing could be done as Europcar uses a different classification system than Auto Europe.

Eventually, a more suitable car was located, but we were told we’d have to wait 30 minutes while it was cleaned. In reality, we waited far longer — not an ideal start to a long-awaited holiday.

The car we were eventually given wasn't in the greatest condition, but at least it could accommodate both our group and our luggage and done the job. Still, the overall experience was disorganised, frustrating, and disappointing.

We left feeling exhausted before our trip had even begun. Based on our experience, I cannot recommend Europcar or Auto Europe and would urge others to think twice before booking."

I wonder if the van shows as returned because I have the return statement and the invoice, for which I paid in full. However, the driver was charged for insurance again at the branch on the collection day.

What if I keep the van since no one has been able to fix this inconvenience? I would not recommend this service at all.

I returned it, with no damage to the car, gas tank full, and got a return receipt as proof of that. I had already paid for the hire and full insurance prior to arrival, so when I queried the additional large charge to my credit card when I arrived back home 2 week later, I discovered they had in fact charged me twice for the one car hire. It has been extremely stressful given why I was in the UK in the first place, but then to have this extra charge on my card, it has caused me no-end of stress. I made a complaint, raised a claim and have heard NOTHING from them. They owe me almost £400 and I have not had any response from their claims team. PLEASE DON'T USE THEM. Unfortunately I am now involving a solicitor which they will end up paying for. Such a simple solution could have been given, with all my paperwork and proof of overcharges, they just needed to refund me. I hate giving bad reviews, but this time it is 100% warranted."

Avoid Europcar at Stansted at all costs. My wife was traveling urgently to visit a critically ill family member and was emotionally vulnerable. Europcar staff seized the opportunity to pressure her into a vehicle upgrade she never asked for, slipping in a £142+ charge that she was never made aware of — all disguised beneath a rushed signature.

Let me be clear: this was not a misunderstanding. This was exploitation. A predatory upsell tactic targeting someone in distress. And when we raised the issue, Europcar HQ responded with a robotic, tone-deaf statement dismissing it entirely — citing a ""signed document"" as though it excused the behavior.

Worse still, the Cardiff Europcar branch reviewed the situation and told us clearly: 'this would never happen under our watch.' So yes — the Stansted team is acting on its own agenda and damaging the Europcar brand in the process.

This was manipulative, unethical, and cowardly. If this is how Europcar treats long-time customers and Privilege Members, they deserve every bit of reputational damage this review brings.

We are escalating this to senior management, Trading Standards, the Competition and Markets Authority, and the ECRCS.

The desk at Heathrow, led by Shane the manager, are nothing more than con artists who forcefully upsell and trick people into massively overpaying, and the customer service is useless when trying to recover some of the fees.

When I refilled the tank with diesel I was expecting to only put a gallon of fuel in. But, to my surprise I had to put 3 gallons in to replace (top up) what I had used as I was informed that the van had a full tank of fuel when I picked it up.

So, obviously the fuel tank wasn’t full when I picked the van up but I was told the tank was full and it should be returned with a full tank. I spoke with the branch manager at Chelmsford where I rented the van from and requested a refund for the 2 additional gallons of fuel that I had put in their van.

The million dollar question is… are they carrying out sharp practice to fleece their customers or is it some skullduggery from an employee, either way it’s not right.

Be warned make a note of the mileage and the average mpg used whilst in your rental.

I have twice been on their website to complain, filled in all the questions, written a lengthy complaint and when I pushed the upload button it defaults to “there is an issue with our webpage” handy so I am left writing this review to vent my frustration…

The receiving agent spotted a scratch in the bonnet, that I hadn't seen at pick up, and had to squint in certain lights to see when she pointed it out. It could easily have been there when we picked up the car and I wouldn't have seen it. We rubbed the 'scratch' with a bit of water and a thumb and it appeared to be lifting, so I thought nothing more of it as I was convinced a polish would buff it out.

When I returned back to England I got a bill for £320 to repair the 'damage'. I tried to challenge them, but got stock corporate responses demonstrating how little they cared.

They are cheap, but avoid as you will be ripped off if there is any hint of damage. I will never use them again.

The attendant at the reception was not just rude — she was downright hostile. She repeatedly pressured me to accept unnecessary add-ons and even went so far as to suggest I’d likely end up in an accident for declining the additional insurance excess reduction. That kind of fearmongering is completely unacceptable. She asked the same intrusive questions multiple times — “How far are you going?” “When exactly are you bringing it back?” — in a tone that made me feel like I was begging to borrow her personal vehicle rather than paying to rent from a major company. The whole exchange was uncomfortable, condescending, and frankly, humiliating. At one point, I was so taken aback by her attitude, I genuinely considered walking away and telling her to keep the van. Renting a vehicle shouldn’t feel like being interrogated or talked down to. If this is how Europcar treats paying, polite customers — then count me out for good.

From the beginning, we were treated with arrogance and disrespect. I had booked a decent car, and they handed me a wreck – filthy, falling apart, and barely drivable. It looked like it belonged in a junkyard. An absolute disgrace.

I had purchased full insurance coverage, so I wasn’t supposed to be charged for anything. Still, they held a deposit of £125, which was initially released, and then they took the money from my account after I had already left, with no explanation. That’s not a mistake – that’s outright theft.

This is not just poor service – it’s dishonest and unethical. Europcar in Tunis is running a scam. What they’re doing is not car rental, it’s abuse and legalized robbery.

We ended up paying €1000 for a basic 208 Peugeot which on their website was €300 when we initially paid for it. They also scammed us with €200 for a 3cm scuff on the wheel which was there before we rented the car, I showed the picture to them and the representative said I shouldn’t worry because it’s covered by the insurance (this was of course a lie) but they just need to record it for the next rental. They then also billed €87 for the damage admin fee. Be prepared to never see your deposit back and once you return the car if you don’t have a credit card then make sure you move the money from your account as they will just start charging random amounts to your debit card. Make sure you email all photos and videos and detailed description 1hr after you get the car as otherwise they won’t care what photos or videos you have. They lie, scam and steal and add secret charges that you didn’t ask for. We didn’t ask for roadside assistance and somehow it showed up on the invoice. There’s also a massive airport fee which they don’t tell you about in advance. Every price they say is without VAT, which they forget to mentioned. Do yourself a favour and find a local/family owned company outside of the airport and never go near Europcar as you will be robbed. Hopefully someone will eventually win a legal case against them."

My friend was clever enough to catch them before he signed. I was not, and it tripled the cost of the rental.

Diane,2025-05-27,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/683454ab63c09ef563630f65,"BUYER BEWARE if you are thinking about renting a car from Europcar.
After reserving and paying for a car rental through a third party before leaving the United States, on arrival in Southampton I presented the 3rd party rental voucher to the Europcar agent who accepted it without comment. He told me, however, that the car I reserved was not available and I was offered an upgrade for £9 a day extra for the 14-day rental period. I accepted this and the agent made out a rental agreement reflecting the upcharge. At no time did the agent in Southampton tell me that the payment we made through the 3rd party would be disregarded and that Europcar would be re-billing the entire rental amount again. However, 4 days after returning the car, Europcar charged my credit card the full rental price plus the upgrade charge. In other words, I ended up paying for the car twice.
After calling the company’s customer service three times and explaining the situation by email, my complaint fell on deaf ears. I was finally told that the voucher I presented in Southampton and that the agent accepted and kept without comment had not been applied.
To add insult to injury, upon returning the car at the exact time and date stated on the rental agreement (as confirmed by the agent who received the car), I was charged for an extra day after being told the car should have been returned an hour earlier.
Apart from being conned out of more than $500, the worst part of this experience has been trying to communicate with a company that is completely deaf to their customers concerns. The customer service rep., who is located somewhere overseas, will let you talk about your problem endlessly and then do nothing about it. Ask to speak to a supervisor: ‘sorry there are none’. I have to assume that using bait and switch tactics to justify ignoring payments from third parties is a common Europcar practice in order to avoid paying fees to those parties.
Since we still needed an additional rental in the UK, we discovered Drivalia, which came highly recommended. It is understandable because their rates are half of what Europcar charges and their customer service reps are extremely friendly and accommodating.
Hopefully, my own experience with Europcar’s unethical business practices will serve as a caution to anyone in future looking to do business with an ethical car rental company.

Review update: In response to Europcar's standard corporate response.
We had already contacted Europcar 4 times by phone and email, detailing the complaint. They have either not bothered responding at all or on one occasion were completely dismissive.

The other depots both said we should not have been charged more for the car and they hadn't heard of any luggage laws as told to us.
1. We asked the guy in Edinburgh to try our luggage in the car we hired but he refused. He told us there were restrictions on putting luggage on the rear seat (a small carry on bag) He also told us the police were on the lookout for hire cars doing this on the North Coast 500, not knowing the laws we believed him. But I haven't seen any corroboration on the internet to say this is true.
2. We went to Inverness to swap our car as instructed by Europcar's head office via email.
3. Inverness advised us he had not heard from head office and advised us to keep going as smaller cars are like hens teeth. What did they expect us to do? We had already paid $1900aus and had pre booked accommodation.
4. We only signed because we had to have something because we were booked ahead.
5. At no time after we went to Inverness depot were we instructed to go back for a smaller car which we would have done. So why were we instructed to go to Inverness only to find no car available, and why weren't we told to come back the next day or at some other time...were we expected to walk around Scotland??
All of the above borders on a shonky deal and we have been trying to resolve this since April 24th....how long does it take.
The contract was signed after we assumed the story we were told was true but since found out it was dubious at best so....if you sign a contract under wrong assumptions it should be voided. Was the initial amount we paid not considered?
The car had lollies and other packets in the glove box...the guy in Edinburgh said we might have to fill up with Adblue which we had to do on the first fill of the tank....this should be done by Europcar not the customer...there was no manual in the car so we could not learn anything about how the controls worked. We would never recommend Europcar to anyone, quite the opposite especially when we have been fobbed off with the phrase ""but you signed the contract"" so even though we were told a story to get us into a bigger car which we didn't want and didn't order it doesn't matter to Europcar?
We booked a Citroen C3 or similar and we would have easily fit our luggage in that sized car. When we took the car back to Manchester Trafford Park the man who took delivery of the car was called Usama and he told us we should not have to put Adblue in the car as it's Europcar's job to do it...he said the guy in Edinburgh might have lied to get a bigger bonus...he said we would be reimbursed for the Adblue and the bond money both of which we are yet to see.

For a 6 day hire my bill so far is gbp 400 plus deposit. I feel totally ripped off. I have not been able to drive the car because a tyre had 2 holes in it and no one was interested in resolving the problem. I have been stuck in one place waiting for repairs to be done. There was no spare tyre.
I went through Rentalcar.com which is a broker. I was in a difficult situation and had to hire in a hurry for a next day, Saturday, start. I requested a Leeds city pick up and Manchester airport drop off on Thursday. I was charged 233gbp, then 85gbp extra when I went to pick up the car because the ‘different drop off location’ had ‘dropped off’. Plus a deposit which was ok and expected, if large. There was another extra charge for road usage when I picked up the vehicle. Prices are advertised in GBP but my UK credit card was charged in NZ dollars - I’m using an NZ mobile phone and drivers license but there was no obvious option to change the currency quoted/charged in. So then the insurance cover was added - the wording strongly suggests you need their full insurance offer. This was £65 for 6 days. Charging my UK credit card in NZ$ incurred four times unnecessary conversion fees. By now I’m committed and don’t have time (or energy because I’m dealing with a family emergency and really need a good reliable car, right now) to find another supplier so accepted the deal.
I booked a 10am pick up. There was a 15’ wait before being able to begin completing the paperwork and pick up the car. The car itself is ungroomed in the interior, and didn’t drive well from the get go. Shortly after leaving the pick up point an alarm appeared saying ‘tyre pressure low’. I did not have time to deal with this immediately. When I called Europcar (the end supplier) two days later, by which time the wheel alignment feels obviously wrong, I waited a very long time for an answer and was eventually shunted through to someone who turned out to be the AA who came out to check the car through their breakdown service. Whilst the AA is always great, I could have called them on my own membership and saved the 30 minutes + waiting for Europcar to answer. So at this point I had no usable car (for which I’ve paid a very expensive total hire rate) and was stuck waiting for a roadside rescue service to help me out with ‘my’ problem. The AA turned up as promised an hour later, removed a nail ‘which has been in there a long time’, did a temporary fix so I could get to some local appointments early the next day (having by now not been able to get to that day’s necessary hospital visit and run other urgent medical-related errands), and booked a new tyre service Kwikfit who replaced the tyre the next day. They found another nail in the tyre and let slip that poor quality tyres on loaned-out vehicles are a common problem with Europcar vehicles. The worst part of this is that Europcar do not answer the phone and even when they do couldn’t give a damn. When I did eventually get through to a customer service agent she was smugly rude by just meeting my concerns with deliberate silence. She finally put me through to ‘the local branch’ (an ad loop telling lies about how great Europcar is) which clearly no one answers) where I was on hold over 30’ before I gave up. Worst customer experience ever. Will never use rentalcar.com or Europcar ever again."
