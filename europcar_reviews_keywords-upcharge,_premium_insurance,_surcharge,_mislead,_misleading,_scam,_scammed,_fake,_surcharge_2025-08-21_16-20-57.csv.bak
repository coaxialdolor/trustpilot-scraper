Fraser Barclay,2025-08-18,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/68a35bae487be95dfdd67e64,"After using this company for car rentals quite often over a few years, I thought I'd grown to trust them as one of the better car rental companies that weren't out to scam you at every possible opportunity.

Unfortunately, I was proven wrong when I was handed a cleaning fee for having some dirt, from a shoe, in the footwell of the car. This was deemed excessive and upon querying the matter, I was told this would require 'expert third party cleaners ' and 'the cleaning of a interior specialist'.

Direct quotes, yet evidence of this was never produced and I was ignored for over a month before receiving a dismissive email saying they will not be replying any more.

If only photos were allowed on this platform to show how little dirt was apparently deemed to be excessive. I have since moved to using other car rental companies, as this lack of customer service for a long-standing customer, or anyone, is just not good enough.

I will be reporting them to the British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association for breaching their code of conduct in their handling of this matter."

If I could rate this company 0 stars, I would. Europcar is a scam company that happily takes money from customers but doesn’t provide the car you booked. They confirmed my reservation and took my payment without doing the necessary checks. I travelled all the way to London City Airport, only to be told I couldn’t collect the car.

This company wastes people’s time and money, and it feels like they take bookings just to hold customers’ money for their own interest. Disgraceful service, no accountability, and a complete scam. Avoid Europcar at all costs."
Stephen,2025-08-17,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/68a1fb6daedae13a4779b81b,"Scammers, extremely shady outfit.

I picked up my car in Johannesburg and they tried to give me a car without a damage report, telling me “it will be fine”.

Upon checking the car it had clearly been in some form of accident. It took an hour of refusing to take the car without damage report for them to finally say they would bring me a new car at my address later, but that I should take this one for now (I assume they then would have said the car was damaged by in the time between me taking it and them brining the new one).

Travelling with a newborn, this was stressful and they eventually brought me a new car with a damage report and assured me that I had the maximum insurance. Unfortunately this was not the case as I was hit by a driver running a red light and Europcar took £2000 from me.

Be careful, these guys are extremely shady."

Booked in advance but because they wouldnt accept different cards we had we were forced to take out their insurance for the week which was more than the cost of the car hire. We had arranged our own insurance at a tenth of the price but they would not even look at the paperwork. It was late with only a few other companies open and limited availability. When I asked why the insurance was so high they said it was a local insurance company. Never given a policy document just €268 item on the bill. We still had to pay a deposit. Read other reviews and see this is a common scam by them.
Duped Norris,2025-08-13,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/689c35cb5c8c0d8ef6fa8b12,"I had a prepaid car rental voucher for a predetermined type vehicle through a third-party provider. I went to collect the vehicle from EuropCar Gatwick South Terminal to be told by the female EuroCar employee that the vehicle we ordered was not available. She said “We are giving you a free upgrade”. No mention of cost we would pay etc. because we were told they were GIVING us an upgrade. GIVING! It is my understanding that under law, if the company cannot provide the car ordered (and paid for) they must offer either a free upgrade or a lesser vehicle with a monetary refund, The upgrade was a very luxurious vehicle and I was immediately resistant and anxious and expressed deep concern to her, I was told by the female agent not to worry, the vehicle was at the end of its rental life, it had 50,000 miles on the odometer, which it did, and it was to be disposed of when I returned it. Reluctantly I accepted it. I felt it had been foisted upon me. When I was outside loading the car, the female agent came out and said the car had damaged wheels and I had to sign a form to acknowledge the damage. She presented form with a diagram of the car, both sides, with X marks on the wheels. I now realise she had folded the paper in half so that I couldn’t see what was on the other side. I really thought the shonky, trickster days of car hire had long gone. Boy was I wrong!!!
In hindsight I should have said NO! NO! NO and I should have run away, screaming, and rung the third-party provider and complained, but I didn’t, fool that I am. However, after 26 hours of travel I was exhausted, and yes, I now know I was dimwitted not to spot a scam in the making.
I hated the car from the start. This car wrecked my entire holiday and nearly wrecked me. I was highly anxious when I drove it and it made me quite ill from worry, It was too large and too wide for UK parking spaces. It literally got stuck in the entry to a shopping centre car park. It gave my daughter high level anxiety attacks. I had to try to park it away from other cars because I was terrified they would dent the car’s doors. This car was just too big,and too wide for UK narrow roads, even some A roads were scary and it did things I found hard to accept. It was so technical it was dangerous, simply because it was distracting.
But just as importantly, mechanically it was difficult. When the car started off there were many times when it just didn’t want to change up gears. Leaving Cobham Services, the car wouldn’t change gears at all and I held my breath thinking I would need a tow truck, but eventually it did change up. I am used to driving a Subaru with CVT automatic, but this vehicle had a habit of just stopping and not moving off. It would stop and go into Neutral and once you realised why the car wasn’t moving and what had happened, you had to go through the set process to get it going again. This happened in dangerous places at times like waiting to enter a large roundabout on a 70mph road. A friend suggested I return the car and I jolly well wish I had.
On the day I had to return the car to Gatwick, a yellow message about the tyres appeared on the consol. 8 calls to EuropCar proved useless and so I drove just down the road to the local dealership for the marque. Service personnel said it was ok to drive it back and gave me instructions as to what to do with the gadget in the trunk should tyre pressure deteriorate. And this is how I returned the car.
During the term of the car hire I did check my credit card several times to see if EuropCar had levied the £1500 block for security and I was surprised they had not. I returned the car on 1 August and flew home. The day after I arrived home, I checked my credit card and found that at between the 29 July and 9 August (8 days after I had returned the car) EuropCar had charged me $3,630.06 in my money for the upgrade they told me they were GIVING me because they were unable to supply the car I had ordered and prepaid for. It was then that I remembered the woman who asked me to sign the document acknowledging the damage to the car, and it was then that I realised she had folded the document in half and therefore I could not see what was on the other side-the upgrade charges etc.What a Fool I am
I have lodged a dispute but EuropCarUK is notorious for completely ignoring disputes. I am told that what this woman did could be a criminal offence called Fraudulent Misrepresentation. Some could ask whether she is highly skilled in the dark arts of duplicity and deception? Of course I will not be letting this matter go and others in the travel and insurance industries have been advised. Eventually when I can confidently tell the Citizens Advice Bureau,Trading Standards,Watchdog and Rip-off Britain that EuropCar has done absolutely nothing to resolve my dispute,then I will lodge a dispute with the BVRLA to whom EuropCar belong."

1️⃣ Hidden & Duplicate Charges
My booking clearly stated that Airport Surcharge and Vehicle Licence Fee were prepaid. But after returning the car, I was charged again for: Licenses and Fees &
Premium Station Surcharge

Europcar claimed these were “not charged again,” just shown again. Yet, £214.41 was deducted from my credit card — part of which they admit was £180.18 for Roadside Assistance, which I never intended to buy. That leaves £34.23 unexplained.

2️⃣ Misleading Upselling
Despite already having full insurance, I was pressured to buy Roadside Assistance at pickup. The staff explicitly told me it would not cost extra and was “included in the basic insurance.” This is clearly false and designed to exploit tourists unfamiliar with UK rental terms.

3️⃣ Admin Fees Without Proof
Charged £45 per “admin fee” for supposed fines or tolls — yet no evidence or notice was ever provided.

Rented a car for a week in Birmingham at EuroPcar

Had a full insurance over booking.com and when I arrived at the place to pick up the car, the staff just told me that their system can't accept the insurance that I bought over booking.com

The staff then forced me to buy one of their premium insurances before they would give me the keys to the car while then getting in contact with a person. They knew who to call at booking.com to force the cancelation of my insurance from there. My original price when I booked the car was around 60 pounds which then was changed to 250 + 100 in deposit.

The choice I had were 250 gbp + 100 gbp in deposit for full insurance
150 gbp + 200 gbp in deposit for half insurance
and the most outrages one was 87 gbp + 700 gbp in deposit for only windshield insurance

Had to talk with the support 3 times and on the second time I called in toto hear about the deposit. The lady on the phone just said I should wait and placed me on a waiting line just to end the call.

It wasn’t until I looked at the invoice at home and saw a charge for premium insurance which had been added on top of the full cover insurance I had already purchased online.

So I emailed them once I had returned the car and keys to the out of office box.
This was in February. I have formally complained 3? times now. And nothing. I left a review on Google and Europcar just sent me the link to complain, the same link I’ve used several times already with no response.

I strongly advise against renting a car from Europcar. Our experience was extremely disappointing and felt intentionally misleading. Upon arrival, we were pressured into renting a larger car than we originally booked, with the agent quoting us a price that did not include VAT—a detail they conveniently failed to mention until after we agreed.

To make matters worse, we were charged an unexpected Station Fee that was never disclosed on the website or in our confirmation email. These hidden costs added up quickly and left us feeling scammed.

I booked a car online through Europcar at an average daily rate of £15. When I arrived at the Sheffield branch to collect the vehicle, I was told that the car I reserved was not available. Instead, they offered a Tesla and demanded an extra £30 per day for the upgrade during my 9-day rental.

When I declined, they offered another vehicle for an additional £12 per day. Again, I refused, and they then claimed that no other vehicles were available and that I would need to wait 3–4 hours for a car to be returned.

I had taken time off work and planned everything around this rental. After insisting firmly, they eventually gave me a car they had on-site — clearly proving that vehicles were available all along.

This company is clearly trying to upsell and exploit customers instead of honoring bookings. I had many options when booking, and I deeply regret choosing Europcar. They wasted over an hour of my time and caused unnecessary stress.

If the agreed vehicle is not available, you are supposed to upgrade the customer at no extra cost — not try to profit from the situation. This is unacceptable.

We returned the car and left the keys in the cabin as there was no staff so we assumed that was it.
I complained about an invoice for £100 which i thought had been charged for alleged damage. I complained and said that i didn't and couldn't have caused the damage.....and that the damage shown would cost £5 to polish out.
It transpired that they wanted £450 for the alleged damaged and even referred me to a debt collector so i then owed over £500.
I eventually paid but intend to take legal action independently and will no doubt gain support once up and running.

Doc Taylor,2025-06-15,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/684e58deba61e685389aa2cc,"I wish to provide a candid warning to those contemplating the prospect of hiring from this company, particularly with regard to their Heathrow branch. This caution is underscored by a significant volume of negative reviews available online, and my experience is not isolated.

During my interaction with the Heathrow location, I was subjected to charges exceeding £200, categorised as a Premium Station surcharge. This fee is levied despite the availability of other provincial alternatives within a reasonable taxi or cab fare of approximately £20. Furthermore, I was charged for Super Premium Personal Accident Cover, which is redundant as I possess my own comprehensive annual coverage with premiums totalling less than the cost of their two-week charge. Additionally, their breakdown cover was almost twice the cost of a standard RAC or AA annual policy for annual duration.

Regrettably, I discovered these exorbitant charges only upon receipt of my invoice, as none of these fees were disclosed to me in advance. I strongly advise prospective customers to explore numerous online options for car hire excess cover provided by various insurers, which are available at a fraction of the costs imposed by this company. It is prudent to exercise caution; these charges are often hidden until after the transaction.

My attempts to rectify the situation were met with a lack of accountability. I engaged with a representative named Monica at a Spanish call centre, who assured me that the matter would be investigated. However, after a five-day interval, I was informed that no action had been taken, and I was told that Monica would face internal disciplinary measures.

Although a decision was made to refund my charges, I was subsequently informed that the process would take five days due to the sum exceeding their operational limits, necessitating approval from the UK. This was further compounded by a call handler abruptly ending our conversation when I sought clarification, stating that they were restricted in the length of calls. Once approval was secured, I was told that an additional ten days would be required for the funds to reach my account.

This level of indifference displayed by their representatives is striking, particularly in light of how they would likely respond if the roles were reversed and they were in a similar predicament. My experience has been distressing, exacerbating my PTSD with multiple triggers stemming from their deceptive practices.

I encourage anyone who has previously rented from this company to reassess their charges. Even years later, with the appropriate documentation, claims may be pursued in the County Court. To summarise:

1. Avoid utilising the Heathrow location.
2. Scrutinise all charges, regardless of the duration of your rental.
3. Research supplementary services available from various providers online.
4. Review competitor options thoroughly, paying particular attention to customer feedback.

Protect yourself and make informed decisions."

However, Europcar added extra paid services (premium insurance and roadside assistance) without clearly explaining them, even though we had already purchased full insurance coverage via Expedia.

Despite our complaints, Europcar refused any refund, relying solely on our signature and ignoring the language barrier and the context in which it was signed.

Eva Rothová,2025-06-11,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/6849362dac277ec55dfd70ab,"My entire experience with Europcar has been nothing short of shocking and deeply disappointing. Upon arriving at the rental desk, I was told that my reservation was ""blocked"" without any clear explanation, despite having a confirmed booking through Carflexi. I was then told I had no choice but to pay double the original price (for a new contract) for a different vehicle on the spot. Feeling pressured and stranded, I had no other choice than to comply.

What followed was a series of deceitful and contradictory actions that made it clear this was not an isolated incident, but rather what felt like a systematic scam.

The agent handling my rental, someone named Sheikh, presented a false ""upgrade"" that I had never agreed to, and I was misled about what I was actually being charged for. It later turned out that I had been mistakenly identified as someone else with the same name, which Europcar themselves admitted in writing, confirming the error was entirely on their side.

However, when I requested a refund for the extra charges caused by their own mistake, Europcar refused to accept any further responsibility. They effectively cut off communication and showed no willingness to resolve the issue, leaving me with no option but to escalate the case to the European Car Rental Conciliation Service (ECRCS).

To make matters worse, days after ECRCS confirmed I would be refunded £157 for the unjustified upgrade fee, Europcar attempted to charge my card an additional £142 without my consent. The only reason this unauthorized charge failed was because I had already transferred all remaining funds from that account, leaving no balance for them to take. I then had to urgently contact my bank and request the card be frozen to prevent any further attempts. This added yet more stress and time to an already exhausting situation.

I have never in my life encountered a company that operates with such blatant disregard for honesty, accountability, and customer trust.

Then i had 2 payments taken from my account for £380, I found out that the representive had added premium insurance without my knowledge and after many emails to there customer service department they refused to refund the charge.

From the beginning, we were treated with arrogance and disrespect. I had booked a decent car, and they handed me a wreck – filthy, falling apart, and barely drivable. It looked like it belonged in a junkyard. An absolute disgrace.

I had purchased full insurance coverage, so I wasn’t supposed to be charged for anything. Still, they held a deposit of £125, which was initially released, and then they took the money from my account after I had already left, with no explanation. That’s not a mistake – that’s outright theft.

This is not just poor service – it’s dishonest and unethical. Europcar in Tunis is running a scam. What they’re doing is not car rental, it’s abuse and legalized robbery.

Avoid this company at all costs. I wouldn’t wish this experience on anyone."

We ended up paying €1000 for a basic 208 Peugeot which on their website was €300 when we initially paid for it. They also scammed us with €200 for a 3cm scuff on the wheel which was there before we rented the car, I showed the picture to them and the representative said I shouldn’t worry because it’s covered by the insurance (this was of course a lie) but they just need to record it for the next rental. They then also billed €87 for the damage admin fee. Be prepared to never see your deposit back and once you return the car if you don’t have a credit card then make sure you move the money from your account as they will just start charging random amounts to your debit card. Make sure you email all photos and videos and detailed description 1hr after you get the car as otherwise they won’t care what photos or videos you have. They lie, scam and steal and add secret charges that you didn’t ask for. We didn’t ask for roadside assistance and somehow it showed up on the invoice. There’s also a massive airport fee which they don’t tell you about in advance. Every price they say is without VAT, which they forget to mentioned. Do yourself a favour and find a local/family owned company outside of the airport and never go near Europcar as you will be robbed. Hopefully someone will eventually win a legal case against them."
Diane,2025-05-27,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/683454ab63c09ef563630f65,"BUYER BEWARE if you are thinking about renting a car from Europcar.
After reserving and paying for a car rental through a third party before leaving the United States, on arrival in Southampton I presented the 3rd party rental voucher to the Europcar agent who accepted it without comment. He told me, however, that the car I reserved was not available and I was offered an upgrade for £9 a day extra for the 14-day rental period. I accepted this and the agent made out a rental agreement reflecting the upcharge. At no time did the agent in Southampton tell me that the payment we made through the 3rd party would be disregarded and that Europcar would be re-billing the entire rental amount again. However, 4 days after returning the car, Europcar charged my credit card the full rental price plus the upgrade charge. In other words, I ended up paying for the car twice.
After calling the company’s customer service three times and explaining the situation by email, my complaint fell on deaf ears. I was finally told that the voucher I presented in Southampton and that the agent accepted and kept without comment had not been applied.
To add insult to injury, upon returning the car at the exact time and date stated on the rental agreement (as confirmed by the agent who received the car), I was charged for an extra day after being told the car should have been returned an hour earlier.
Apart from being conned out of more than $500, the worst part of this experience has been trying to communicate with a company that is completely deaf to their customers concerns. The customer service rep., who is located somewhere overseas, will let you talk about your problem endlessly and then do nothing about it. Ask to speak to a supervisor: ‘sorry there are none’. I have to assume that using bait and switch tactics to justify ignoring payments from third parties is a common Europcar practice in order to avoid paying fees to those parties.
Since we still needed an additional rental in the UK, we discovered Drivalia, which came highly recommended. It is understandable because their rates are half of what Europcar charges and their customer service reps are extremely friendly and accommodating.
Hopefully, my own experience with Europcar’s unethical business practices will serve as a caution to anyone in future looking to do business with an ethical car rental company.

Review update: In response to Europcar's standard corporate response.
We had already contacted Europcar 4 times by phone and email, detailing the complaint. They have either not bothered responding at all or on one occasion were completely dismissive.
The attempt by Europcar to act like they care now is nothing more than a laughable PR stunt."

We booked a small car to go away for the long weekend in the beginning of May and everything went well, they even gave us an upgrade which was amazing. Quick to pick up the car, great to bring it back, everything speedy...

However.... not being a local and not having driven loads in the UK roads, it can be extremely hard to avoid getting an automatic fine. I went into a bus lane on a Monday (bank holiday though) on an empty road, at a junction that is designed so you will unavoidably touch the bus lane if you are not laser focused on the markings on the road. A very scammy, tricky place to get a fine.

I get the fine on my email. £35. Angry but i said ok, better luck next time. Then i see that Europcar thinks its ok to add a £45 'administration' fee, as if they have to do anything time consuming, other than send an email.

So they want MORE than the fine because what you can do? Its in the booklong terms and conditions.

Fear not, i will pay you this administration fee but you WILL NEVER SEE ME AGAIN as a customer.

I took great care to be careful with the car and return it in great shape, i was on time and i get 'fined' with nothing, so you can pocket easy money? That's the last you will ever see from me again. Bye!"

Seems to be a theme about mis selling insurance. I am currently ""in conversation"" with customer services about added extras I never ordered and I am looking for a refund. I never requested roadside assistance or personal protection but these were added to invoice. This is a scam where they make these additions part of your deposit. It is basically theft.

Customer services have now told me that cannot do anything as they were not part of verbal conservation at location - they have said that I should have been offered extras and asked to accept or decline which never happened.

So basically buyer should be aware of this practice and scrutinise what you are signing up for and make sure no extras have been added surreptitiously

I would also beware of premium location surcharge that is added to costs.
I certainly will not hire from them again."

I was requested under pressure to pay extra £71.40 as “After Hours” fee when we arrived Birmingham airport for car collection.
Due to a flight delay, we arrived at 11:04 PM—just 4 minutes past office hours
We did promptly call their office at 7:30pm (UK time) in Italy before departure once we knew there was flight delay. This staff, who is on duty, confirmed he could wait up to 30 minutes beyond the usual closing time – until 11:30 PM. We expressed our deep appreciation in phone.
Before making the car booking, we contacted your Customer Service team to clarify what would happen in the event of a flight delay, given that your office hours end at 11:00 PM. We were assured that, as long as we provided our flight number, your staff would monitor our arrival and wait for us accordingly. Based on this reassurance, we proceeded with the booking and submitted our flight information
We explained our situation and referenced the prior conversation with that staff. However, he remained adamant. When we requested an official policy document justifying this charge, he became defensive, accused us of being impolite, and refused to provide any documentation. He then stated that unless we paid the fee, he would close the office and WITHOUHOLD the car.
Adding to our discomfort, before demanding the late fee, this staff spent over five minutes trying to upsell us additional insurance. We informed him that we had already purchased full coverage. He replied confidently—but misleadingly—that full coverage did not include wheels and tires, and pressured us to purchase more coverage. When we declined, his attitude changed abruptly, and he immediately brought up the “After Hours” charge.
Lastly, when we arrived at 11:04 PM, the staff member had just finished completing the documentation for the previous customer. He was not simply waiting in the office for serving us.
I fully agree that flight delay was not Europcar’s fault and was not their responsible for this either.
However, they did not keep promise and still charged us after failing to sell us insurance, simply because we were only 4 minutes late.
They not only refused to issue a refund, but also failed to provide any documentation justifying the 'late charge' as per their Terms and Conditions

The errors this company has made against me has cost me thousands of pounds. I am currently trying to retrieve over £1100 that Europcar took out of my account on a saturday morning without any authorisation and having never had a hire car from them. I tried to get a hire the previous month for work for 30 days. I entered everything for them and paid in full before going to collect the car from Manchester airport. When I got there the very aggressive and uninterested staff informed me that they were going to do a credit check on my address. I was not worried as I own my own house lived there for years and don't do credit or debt. The guy comes back and refuses me the car hire. I'm like hang on this can't be right. Also why was this check not done before I'd paid my money. The staff refused to help me I any way and would not allow me to speak to a more senior member of staff. There message to me was go somewhere else you are not getting anything from us today. I was left standing there having giving up the day to collect the car in the first place. I was informed that it would take 20 days to get my money back. Europcar held my money in their account making interest for days before I eventually got it back. No car and no money for 10 days. I launched an investigation to find out why my address had an issue only to find out that the poorly educated and extremely rude member of staff had entered next doors address. I feel he did it on purpose. These guys were a real bad bunch at Manchester Airport Branch. On the 28th April for no reason Europcar took from my account the money again. I have still nor had it back. There is no one to complain to at Europcar there is no real customer service to speak off. These accessed my personal data withdraw money from my account and have held onto it. I have had to register it as a theft with he police I've had to buy a vehicle in order to start my new job at the cost of £8000 taxed and insured lost days in work as a result of it. I don't think I've ever been so badly treated by a company in my life. I actually thought that this type of behaviour by a company was not possible in this day and age but it is.

At least this time he was honest and told me that there's nothing I can do and they reached out to me on trust pilot just so they look that they are trying.
Big surprise there...
Wow, this company is rotten to the core.

On April 10th we flew to Heathrow, and we took a shuttle to Europcar to pick up the car we already paid for online.
The guy at the desk started to push a free upgrade, a Mercedes GLE SUV. I said I don’t want it because it is an expensive car, but he insisted, saying that the car is not new and has scratches.
Eventually we agreed and he said there’s a deposit of 284 GBP that will be refunded when we return the car.
That’s when he realized that my wife’s driver’s license is expired, but because he was eager to scam us he finished the papers making her the main driver which should be not only against their policies but also illegal. Of course she didn’t drive at all, I was doing all the driving.
I signed the papers and then he said that because it is a free upgrade a manager will have to sign.
The manager came and he signed then we left. What I didn’t realize was that the manage added a 4 in front of 284 making it 4284 GBP.
Also, we didn’t realize until later that they didn’t take any deposit from the visa (for the obvious reasons).

When we returned the car, we noticed the amount on the back, and we asked to speak to the manager (a different one).
He was right in front of us, but we had to wait about 20 minutes because he was trying to push an upgrade to a family.
Eventually we talked to him and he said that it is our fault for signing and he pretty much called me stupid.
We tried to lock the Visa, but it was too late.

We returned to Canada and immediately called Europcar customer Service and talked to Agostina.
I explained the situation including the expired license. She gave us a case number and said she will e-mail us with a resolution.
After couple of hours we got and e-mail for her saying that our request was respectfully denied.
I called again and talked to Leo. I explained to him the situation again, stressing the fact that the contract should be void because
it was issued knowing that the main driver’s license is expired. He agreed and said that maybe Agostina overlooked that aspect.
He gave me a new case number and said he will e-mail us within a day.
The next day we got the e-mail, and he respectfully denied the refund saying “even in the case Mrs Bogatan would not have a
Valid driving license she would remain the legal hirer as it is her who signed the agreement and paid”. That is incorrect
because it was me who signed and paid the agreement.

At no point in our conversation Leo or Agostina seemed surprised that someone would spend 4284 GBP on an upgrade
for a rental that costed about 350 GBP which makes it obvious that everybody there is part of a big happy bunch f scammers that is Europcar.
We checked online and there is an overwhelming number of negative reviews, lots of them describing situations similar to ours.
I guess I should consider myself lucky for not damaging the car, because apparently that is Europcar’s main way to overcharge customers.

The question is how can big company like this openly rob so may customers without any actions from the authorities?

I hired a car from Europcar Inverness and reported unlisted damage on the same day I collected the vehicle, within their 24-hour grace period. I physically went to their return hut, pointed out the damage to a staff member, and was told it “didn’t matter” because it didn’t affect the paintwork. No paperwork was amended, and I followed their instructions in good faith.

Weeks later, I’m being charged for that exact damage — the one I clearly reported. Europcar now claims there’s no record of my report, despite it being made in person, and is proceeding with the damage charge anyway.

This feels like a scam, plain and simple. They ignore attempts to follow their own procedures, then turn around and pin the blame on the customer. Disgraceful behaviour from a company that clearly puts profit over honesty."

I was flying from Australia to London Heathrow and decided to hire a car from Europcar during the Doha lay over. I selected the car to be picked up at the airport, filled in all the necessary and selected to pay upfront. The process went through up to my bank where it came back with 'there was an error with your bank' (Scam 1)

I found this odd as there were no issues. I tried a different credit card in case - same response. I tried calling Europcar, no answer. I decided to back myself up by selecting a 2nd rental from SIXT but to pay at the airport. Within seconds I received a SIXT confirmation of booking.

We arrived at Heathrow on Sunday 23rd March at around 5pm and decided to first go to Europcar as we had in the interim received an email stating 'YOUR CAR IS WAITING FOR YOU' (SCAM 2), and we had made a payment and if it had gone through whilst we were in flight, we didn't want to pay twice.
But we couldn't find Europcar. We asked SIXT desk and they said it is a shuttle SERVICE (Scam3). We went back to where the shuttle was supposed to be with 2 trolleys of suitcases. No signage. Went to ask again and told it is lane 3. Pushed the trolleys to lane 3 only to find it was not there. Asked again and directed me back to the first point. We waited 20m for a shuttle and a 20m drive to the EUROPCAR satellite office where there was another wait to be served of 15m. By this time it was now 8pm. I got to the front desk eventually, pulled up my email and the Europcar agent says 'you didn't finish your booking?'. I said I did and showed him the email stating 'your car is waiting'. He said that the booking was not confirmed, and the error message showed that. I asked why if the car wasn't available didn't they show this online and how was a customer to know that an error message for payment meant the vehicle wasn't available? He responded with that he could do the booking manually but there would be a price difference (Scam4). On the app it showed a 30GBP difference between online and at airport booking. We were tired and frustrated so said ok to the difference if it was small. We had booked an Electric JEEP for the week at a cost of 284GBP. The guy came back and said it was now 722GBP. I told him that was unacceptable. He said that due to the fire, all cars were booked out and no other rental company would have a car. It was now nearing 9pm, we had to be at a hotel 2hours drive from Heathrow and I think this is Europcar's plan (Scam 5). We refused to pay the price which was almost 3x that of the original booking and seeing we were not buying this scam, he said he could give a discount and we could get it for 520 GBP. The online at airport booking was 309GBP so he was trying his luck with the higher amounts. We refused and asked them to take us back to the airport.
On arrival I went directly to the SIXT desk, was helped by a fantastic and knowledgeable lady and within 10m we had the car which we had selected, at the price we selected. Europcar you could learn a lot from SIXT.
We are frequent travellers and will NEVER RENT FROM EUROPCAR again as they deliberately show cars online that they use to lure customers and then when the travellers are tired take advantage and try to scam by tripling the cost of the vehicle. You should be ashamed of yourself Europcar."

I booked my rental car at the same time as my easyJet flights. The total rental amount was £91.00, and an additional £50.00 was paid for waiver protection. (Supporting details attached.)

Initial Interaction at Rental Counter
Upon arrival to collect the car, the representative at the counter inquired whether I had rented with Europcar previously. I informed them that I had, but had a negative experience regarding fuel charges, despite refueling the car minutes before returning it. I was forced to raise a complaint and provide proof of my fuel purchase in order to receive a refund. The representative apologized and offered me a free upgrade for my current rental.

Rental Agreement and Holding Deposit
I was presented with the rental agreement, which clearly indicated the prepaid amount of £91.00, as well as an additional charge of £86.90, which was explained to me as a holding deposit. I questioned this charge, and it was reaffirmed as a holding deposit, which would be refunded to my card upon the return of the vehicle. This conversation was witnessed by my colleague, who was traveling with me at the time.

Fuel Refill and Return of Vehicle
Prior to returning the vehicle, I refueled the car with 6.91 liters of petrol, totalling £9.66, at the nearest garage to the airport (PA3 2TH), as per the attached receipt. Upon returning the vehicle, I handed the keys to a Europcar representative named Jack, who inspected the vehicle, including its mileage and fuel levels. He confirmed that everything was in order and that no issues were present.

Unjust Charges
On March 21, 2025, I received an invoice for additional charges, including a Premium Station Surcharge and a charge for 6 liters of fuel. Furthermore, my credit card has been charged an additional £98.85 on top of the original rental charge of £91.00.

These charges are clearly erroneous, unjustified, and appear to be fraudulent.

I hereby request that the excess charge of £98.85 be refunded immediately to my credit card.

Additionally, I wish to file a formal complaint against both the employee who processed my rental and the representative to whom I returned the vehicle. Their actions were misleading and resulted in fraudulent charges being placed against me.

I expect prompt resolution of this matter. Should this issue remain unresolved, I will be forced to take further action to protect my interests."
John McCrone,2025-03-24,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/67deb01ca8574f4c563473a0,"Absolutely useless company.
Staff are incompentent and seem to be computer illiterate.
Not only did they take FIVE FULL days to arrange a replacement car for me, they had just over 2 weeks to prepare, it took me an hour to speak to someone to arrange collection of the car and only then do I find out the car I have, registration given to them, was NOT in my name, Obviously I don't know whose name it's in but the clown I spoke to didn't have it in my name.
Is this why I had to wait 5 days for a car? people can't hand their cars back in quick fashion.
Add to this a dodgy phone call I received regarding the accident the car was in, no not one of those run of the mill scam calls, this one had my name etc, I am now absolutely convinced that Europcar passed my details on to a crappy personal injury place.
Only 3 companies knew the car was in an incident and out of the 3 of them only one is the likely candidate.
Wouldn't use them if I had a choice.
Wish I could give them zero they don't deserve 1 star.

24/03/2025 this is my response to them replying to my review. I had already contacted your company and got a hollow worthless response from that, so no I won't be contacting you again. I've now had the car 2 days beyond me trying to return it and no idea if they'll actually coming today. I'd wager the depot that is supposed to collect it knows nothing about it as your customer service clowns are worthless and when I was on call it sounded like they were struggling to use their computers.
again, I will never use Europcar by choice."
Tunny Park,2025-03-21,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/67dda318388ba912c9fd751f,"I hired a car from Inverness Airport on 18/3/25. I returned it a few hours later having done 42 miles and having filled the tank up to the very brim with £8 of fuel just before drop off. I couldn’t get any more fuel in the tank. They hold £250 from your account to cover any additional costs. Just got my money back but with £10 deducted for fuel! If true this car used £18 of fuel to cover 42 miles. This is a SCAM. I made the guy at the Europcar check the car over with me which was a bit of a walk. The guy was very unhappy, wanting me just to leave the car for him to check later, but came with me. He checked the car inside and out (checking mileage and fuel) and told me everything was OK and that I’d get my full deposit back ‘soon’. When you leave a hire car you are at the mercy of the integrity of these hire companies. Europcar clearly has little of that. I made a complaint and will include the result of that later. However it might be something like:

“Hello John,
We appreciate your feedback and we are sorry to learn you were dissatisfied with our service.
Give us the chance to solve the issue by providing more details using (link removed) where our customer service team will be in touch.
We hope to see you again.

I booked through Discovery Cars who apparently use a company called Keddy who are run by Europcar.
After quite a trek to find the rental cars at South Terminal it was there I discovered my car had been booked through Europcar.
Somehow during the process and my very stressed self having lost my passport lots of extras were added to my rental without telling me or advising me there as I signed the paperwork. Even when I questioned the girl about the extra £409 she said she didn’t know how much the rental was but there was a refundable deposit.
After returning the car £409 was taken from my bank account with no warning and it appears the £78 on my original booking was none existent thank to the added extras I was not told about.
When I rang to complain they laughed at me.
A very poor service and left me feeling I’d
been scammed.

Alfredo Esposito,2025-03-04,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/67c6f76f0bb87eab220bda57,"Europcar at London Stansted is running a scam to fraudulently charge customers for extras they explicitly refuse. I clearly stated FIVE times that I did not want the premium cover, yet they added it anyway without my consent.

The agent, Fred, even lied to my face, telling me the extra charge was just the rental deposit—when in reality, it was the premium cover I had rejected. Later, he even called me for feedback, completely unaware that he had charged me for the cover! This proves that Europcar is either incompetent or deliberately deceiving customers to steal their money.

When I complained, Europcar’s customer service dismissed my case, simply stating that I had signed the contract—completely ignoring the fact that I was misled and scammed into doing so. This is outright fraud.

I will be reporting Europcar to UK Trading Standards, disputing the charge with my credit card provider, and will continue leaving reviews until this issue is resolved. Avoid Europcar at all costs unless you want to be scammed!"
HATEM BADR,2025-03-04,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/67c6d58580de5e2c632f265e,"I had an extremely frustrating experience with Europcar UK due to unjust charges and a lack of accountability.

First, I was charged over £100 for roadside assistance, which was never properly explained at the rental desk as a daily fee instead of a one-time charge. Had this been made clear, I would have declined or opted for full insurance, which would have been a far better choice. Instead, I was rushed into signing multiple documents without any real explanation.

Even worse, I was charged over £200 for a faulty tyre that developed a bubble after just 215 miles over 8 days—something that shouldn’t happen with a properly maintained vehicle. This raises serious concerns about Europcar’s safety standards. It seems that Europcar relies on renters purchasing insurance to cover defective or substandard parts, knowing they can shift the cost to insurance companies rather than ensuring vehicles are well-maintained. Those who decline extra coverage are left footing the bill for Europcar’s own negligence.

Hoping for fair treatment, I escalated this to BVRLA, expecting them to step in. But rather than questioning Europcar’s practice of shifting costs onto customers, BVRLA chose to focus only on Europcar’s paperwork, avoiding any real attempt to hold them accountable. This approach allows Europcar to continue misleading and overcharging customers without consequences.

Renters deserve better—clear terms, properly maintained vehicles, and fair business practices. Not hidden charges, misleading explanations, and financial penalties for defects that aren’t their fault."
Robert Chihade,2025-03-03,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/67c5e5b765ad0b880c3d2fb6,"Europcar LCY very much operates a fraud scheme here as they charge customers for ""damage"" that is non existent or that they claim is the customer's fault.

In my case, I received emails after my rental that there was “damage” to the car. Photos were provided, but I am unable to see any damage in the photos. I have attached a photo they sent, apparently there is a scratch on the front bumper but I do not see one, especially at the resolution provided. Not to mentioning claiming ""damage"" on a bumper - a bumper! - just screams scam.

I was not asked to inspect the vehicle prior to the rental. I was not given any evidence of the condition of the car prior to the rental. (However, the pickup attendant tried to upsell me to cars that were 8x and 6x more expensive than my rental.)

Upon return (to London City), the attendant required me to drive to a remote part of the parking lot for the return - far from the Europcar office and designated return area, with no other cars around, and extremely far from the terminal. I now know why - to be out of view in order to execute a damages claim scam.

The car was only driven 4 times during the rental, and did not impact anything during those 4 trips.

Claiming that I am responsible for damages is scam-like, inefficient, inappropriate, and terrible customer service. When I stated so to the claims rep, they claimed I should've read the 49-page Terms and Conditions prior to the rental.

Highly advise renting elsewhere."

I bought a CD waver insurance policy which I showed at the desk on collection of the car. I had to use my debit card instead of a credit card as the PIN had been changed by my wife. Apparently using my debit card meant that I had to take compulsory and very expensive CD insurance that increased the cost by 112 euros. This was not exp[lained to me at the desk. On return I was invoiced for this extra amount and emailed their support. This was answered that I had signed the agreement when renting so nothing could be done. My point is that I cannot read the full agreements when renting a car especially when stressed to get to my final destination and with a queue behind me. I had bought a policy to cover the excess so clearly did not want or need extra insurance. I think that Europcar should have refunded this charge but they stopped replying to my follow up emails.

Got cheap car rental through Booking.com for Europcar. Even paid an additional amount on the booking for full insurance for a 7 day hire.

Arrived at Fuerteventura airport and was told that the full insurance wasn’t any good as it was taken through a third party. They sold me the full insurance for €285 on top of what I had already paid!!!!! This ensured that any damage would be waived.

Picked up the car and noticed a few marks on it - I wasnt bothered as I had full cover.

Returned the car after 7 days, and with no damage to it. They scoured the car and told me I’d damaged the rear of the car (I hadn’t). Luckily I’d taken out their rip off insurance, so I could walk away worry free.

Adrian Derucki,2025-02-20,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/67b6fbcffbee5b9e41233be3,"I recently rented a vehicle from Europcar on 02/02/2025, and my experience has been extremely disappointing. The rental process was smooth, and I returned the vehicle in perfect condition, with no damage whatsoever. Europcar even refunded my deposit, confirming there were no issues at the time of return.

However, 18 days later, I received an email claiming that I had caused a 5-15 cm scuff on the front bumper. This accusation is completely false. I drove carefully, parked safely, and at no point was the bumper exposed to any situation that could have caused such damage.

I immediately disputed the claim and requested proof, including time-stamped photos and inspection reports. So far, Europcar has not provided clear evidence that the damage occurred while the vehicle was in my possession. Given the time delay, I strongly suspect the damage happened after my rental and that Europcar is unfairly holding me responsible.

This experience has been frustrating, and I now see many similar complaints from other customers. It feels like a deliberate scam to extract extra money from customers long after their rental has ended. Beware! Always take detailed photos and videos before and after your rental to protect yourself.

I would strongly advise against renting from Europcar unless you want to risk being charged for damages you didn’t cause."

I had a deeply disappointing experience with Europcar UK during my recent car rental. I booked a car for my family trip from 20th December 2024 to 20th January 2025 and paid in full (GBP 1,639.81) upfront. However, the problems began as soon as I arrived at the Gatwick Airport North Terminal after a 30-hour flight from Brisbane.

Despite explicitly informing the staff that I did not require additional insurance because I have Allianz Travel Insurance covering rental car excess, I was handed a document to sign under the pretense of providing a security deposit. Later, I discovered it was a completely new rental agreement with added charges for unwanted insurance and a so-called ""free upgrade"" to a Peugeot PG5008. The upgrade was presented as complimentary because the originally booked MG HS was unavailable, yet I was later charged for it.

Upon returning the car at Heathrow Airport, I was unexpectedly charged GBP 20 for cleaning without prior disclosure. The staff claimed it was because the car floor required more than five minutes to clean. This charge was never mentioned in the rental agreement.

After returning to Australia, I discovered an unauthorized charge of AUD 3,889.19 on my credit card, labeled as a second rental payment. I immediately contacted Europcar but received only an automated response. Despite multiple follow-ups, I was given no proper explanation or resolution.

To make matters worse, I noticed additional unexplained charges of GBP 45 each on 12th and 13th February 2025. Again, these charges were processed without my consent and with no justification provided.

This experience has highlighted Europcar's lack of transparency, misleading practices, and poor customer service. I strongly advise others to avoid Europcar if they want a stress-free and honest rental experience."

Short story.
On pick up they offered their insurance that would double the rental price and I refused. They bought the car outside and I asked for the existing damages report on the car that I was not provided with and I’ve been told that they are aware of all damages and I will not get charged for them. I took a video of the car in many angles that saved me probably paying over 1000£ in damages fees.
On drop off the guy looked around the car for 1 minute the came to me and said that everything is ok and I will receive my deposit back in 4-5 days, I left and then the scammer went back to the car took photos of 2 scratches and added them to the drop off report and said that they were new ones. I never found out until one week later when I received an email from europcar with the claim against me for 2 scratches on the car. I asked for the drop off report and I couldn’t believe when I saw the pictures of the scratches in the drop off report.

Matt,2025-01-21,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/678fc4a0a09dd0dbd0a16458,"Was falsely charged two fees; one for a delay returning the car which was caused by Europcar taking TWO hours to return a call for extending the rental - a call that they said would be ""within 15 minutes"". Then they added on an extra day rental for 53 minutes late return when it was due to their own delay in calling me.

I suspect the delay in call back was in order to force the delay and make the extra charge. Very suspicious.

They then refused to remove that price with a customer service agent who presumably was provided by Little Britain.

In addition, there was a hidden charge for a ""premium"" drop-off location, which was not in the original agreement or detailed at collection.

I'll soon to be making my feelings clear to over five million users on social media.

Avoid this misleading, fraudulent company which does not value customers and would rather charge for a 53-minute delay in which THEY caused.

You should, though, perhaps also feel bad for Europcar because they are so desperate for money they insist on charging £25 incorrectly than settle this issue.

Updated in response to your comment below: I had raised it on email already and it remains unresolved. You informed me to go speak to EasyCar about the additional driver charge, which indicates your guy had no authority to do what he did and say 'how about we waive the additional driver charge and use that to top up the insurance instead'. Complete scam, I have contacted the bank re unauthorsied charges on my CC. You shouldn't be allowed to operate like this. It's theft.

I agreed, signed the form and returned the car full of petrol by 1pm Saturday. I then received notification from my bank that I'd been charged two days using an automatic, plus two days insurance. I called Europcar customer service to complain. They told me as I signed the contract there was nothing they could do. Plus they refused to put me through to the Victoria branch manager or put me through to their senior manager to raise the complaint. Incensed, I then went to the Victoria Europcar shop to explain to the manager the booking error. He wasn't there. I went again and again and again, three times he still wasn't there. These three times I explained to the Victoria staff in the manager's absence the mishap that had happened. Each time the staff I spoke to told me they'd get the manager to call me to sort out the mis-booking. The manager never called me. The fourth time I arrived at the Victoria branch, the manager was finally there, but kept me waiting 1/2hr before he turned up to talk to me. He looked surprised at my appearance and said he'd heard nothing about my complaint from any of his staff or customer services. The staff member behind me, who I'd met the day before and who'd promised to pass on my message, put his head in his hands. We knew perfectly well the manager was lying. He then told me I was lying and had made this whole thing up. He said he never offered me a free upgrade to an automatic from a manual car. He added, as I'd signed the contract my complaint meant nothing. But the contract I signed was misleading. The sum for £164 was black bold with lots of small type around it. This amount sounded about right for a 2 day manual hire including insurance I'd agreed to add on to the initial £115 fee. Not the £320 that was actually deducted from my bank account for a two day automatic hire. The manager walked off dismissing me. I called Europcar customer service again to complain. Three times the Europcar customer service put the phone down on me. I can't tell you how unjust, dishonest, disgraceful and unsettling this experience has been. I will never hire a Europcar EVER again."

What did we rent?
My mom and I rented a Fiat 500 via a trusted German website costing us exactly EUR 175. Insurance and everything is covered by the broker. We just wanted to pick up our rental.

What happened?
At the Europcar counter we were greeted by Euan (or Ewan). He seemed like one chirpy Scotsman. To our delight he upgraded us ""free of charge"". What an amazing guy! We couldn't believe our luck. He said, ""you definitely need something bigger where you are headed and I have just the car"".

There was no mention of additional costs whatsoever.
Who wouldn't like a free upgrade when they're headed into the Scottish outback?

Some papers were elegantly shuffled around, we were told to sign here, here and here. After that we had to pop our card into the machine for the deposit and it was a done deal. Only it wasn't.

The trickery and the damage.
The upgrade was not free of charge and the additional cost of the rental was £171.86 or EUR 205. EXTRA! That's more than the initial rental booking. Both numbers look extremely similar by the way. When we inserted our card for the deposit, we in fact paid for the upgrade. That was NEVER mentioned to us. We also never paid for a deposit, which is utterly bizarre. The kicker is that we didn't receive an end of rental statement either. Also, the charge for the upgrade was not taken out until 2 weeks after the rental (06/11/24). So even if we had paid with Monzo, which shows charges instantly we would not have realised it then and there at the counter.

Of course we signed the papers and that's enough for Europcar. Why would they care? Their golden boy Euan is ripping off people by the planeloads making the rental car company a F-ton of extra money. Unfortunately our broker nor our bank couldn't help, but that's not the end of it. A quick Google search reveals that this isn't Euan's first con nor that Europcar will ever see the promised land.

BEWARE: Euan is a smirking bastard who is out to get you. Be it extra insurance you don't need or ""free"" upgrades.

PLEASE read what you sign.

FURTHER ACTION will be taken via BVRLA.

If you read this and were scammed as well please take action. Do not let them get away with this. We will create a case and if necessary hire a lawyer collectively. Please get in touch.

I always book a rental car via a German trustworthy platform to find the best deal with the best reviews to avoid scams.
We had a small car reserved but Euan at Glasgow Airport gave us a larger car without even mentioning extra costs! The writing on the rental agreement was so bad and resembled the amount in Euros I prepaid but was in fact the extra amount for the upgrade in GBP! Instead of 172.15 Euros, we paid £172 extra for the unsolicited upgrade. He shuffled the papers in front of us, no detailed explanation and we signed. I usually read every single line on these contracts but he had a talent to charm and con us into it.
When I entered the card into the card pay machine, I assumed it is for the deposit. We were not given any receipt for any transaction at any time, again, thinking it is for the deposit.
In the Europcar yard I realised that there were no small cars parked anywhere and again assumed that we got a larger one because they didn't have a small car available.
Only when I checked my bank account when we were back from Scotland, I realised that we got charged for the upgrade on top of the initial payment! A deposit was never taken out of the account. The fact that the money was only taken out of my account 2 weeks after the rental also shows that nothing was done by the book. If I had seen the amount on a receipt or in my transactions straight away, we could have turned on our heels. But if you get deceived in such a way, you don't expect bad intention. We also never received an end of rental statement via email as it usually is the case.
I filed two complaints with Check24, the German booking website, however, they closed the case twice after trying to solve the issue with Europcar.
This is not where it ends, Europcar. I'm taking this to the BVLRA for further investigation. It can't be the case that so many people get scammed by Europcar and get away with it.
And if you, Europcar, send an automated reply to this rating and how sorry you are about the experience, then do something about the scammers you employ at your rental desks.
This has to end!"

Use another company who is honest or takes scamming complaints seriously. Edit* Company have refused to refund or investigate. Have complained to the BVLRA"
Gerson Duarte,2025-01-04,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/67798e3f2ad12d49c6bbe1fe,"On Friday the 20th December of 2024 I booked a rental vehicle through the Easyjet website, collecting it from Europcar Manchester Airport at 3:00pm.

From the innumerous companies based in Manchester, I chose Europcar as it is a well-reputed company in the market, trustworthy and with relatively affordable prices.
According to the booking summary I did not contract any other services or extra options in addition to the car rental.

When collecting the vehicle the employee present at the time suggested me to upgrade my cover to a premium insurance, to which I said I was not interested.

Upon my answer, your employee gave me several documents to sign under the excuse they were mandatory to the conclusion of the rental contract.

The car was returned with a full tank, without any faults or damage, something that was checked by your staff at the time of delivery.

I was completely gobsmacked and furious when I received the invoice where you Europcar charged me almost double the amount that had been previously agreed.

I will bring again to your attention that I did not contract or subscribed to any extra services, neither at the time of booking nor at the time of collection.

After reading SEVERAL feedbacks from other dissatisfied customers on several internet pages, I can finally understand where the issue relies:
Because I refused the premium insurance, the employee took advantage of my apparent rush to collect the car keys and the fact that I was a foreigner and non English native, to give me the premium insurance contract to sign mixed up with other paperwork.

This is fraud, and you are accountable for it.

Unfortunately this situation, which is very difficult to prove, seems to be recurring and many customers were scammed in this way (you can find plenty similar cases here in Google Feedback, for example).

That said, my only question is:
Are your employees who, in search of commission money, deceive Europcar customers?
Or is Europcar the one encouraging employees to carry out this type of fraudulent scheme?
Until what extend are you as a company involved in this fraudulent scheme?

Either options are despicable and reprehensible.
Considering Europcar has been operating since 1949 and has a reputation to uphold, you should be ashamed of your employees actions and take responsibility for their misdeeds.

I expect nothing than a full refund covering the extra money that was abusively withdrawn from my account, and for the employees who have been carrying such fraud to be sanctioned and brought to justice.

I expect an answer from you within the next 15 days, and in the case of failure I will seek further action with legal authorities.
I will also report this matter to the GOV.UK, Trading Standards Institute and to the ECRCS.

You can fool me once, but you won't fool twice. As someone who travels to England twice a year, I will never use your services again, and I will make sure this situation is widely spread."
Emily Berry,2025-01-03,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/67779ff6dc29bef30f2a6837,"Terrible experience - Europcar need to urgently update their t’s&c’s.

There is an undisclosed young drivers fee - the terms and conditions states “Under 25’s will face a young drivers fee”, which is the main reason why I booked the car with europcar, as I am 25 and this statement means I will not be charged any extra.

Unfortunately I was faced with an extra £590 fee for my car on arrival, when the car booking itself was only £390. The first line you see on the t’s and c’s is the above (quote - UNDER 25’s), and you have to “click to read more” to read further where you see the line, “25’s AND under will be charged” etc. Why would I click to read further if the first, summarised thing I read clearly states it is relevant for UNDER 25’s, not 25 AND under?

To add to this, the fee wasn’t added until I arrived to collect, so I also could not cancel my car. I was within the 6 hour pick up time and so I would have been charged the full fair. I was left with no option but to take the charge, all because of an error on their side. My £390 car turned into a £980 one!! Absolute rip off.

I feel I am entitled to a refund on this surcharge fee, and I would certainly not suggest Europcar to anyone."

It stated that I could leave a deposit instead of using a credit card. However, upon arrival at Goldcar Portugal, I was informed that they do not accept deposits under any circumstances. This was the first misleading claim.
Additionally, the voucher indicated that renting a device for automatic payment on highway tolls was optional. Again, this was false. According to the staff at the Goldcar counter, the toll payment device is mandatory, not optional as stated in the voucher.
Due to these inaccuracies and misleading representations on Europcar’s voucher, I was unable to use the service as it would have incurred significantly higher costs than initially quoted.
I wrote an email complaint to Europcar, clearly outlining how the service they sold me was misrepresented and requesting a refund. After an unacceptable delay of eight weeks, I received a dismissive, generic response that completely ignored the reason of my complaint, simply stating that no refund would be issued because the voucher was not used. This completely missed the issue: I did not use the voucher because of the false terms Europcar provided.
I responded to this inadequate reply, requesting a proper analysis of my complaint. Four months have now passed, and I have yet to receive any follow-up or resolution.

Having no other choice, I accepted an extra total charge of £30. He rushed me to sign the so called standard form and directed me to take the car as there was another client behind me.

=====
I recently rented a car from Europcar at Manchester Airport through Trip.com. Upon arrival, I was offered a “free upgrade.” Tired after a 19-hour flight and being unfamiliar with the detailed terms, I trusted the salesperson’s assurances and signed the agreement. To my shock, I later discovered I was charged £847, including fees for services and upgrades I was never informed about.

These charges were not transparently explained during the transaction. While I acknowledge my signature, I believe this was obtained under misleading circumstances. The salesperson’s failure to disclose critical information left me feeling taken advantage of.

I reached out to Trip.com to dispute these charges, but the resolution was unsatisfactory. Despite presenting my case, the charges remain, with no acknowledgment of their lack of transparency.

Unfortunately, I am not alone. After my experience, I found several similar complaints about Europcar’s unclear practices, such as:

TripAdvisor Review of Europcar Heathrow -
1. “Scam Upgrade from Europcar!!”
2. ""Scammed for Extras fees""
3. ""Reddit Post on Europcar Issues - Europcar Heathrow Rental Scam""

My intent in sharing this review is to warn future customers. If you choose Europcar, I strongly recommend documenting every interaction, asking for detailed explanations of all fees, and carefully reviewing the agreement before signing. Transparency and trust are essential, and unfortunately, my experience with Europcar fell far short of this standard."

Was given a guaranteed on line booking price inclusive of VAT. Collected the car and made no changes. On return to the UK i was charged an additional £450 and VAT. On questioning this i was advised a GUARANTEED PRICE changes to an approximate price when you sign for the vehicle -
No explanation as to why
Wasn't warned of this and would say that's rather misleading.

Being prior warned I took photographs of the fuel tank prior to filling on filling and return Admittedly i drove 35k in a Hybrid to drop off Brindisi airport.
Was told i had to replace the fuel for the 35km used.
I refused the traffic was bad and i didn't have time.
My final bill stated the vehicle was 2/8 empty & was charged for refueling at Eur22 plus 11Lts of fuel - in a Hybrid ??? amazing

Simon,2024-11-03,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/6723c0e82ddd1118b4f0173d,"When we picked up the car we said we did not want any extra insurance etc - we did pay for an extra driver. I was asked to sign the form about additional extras, and noticed there was a charge on it of 3 pounds per day - I asked what that was, and was told it was VAT on the extra driver. I foolishly signed - only to see later it was for something I had not requested (emergency travel service - no idea what that is). The staff member had not printed his name on the form (as required) but did sign to say he had explained the extra product to me - he never mentioned it! I contacted Europcar by email the next day (phoning was not getting me anywhere) and informed them of this. They replied saying leave it until you return the car. At the car return they said we cannot help but contact head office again and you will get a refund. In the end they said I had signed and they could not check what was said, so the money was gone - even though I had contacted them the day after to inform them I did not want this (on a 7 day rental).
I have the impression Europcar UK staff are encouraged, or at least permitted, to mislead customers and charge extra - and they well get bonuses for this. Not trustworthy at all!

Europcar responded by suggesting that I give them ""a chance to solve the issue"" by contacting their customer service. This is their standard response and sounds good - except I have already exchanged several emails with their customer service dept - they started off offering to help, but in the end said they would not refund the money wrongly charged. I do not expect more correspondence will change that. It was not really a very good service for customers."

When I went to pick car up from Glasgow Airport branch I was scammed from the minute I walked through the door. The young chap with a beard didn't even want to see my car hire voucher as he said he had it on his computer. Asked what car I drove normally I said an automatic as I have rhymathoid arthritis but for a week I would only need a manual which I had booked. Told me he would give me an automatic at no extra cost as I had a disability also said my daughter could be an additional driver in case I wasn't able to drive while I was visiting family. I did sign a form after he said it was a holding deposit which would all be returned after I dropped car off( they took £903 out my account). He folded up paper and put into envelope I made a point in say you haven't charged me any extra have you as my reading eyesight isn't good. Reply not at all madam. Enjoy your stay, dropped car off flowing Monday 14th Oct . Next day I found out they had taken out £653 out of my account for upgrade, young driver addition my daughter is 25. I have complained and told that because I signed it's my fault. They have scammed me out of this money by playing on my disability and poor reading eyesight. So I have just paid £900 for a hire car for a week which is absolutely terrifying. I could have got taxis everywhere cheaper than this. It is shocking what people are prepared to do to vulnerable people who are honest and hardworking. Glasgow branch seems to be good at doing this. I will never use or recommend them ever again. If I don't get my money back I will contact watchdog and the ombudsman. Playing on someone's disability is shocking. If I could I would give them zero stars"

Their business standards - upselling, bundling, threatening, misleading on our example:
1. Refusal to release the vehicle in accordance with the reservation & voucher
2. Trying to sell a more expensive vehicle rental service
3. If you insist on what you ordered, they will start scaring you and add additional costs for insurance, location, service and something else...

Really poor communication when trying to resolve it and lots of hidden extra charges. The worst of big corporate company behaviour taking advantage of the average customer. Avoid at all costs.

I very much doubt it will be repaired they just take the money. It really feels like I've been scammed. After over a month of emails in which all of their responses were callous and didn't answer my very polite questions, after already extorting 1500 euros, they are still taking more money from my credit card and I'm having to go to the ombudsman just to stop them after trying with the company for over a month. The ombudsman, the ECRCS, found they had mistakenly charged me VAT on the damage - Europcar then took another £1100 from my credit card without refunding me the first charge of £1382. Honestly I didn't find the ombudsman helpful, it felt like they were sponsored by the care hire company.

I picked up a car a few minutes before the agreed time which they accommodated. We returned the car 20mins after our contracted drop off time and at the time we were told there’s no issue. However a few days later I got an unrecognised charge from them which they didn’t communicate upfront. Only when I queried it I found out they’ve charged me for an extra day which was surprising considering I’ve stayed within the contractual agreement. In essence they’ll go against what’s stated in the contract to get more money out of you."

Charity Today - Office,2024-10-15,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/670e4b62d657eb6a45574c11,"We recently had an incredibly frustrating experience with Europcar, and I cannot express enough how disappointing their service has been. We booked a vehicle online for an important event – our Charity Awards – and provided all the necessary personal details. They had no issue taking our money and conducting an online check. However, after travelling for miles to collect the vehicle, we were told that our investigative journalist could not take the van because he wasn't on the electoral roll.

Why on earth would they allow us to proceed with the booking, travel such a long distance, only to turn us away upon arrival? It wasted an entire day, time we didn’t have to spare, all for nothing. Now, we’re left waiting for a refund that has taken days to process, with no van, no solution, and a serious disruption to our event plans.

My biggest regret was not checking the reviews on here first! Had I seen the experiences others have had, we would never have booked with Europcar in the first place. Thankfully, a local company stepped in last minute to save the day, but the way Europcar handled this situation was absolutely shocking. The lack of communication and care is beyond frustrating. I strongly urge anyone considering renting from Europcar to think again. Don’t waste your time, energy, or money – their service is abysmal!

And Europcar, don’t come at us with the generic response of “we’ll look into this for you” – whatever you are doing is a scam, if not of people's money, their valuable time!"
Craig Doughty,2024-10-12,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/6709f5880f149d615148308e,"Note: Europcar is writing fake five-star reviews to offset all of the negative reviews it is receiving.

My experience...

Save yourself the time and stress: take the rental you plan to give to Europcar, set aside around £20, douse the rest in gasoline, and set it alight. Use the £20 for public transport instead.

I was foolish enough to rent a vehicle from them. I now realise this is not a reputable company but rather a rolling scam—a front for financial abuse masked as fair policy. Whatever you pay in advance, regardless of the booking mediator you use, rest assured, it won’t be the final price. The car you want won’t be available, the cover you obtain through a booking mediator will be ignored, and you’ll be charged for additional coverage (even if you insist you’re already covered).

Effectively, here’s what will happen: you’ll arrive to collect the car you booked. Europcar won’t have it. They’ll offer you a shed on wheels and claim it’s similar to what you reserved. It won’t be. They will then offer an upgrade at an exorbitant rate, trapping you because you need a car to make your holiday work. Then, they’ll place a temporary hold on your card, and for weeks after returning the car, they’ll bombard you with invoices for additional costs at inflated prices.

Europcar is about as transparent as sandblasted glass covered in treacle."

S. Z,2024-10-07,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/6704585562752a1166b3d2ee,"Please beware! Paid £1,400 for a £580 Europcar Rental: Misleading Deposits and Hidden Insurance Costs

I initially booked a 2-week rental for what seemed like a great price—£237 in total. The pick-up process went smoothly, and I was asked to pay a “deposit,” which I was told would be refunded if the car was returned intact. However, at no point did the staff mention any additional costs beyond what I had already paid online.

Fast forward to the end of the two weeks—I needed to extend my rental, but it wasn’t possible. No big deal; I returned the car and booked another one for £343. This time, I noticed that they had sneakily added a £30 per day insurance premium. To my shock, this same hidden charge had been applied to my first rental as well, even though it was never communicated to me.

Now, here’s the real kicker: the so-called “deposit” isn’t a deposit at all! They cleverly call it that to make you think you’ll get the full amount back, but in reality, they deduct the insurance charges from it. It’s a deliberate tactic to keep the insurance cost as hidden as possible until it’s too late.

When I asked if I could opt out of the insurance, they refused to give me a car and would not refund the £300+ I had already paid. In the end, what was meant to be a straightforward car rental turned into a financial nightmare. For four weeks of car rental, I spent £580 on the online booking, plus an outrageous £800+ on insurance, bringing the total to nearly £1,400.

It’s clear that Europcar’s strategy is to lure customers with attractive online rates, and then, after you’ve paid the non-refundable fee, hit you with surprise insurance charges—last minute—leaving you with no choice but to accept. If insurance is mandatory, why isn’t it included in the advertised price so that customers can make an informed decision? This is blatant false advertising.

Europcar has lost me as a customer forever, and I strongly advise anyone to steer clear of this company. In all fairness, the cars themselves are clean and good, but their deceptive, scheming practices make for a truly awful experience."
Barry Smith,2024-10-06,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/6702678f70689719860ec2ca,"I picked up my car from Gatwick airport.

The young lad was helpful but immediately went off and returned with two Mercedes keys and told me I could have them instead at a discount. I told him that I wanted the car I had ordered but with the basic insurance. In the end that car wasn’t available so I had a free upgrade. So far so good.
I repeated about my basic insurance requirements. He then went through the costs. I told him I didn’t want roadside assistance but he told me that was part of the package. I should have questioned him further on the package but he was nice and helpful so I signed the contract. Later when I read it closely I realised I had paid for premium insurance. I have now complained but have been told I have to wait until the hire has finished before I can complain. I now have the feeling the whole thing is a well rehearsed con to get the client to pay for higher insurance. Reassure the customer you have his best interests, focus on the free upgrade, gloss over questions on insurance and then stick him with premium cover. No doubt I will get no rebate later when I complain again.
Bottom line is to be very suspicious. If you suspect they are trying to cheat you they probably are."

I hope that others read the reviews before booking with Europcar Gatwick. I have rented cars for over 45 years and have NEVER been scammed like this.

On arrival the woman at the desk tried to make me upgrade the car - making it appear that that was the one l been allocated (she already had the key on the desk infront of her). I refused and said l wanted the car l had booked.

Next, premium insurance was added to my contract without asking me. As a result, l paid 150% more on my originally booking price. I have annual excess insurance and never use the rental company insurance went l rent.

They hid the fact that insurance was added by including it in the credit card excess authisation. Therefore, you are unaware that you have purchased insurance until your card is charged after the rental. Look at the reviews, many others have been scammed in this way.

When I asked if the car had any damaged, l was told that it wasn't necessary to check it. On return, it was a different story, with the attendant checking the car minutely - going around it several times. In the end he found a very small scratch and l was required to sign off on the damage. I cannot say if the damage was already done when l rented the car. The scratch was so small l do not believe l would have noticed it ... and certainly not in poor light conditions.

If you use this company you should make sure that you photograph the whole car, including wheels, before you drive off.

I rented a car at London Gatwick Airport after booking the car and purchasing a ""Premium"" insurance policy online with e-Dreams. At the airport counter, the agent informed me that since I already had insurance with full coverage, I did not need to subscribe to any additional insurance. I was also told that a deposit of 700 euros would be charged (something I was already aware of through the contract signed with e-Dreams). In good faith, I signed the required forms on the tablet (the amount indicated was £647, which I believed to be the deposit) and was given a document with the rental and payment details; nothing else was handed to me, nor sent via email (certainly not an insurance policy that might have raised some suspicions).
After two months of waiting for the refund of what I thought was the deposit, I was informed, upon my inquiry, that no refund would be issued as the amount charged corresponded to the cost of the insurance I had supposedly subscribed to. Realizing I had signed a document without verifying that the amount (which was not specified) actually consisted of £100 for the deposit and £546 for the insurance policy (this was the final amount charged), I nonetheless filed a complaint with customer service. Their prompt response (only 21 minutes after my email!) stated that since it was impossible to verify what had been discussed verbally, only the signed document held any validity!

BEWARE!!!! BEWARE!!!! You have been warned. Horrible experience with EuropCar UK. I rented a car through Booking.com. When we arrived, they told us they didn’t have the car that we requested/paid for prior and they were going to upgrade us. They upgraded all right. On top of the $700 we already paid through booking.com they charged another $1200. They told me the initial $700 was included in the $1200 so I only had a $500 upcharge. I asked why there was any upcharge since they did not have the car I booked. I was told because I reserved the car through booking .com and not through them it would not be a free upgrade that I could go back to booking.com and request a different car or upgrade to this one at a cost. I am standing at the airport with 4 other people and didn’t have many options at the moment so we elected to pay the difference for the upgrade. Little did I know they charge me $1200 on top of the initial $700 I had already paid. I was not aware of this until AFTER my trip. Now that the car was dropped off they charged me another $400 to replace a tire because there was a minor cut in the side of the tire. This is the same tire that had previous damage noted on the rental contract. Where the cut was and the size of it you could not see it depending how the car is parked. When I returned it the cut was in the 1:00 o’clock position on the tire and easily visible. If the car is parked with the tire between 4:00 – 8:00 o’clock position you can not see the defect. At any rate I was charged $400 to replace the tire that only had about 60% remaining tread left on the tire. All in all it was a horrible experience with them and I will never use them again.

Response from Customer Service
Thank you for contacting Europcar Customer Services.

I can confirm the rental station will offer additional optional products to our customers upon their arrival at the desk, to ensure they are aware of all the products and services available. It is then the customer’s decision to accept or decline the products offered to them.

Whilst I appreciate you have stated that the upgrade charge was not agreed to, I would be unable to comment further as I was not part of the verbal discussion. When the two parties involved are providing conflicting information, I can only base my decision by the documented evidence available.

As the rental agreement and Additional Optional Products form have been signed, in acceptance of the product, the request for the charge to be refunded has been respectfully declined.

Then finally they confirm that those 52 pounds are related to an upgraded added at the counter and that at the time of the pickup, there was added a ""Roadside Assistance Express.""

At this moment I also realize that the agent basically did this intentionally because I didn't buy the full coverage insurance at the counter. I told the agent that I had my own private insurance and he stated that the private insurances from booking.com don't cover glass and wheels. I told him that it was an insurance with my bank and that it has full coverage, so it seems like in that moment he decided to add the Roadside Assistance Express and didn't me anything that this was an upgrade and that I had to pay £52.38 extra for it.
If he would have done that, obviously I would have say no because I have full private coverage insurance already for this.

What did the agent do? He just told me to sign the Rental agreement in multiple corners of the paper on both sides and that's it. And then told me to put my credit card for the deposit. He also didn't mention the value of the total deposit and didn't say that he was charging me £700 for the non-insurance deposit and £52.38 for the Roadside Assistance Express. At that moment I would have also asked by there were 2 payments and I would have cancel it.

This is a very old school mislead sales tactic that should be claimed, but the customer service hasn't helped me further because I signed the agreement. The agent also signed the paper, but he didn't put his name, so I'm still waiting for a response from customer service to know the name of the agent who did this and file an official claim. What a terrible and disappointing experience."

Christopher Alcroft,2024-09-04,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/66d8be82ff61d5fa93ecf976,"I hired a car from Europcar (Volvo XC60) on a recent trip to Nice. I booked the rental through a 3rd party comparison site and paid a deposit for the rental and was covered for some extras, such as environmental surcharge. On arrival at the rental centre we were in a queue for about an hour and when we got to the desk was greeted by a very pushy rep. The cost of the rental was not as per the original agreement and they had added on the additional environmental charge. The salesperson also tried to ""upsell"" me a Mercedes and additional insurance, which I declined, at which point his demeanor became more aggressive. I was also miss-sold a full tank of fuel on the understanding that I would only be charged for fuel I used. They also charged me over £400 for a tiny scratch on the bottom of the rear bumper which I must have missed on the initial inspection, however I do have insurance cover for this. Their business model is clearly to misrepresent the original displayed price and then aggressively sell or even miss-sell add-ons and I strongly suspect their staff are targeted and compensated based on these sales. I will never be renting from Europcar again and would urge others to think twice before using their services."

I arrived in Belfast airport early morning to pick up a rental car I had paid for in advance. The lady behind the desk was lovely with good chat. I was offered a complementary upgrade - I thought wow this was nice, this proved a fallacy as a couple of days after I had returned the keys, I was charged on my credit card out of the deposit. Having looked after the car and taken photos of the condition when I handed it in, I assumed I had been charged for some perceived scratch and was about to argue. When I enquired I found out the charge was for the upgrade which I had assumed was complementary/free.

The way I was charged was misleading and deceptive since I was not charged on the day I picked up the vehicle and accepted the 'complementary upgrade' and therefore did not receive a paper receipt from the sales point terminal. I signed what I thought was a contract for renting of the car, I had no idea there were extra charges for the upgrade, the charge was in font 6 and not easy to interpret especially arriving early morning bleary eyed.

I took the smallest/budget car as this was what I could afford and would have not taken the upgrade if it was clear to me I was going to be charged!

Sure, I should have read the contract better, but the person at the counter ensured me that the extra was £40/day, but all of a sudden they charge for insurance, station charge, different fees, just because they had the chance to grab some extra bucks from someone in a very stressful situation.
They also scrolled through the contract and pointed to the signature field without giving me the option to read it beforehand.
I will never use Europcar again, they are a literal definition of a scam/fraudulent company. Never had an experience like this with their competitors Hertz and Sixt, go for them in stead, and stay FAR FAR FAAAR away from Europcar.

As I never get insurance cover (Carflexi can attest to this) I signed the papers and left. Only to find that I had been charged for premium insurance which cost more than the car hire itself. In addition, I was charged 40 pounds administration fee on a Dart crossing that I had already paid.

Despite this, Europcar have requested over £1600 in damages be paid by us. We were told by Europcar that if we had paid upfront, we would have received the money back once it had been settled through insurance. It is quite clear that they have no intention of settling this through insurance, as this would have been a straightforward claim and taken weeks to settle, and has now been ongoing for 10 months.

Neither Europcar or their legal representation have respond to our emails. In April, we managed to get a hold of the acting solicitors by phone, where their employee acted surprised and compassionate about what we had to tell her and asked us to send a full account of all evidence, comms with Europcar and witness statements. She assured us that she would be putting the account on hold whilst they investigated further and she would ensure we received responses to our emails (which we never did). It is now 4 months since then, and we have had no update on the outcome of their investigations or notice that the claim had been re-opened. They have now sent draft court letters out of the blue stating ‘multiple requests for payment’ - this seems unfair considering we were told everything was on pause.

Romie,2024-08-01,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/66aa4393ab06f442c06f48b3,"The upgrade was suggested by the employee herself because the car we ordered had room for 3 large suitcases (and was therefor ordered by us) and the one she suggested did not have enough space. In other words, the proposed car did not match the car we explicitly ordered. So after dealing with the papers, she put the paper, which said you had to pay for this upgrade, between the papers to be signed. So we signed these papers blindly and in good faith as she said NOTHING about the extra cost of the upgrade.

At no point was it mentioned that this would have an additional cost. We would have settled this immediately if this was the case and IF we agreed upon an extra cost. The fact that you did not do this until July 26 on your own initiative shows that there was no transparency about this.

We also asked before signing the documents whether there were any additional costs and that was not the case (the lady confirmed this))!
The deposit on my credit card was released only after my phone on 23 July where I had already returned the car on 9 July. The upgrade was also only taken from my credit card at that time whereas normally it should have been done immediately.
This really smells like a scam where they make the customer think they don't have to pay more for their supposedly good service that you pay dearly for. Because I had not booked directly with them, a deposit of 1061 € was reserved on my credit card, which was only released after I had inquired. I called Customer Service 3 times, hung on the line for 15 minutes each time and then put the phone down without explanation. NEVER AGAIN EUROPCAR!

We find this way of working unprecedented and unacceptable and we demand a full refund of the deducted amount immediately.

We count on the professional handling of this complaint.

Details:
We had 2 identical reservations. On the airport when taking the cars one of their workers tried to scam us on additional insurance for one reservation, but we didn't approve this cost and we were finally charged only with 100 GBP deposit per car as it supposed to be.
After coming back to Poland the deposits disappeared from the card, but day after charges fro 100, 100 and 290 GBP have appeared. For one reservation there was no invoice sent to the e mail. It took over a week for the customer service to sent It even tough I have sent them my agreement as attachmenet. It occured there is additional insurance for one reservation we didn't ordered.
I explained the situation from the airport, placed a complaint on that worker and demanded explenaition, but they haven't responded. Even though I have sent 3 reminder e mails regarding no response there was still silence.

I decided to open new case on customer service and after couple od days thay finally replied that the costs are valid. They have attached their version of the rental agreement. It occured that in ""Personal data"" there was some number to Switzerland (I am polish) and some dummy e-mail adres written in different handwriting then mine amd which I dont have on my copy of the document. That's why I haven't received an invoice on time I was still in UK. What's more there was additional page of agreement with ""additional optional products"" I haven't received from the worker and don't recall signing it.

On 6 July, I rented a Tesla Model 3 from Europcar at Heathrow Airport for a week. I prepaid £394.04, which included the Basic Protection Plan. Upon arrival, I was in a rush to pick up my family and trusted the Europcar employee, Danielle, who assured me that the only extra charge would be a refundable £510 deposit. I explicitly stated that I did not want any additional insurance.

To my surprise, when the invoice arrived, I was charged for:

Super Personal Accident Protection: £56
Selection Protection Package: £210
Roadside Assistance: £77.03

These charges were never discussed or agreed upon. The total amount on the invoice, including unexpected fees like a Premium Station Surcharge and various licenses, did not match the initial quote.

This isn't the first time I've encountered such issues with Europcar. Last year, a similar situation occurred, and despite raising a ticket, I received an unhelpful response, forcing me to accept the unjust charges.

This repeated experience of hidden costs and lack of transparency is unacceptable. I feel deceived and let down by Europcar’s practices. I urge potential customers to be extremely cautious and thoroughly review every detail before signing anything.

As we had another rental car company not honour our reservation due to car shortage, we had to walk into Eurocar.

Went through customer service who said too bad. $700cad/480£ for less than 24hr rental is robbery."

How is it the customers problem to inspect the vehicle (with a fine tooth comb as it turns out) to record any damage. You hire a car in good faith, I drive it carefully and respectfully as I would my own car. Then you get €742 taken out of your deposit for a mark that you can barely see close up yet the representative after looking at their phone/tablet went from the front of the car straight to it. Then quite cleverly made sure I didn’t have a photo of it before saying he would have to submit a damage report. Shame I can't post a photo the mark virtually disappeared when I gave it a quick rub with a damp cloth. I know a bit about car repairs and this would take less than 30 seconds with the correct polishing compound s where have they got €742 from? They are just making it up – its criminal and a money making racket. The rep even told me all repairs are done at the end of the vehicle life before they sell it on so it hasn’t stopped it being hired out again, the fact that the car handbrake operation was very poor was not even noted when I mentioned it.
It is a total scam and I thought Europcar was one of the bigger better companies, obviously not!
We were given a 80,000km Yaris in dark metallic grey with a lot of marks on it, how are you supposed to record every little defect on a dull day in a car park when you want to get on with your holiday? I wrote down tried to report further damage and was just told by their rep to go and photograph it. Yet when you return the car you are told it has had 3 inspections before it is hired out again, so nothing could be missed, yet I found several defects much worse that the mark in question that were missed, so the car has not been thoroughly inspected prior to hire. I will be talking to my credit card company and making a formal complaint

I had a vehicle from Europcar and on a Friday afternoon I got a call from Europcar Portadown requesting immediate return of the car as they had it booked in for an M.O.T test the next day and the m.o.t was expiring. In a foolish show of goodwill on my part, I left work early to allow Europcar to meet and exchange to another vehicle. This effort on my part didn't allow me time to refill the petrol tank to full. *it was half full when the exchange took place. I expected to pay for half a tank and would have had bo qualms doing so, however, I received an invoice in the post from Europcar for 36 litres of fuel and a ridiculous rate of £2.10 per litre. Considering the 50Litre capacity tank was half full I couldn't understand how they could fit 36 litres more in,and charge me an extortionate rate as reward for me helping them out. Car stank from first day I had it, no proper valeting carried out on that site in Portadown clearly. The replacement car also stank and they billed me for another £30 worth of petrol despite me returning it full! They are running a complete scam on that site.

**Update because Europcar has commented on this review** I put these points to Europcar before leaving this review hoping they would correct the charges made. I received a robotic email saying ""in line with our terms and conditions I am liable for the full amount"". They are a horrible horrible company."

I spent £65 to get to the branch and back as this was my closest branch with availability.

It’s completely unacceptable the call center and website would accept a booking. This is misleading and irresponsible.

Susan Deaconking,2024-07-17,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/6675f4b7db5d537efed1131a,"I rented a car from Europcar at Gatwick south terminal for a week from 5th June and when I dropped it back I was told by the man checking it in all was in order. No damage was seen as none existed and it was refuelled. I proceeded to the airport with my elderly mum. Today a week later I received a letter by email from Europcar from their insurance department telling me that there was left side left mirror cap/housing scratch >5-15 cm and that I am liable for an excess. I have a speech impediment so I had my husband ring them to discuss because of my poor speech I didn’t pass their data checks and needless to say they can’t discuss with him. GDPR
They told me to send an email because my speech is poor. I feel I have been targeted here as a soft touch. There was no damage and this is all a lie. I can do without this stress.
I advise you don’t ever consider a rental from this company. It was my first and last rental. This is a scam I am faced with. I sent an email and I await a reply.
This rental company isn’t worth the hassle and will cost me a lot if they succeed in telling me I damaged a car which I didn’t.

Ps following the reply below I have emailed many times and all I am told by three different replies there is there was damage on the car on return and I have been sent a ‘statement of return’ dated correctly but with a forgery signature on it. It states I ageee to damage on a side mirror. Doesn’t this really make you so annoyed. Where is the justice here. I have asked repeatedly for the name of the staff member but that person remains anonymous. They are hiding behind a company with a large customer services department but they are BAD. A photo attached but because this was not pointed out at the time of return I have no way to confirm this was or was not present. This is evil. I am 56 and I have been renting cars for 36 years and never have I had an experience as this. It’s pure fraud and this needs to be called out for what it is and Europcar need to look into this and their employees involved here. There are two who accepted back the car and one of those is the man at the rental desk the day I hired the car.
Who needs this hassel. Now a bill by email today for €274. Believe me they have picked the wrong person to annoy and I will not be parting with any of my money to settle this fraudulent bill. I am an honest person and if there was damage on the car and it was pointed out to me on return then I would be the first to pay up. In fact I have an insurance for the excess but this is wrong on all accounts and I will not be settling. How dare they treat their customers like this. Shame on them and shame on all Europcar for allowing this to happen despite my emails.
If I lived near Gatwick airport I would go to the europcar office there and find the members of staff involved. I would insist on looking at the damage on the car to measure if this scratch exists and if it is over 5cm even though this is now 5 weeks today after the car was returned.

Even though I had proof of payment on Revolut. So they charged me £60 weeks later without notice for the PCN and another $40 for their admin fee. Revolut froze my card immediately before the money was deducted and I got in touch with Europcar customer service. While the correspondence was still ongoing, they sent me a letter from their legal team threatening me with legal consequences if I don't pay within 14 days. Meanwhile they take a week to answer each email.

They said this is normal practice and I should have the right to appeal. But both Initial Parking and POPLA confirmed that once a PCN is paid, the matter is closed. A quick Google search about this returned forum threads talking about this scam between Initial Parking and rental companies. Yet they are pretending they're not aware of this. So beware!

Now they will reply to this review with a canned response (like they did on other sites) as if I haven't already been corresponding with their customer care for weeks. Forced to communicate with 3 different Europcar departments who clearly don't liaise between each other. It's like going round in circles and talking to a brick wall.

Alexander Mac,2024-06-18,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/66713cd65cf186c21196b551,Absolutely disgusting how they treated me. I have been renting for a couple of months and always pay each week to extend another week as required. I returned the first vehicle in perfect condition with a full tank and never received my deposit back. I then got another because it was my only option at the time and I was told I would receive my deposit back within 10 working days. I was made to pay another deposit for the new rental agreement so at this stage europcar had stolen my £250 and since have been given another £250. I then noticed money had been attempted to be taken out my bank account to the tune of £559 for no reason. I’ve since had another payment try to be taken from my account of nearly £400. I have paid over £1500 total to rent vehicles for 8 weeks and europcar are still wanting to steal money from my account without any correspondence or reasoning. Scamming company that must be doing this to everyone that rents from them. I will also copy and paste this onto every review site available so all can see it’s not just them that europcar have scammed. It’s everyone that uses the company in full trust that they’ll be given a decent well maintained vehicle and a fair price and total cost for a rental. The car they gave me struggled getting to 30mph and would start rolling backwards when going up any sort of incline. What a horrible company to rent from I’d use enterprise if I was you they charge a bit more but then they don’t become scum bag theives when it comes to requesting your deposit back. They provide vehicles that are properly maintained and suitable to drive in all conditions too

To my horror about Week plus after we had returned the car I found a debit to my account for an extra £239.27 for premium insurance protection and road side assist. Now yes I did sign the contract without checking the agreement because I trusted the desk representative when he said there were no extra payments to be made and I believed I had already paid in full on line. I suspect this is fraudulent practice and a deliberate up selling technique to gain commissions. BEWARE. I have had no help from Europcar to resolve this error.

I then rang and checked with my travel insurance company, who confirmed the excess was indeed totally covered by my policy. In spite of my emphatic declining of their insurance, the staff deliberately left it on the contract which they hurried me to sign as they were busy and I had already taken up time. If there is any problem with the contract or the car, it is then intentionally very difficult to contact Europcar during the rental period.

The story is that I reserved a car for £366 with basic insurance. However, when I arrived at their office at Stansted Airport, they suggested I upgrade to premium insurance for just an additional £4 per day, which would total £28 for 7 days. I agreed and signed the contract. After paying the original amount plus 28 pounds, they also mentioned they needed to reserve £400 for own risk, which I accepted.

Upon returning to the Netherlands, I received a bill for £642. When I checked, it turned out that the insurance was actually £28 per day, not £4. Although the bill I signed indeed stated £28 per day, I initially trusted their verbal claim and, being tired after my travel, did not double-check before signing.

This experience has been extremely frustrating. Please be cautious and carefully check everything if you choose to use Europcar. They were deceitful in my case, so ensure you verify all details before signing anything."

They offered us a great price with a small note stating there may be a surcharge if we cross over into Southern Ireland, and to speak to the desk on collection. In all my previous years I'd never heard of this but presumed its as a result of Brexit etc. and didn't think it would be significant.
At the airport all was going well until they informed us the cross border charge was around 140 euro (40+euro more than the cost of hire!) regardless of how many days we planned to visit. I complained that this was a hidden charge as we now couldn't cancel and look elsewhere (less than 24 hours notice). Most other companies only charge a one off fee of 30-40 euro so why was this so excessive and not advertised on their site. I guess its to attract people with a lower price then sting them at the airport. The lady at reception was not helpful offering that 'it's what the computer says'. When I enquired if the charge is a result of Brexit she even had the cheek to repeatedly call me Racist, trying to divert our complaint! Not a trustworthy company and very underhand tactics.

I wish I’d read the reviews here before hiring from Europcar. I booked through Holiday Autos for a Fiat500 at £60 for one day from Glasgow Airport, paid in advance. Staff very friendly and didn’t hard sell but asked about extra insurance but I declined as I have a policy that covers this already. I was informed no further payments were required. When I brought the car back it was checked in, no damage and full fuel. There’s a petrol station right at the entry to the returns that I’d used so it was brimming!

The next day I receive an invoice for £112 which incorporates a “Premium Protection Package” that I did not agree too, a “Premium Station Charge” which I was told nothing about, “Licences and Fees” charge which again I have no knowledge of what this is and lastly, a charge for used fuel even though I brought the car back with full fuel which was verified by the check in guy.

What’s even more suspicious, they charged my credit card with an entirely different amount, which was even more!!! This makes a day small car hire £200 from Europcar!

I contacted customer services to say they have made an error and to please refund the money. They say:
“I can confirm that the charge has been applied in accordance with the Terms and Conditions and therefore a refund would not be due on this occasion.”

After the (successful) rental period, some days later I realized that i was charged an extra 173GBP, which was a surprise.

After some emails (booking.com responded fast, europcar usually with 4-5 days delay) i got the info, that i bought a premium insurance at the desk (at pick up), so they cannot help. The car had 2x insurances, according to their helpdesk: “with my verbal agreement and unable to comment further as I was not part of the verbal discussion”...

What?!

At pick up, the agent (who was kind by the way) confirmed, that it is paid and it has full insurance, and i said ""yes, i know"", because i have chosen the option ""full insurance"" at booking.com. This was the full conversation about the insurance.
He didn't offer any other one.
There was no ""verbal agreement"". It was a trap.
The paper, which i signed there, my copy contained one line on the 1st page (with very small font) about a premium insurance, but it seemed to be the paid one (for me). In fact, this was a new insurance, which was twice as expensive than the whole rental!

So my advice: read very carefully the paper at pick up, because they have put an extra, unwanted item in my case.

The guy in the parking lot was kind, but the communication after the rental process was not cooperative. They repeated the same answer (copy+paste), not responding my questions, slowly, and didn’t help the find the agent (or give direct contact) who could confirm the situation. I tried to call them (desk at Glasgow airport, with no success, waiting during the ""please wait music"" for a long time). The europcar UK was a wall, which I bounced back.

This case could ruin all the whole holiday. I have to focus strongly on the positive side of the trip, otherwise this ruins it fully. :("

We were told they didn’t have any which was not true as we could see them. We were then told the extra insurance we had bought through the booking agency was not valid and we had to take out theirs for €210. I called the booking agency and they said this was not true and our insurance was valid and we didn’t need to get any more. Then we were told the car needed to go through the car wash and eventually 2.5 hours later we got a large Hyundai Kona (not a small compact car as ordered) we took it as could not bothered to argue any more.

The only redeeming feature is that the internal complaints team actually do try and resolve things. Though they don't seem to stand a chance with this ridiculous company.

Johnny,2024-04-09,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/6615192b43d2b29c16d0ebe4,"I recently picked up a car from Manchester Airport, & was given two fuel options by the Europcar staff member.
1. Return tank full.
2. Return car without refilling & pay Europcar for the fuel.
The staff member advised me option 2 would work out cheaper, as their fuel was 6p per litre cheaper than the local garage. This seemed too good to be true, so I clarified this with the staff member. I informed him where I'd be travelling & he said option 2 was definitely best.
You can imagine my surprise when I was charged £50.40 (taken from my Credit Card) for using less than a 1/4 tank of petrol (which should have cost approx £13).
When I queried this with Europcar they said I'd signed the documents to say I'd prepay for a full tank of fuel! Like most people, I assumed the documents, I signed, outlined what had been discussed. I believe this is a classic case of misleading customers for financial gain. Europcar are refusing to refund the difference."

Booking reference number 1096812701

The issue that I have experienced was: I made a reservation in the Europcar office in wandsbek (directed through the Uk website) and the girl told me a reservation of 300 euro is needed, I made the payment but said she can’t see it on the system that something had happened to her sister. She asked me to make a further 1 euro payment so she can complete the booking and I did. The 1 euro has now came back and it had been more than 3 days and the 300 euro is still outstanding on my card that I need to make important purchases such as food for my children and my money hasn’t come back.

It occurred on: 2024-03-23

This meant that My 300 euro is still outstanding from this booking and with the possibility it was not attached to my booking.

I want my money released as soon as possible. Your staff are untrained and do not know what they are doing

I look forward to your prompt response on this matter. As recommended by Trading Standards, I would like to keep a complete record of my case, so please reply to this email address.

Mistakenly drove car through a ""bus only during specified hours"" lane on two occasions. As a tourist, and being unfamiliar with the area, these things happen. Not unexpectedly, an infringement notice issued for each, which I duly paid.
However I received a message from AMEX that Europcar trying to take £40 out of my account (twice). Very sneaky trying to take money out of my credit card without even asking me or telling me what is for. AMEX blocked the payments. When Europcar eventually notified me, they said this was a ""processing fee"" for each infringement notice, asserting this is representative of the ""loss and damage"" they suffered as a consequence of the occurrence. What a crock! They suffered no loss. The fine itself was £70, reducing to £35 if paid promptly. I have paid the reduced fine so the ""processing fee"" exceeds the fine!
The claim amounts to a ""penalty"" which would be unenforceable under UK law, despite what the Europcar Ts and Cs suggest to the contrary. The scam works because it is cheaper for us poor mugs who live overseas to cough up rather than be followed up by a bunch of debt recovery lawyers.
Beware!

UPDATE:
Europcar has responded to me inviting me to click on a link and send a message. I have done so but the messaging facility initially appeared to be non-functional. It's not helping their case. My booking number is 1165411709. I invited them to contact me via my email address on their file. They did not. Their lawyers did send me another message however.
The ""contact"" link is now functional, and I have contacted Europcar direct as requested. They say they will respond in seven days.

Ms Alice Smith,2024-03-04,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/65e5b61e865aa4162da06134,"My boyfriend booked a car for Malta through Europcar as advertised through the website. He made this booking over the phone and received a confirmation email of the booking.

We arrived in Malta to be told that our car was given to another person because our flight was delayed by 1 hour and that to give us a new car it would cost an extra 81euros and extra 800euro deposit. They explained that because we had not given our flight number they didn't save the car for us.

When my boyfriend had originally booked the flight over the phone this detail was not given by the europcar assistant and this was not stated in the email. Therefore this is the mistake of Europcar.

We straight away rang Europcar and they said they couldnt get us a car because they werent associated with the Malta branch.... They said they would refund the initial booking.

Thankfully we could travel by taxi, this was an extra cost to us... they offered no solution. This could have been catastrophic if in a different location and a different time.

After out holiday we contacted Europcar because we had heard nothing about the refund. Europcar then told us that they had investigated the matter and we had to pay 95Euros for the cancellation... which we never made and not previously been told.

This is not what they told us on the day that we arrived in Malta, why then would we have chosen to cancel for 95euros when we could have just paid 81euros for the other vehicle....

So now we have paid 81Euros for the initial booking and 95euros for ""the cancellation"", for a car that we never got to use because of Europcars bad organisation. This is an absolute scam, Eruopcar have offered no resolution. Would not recommend, and would avoid at all costs."

Sean Lu,2024-02-13,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/65caaaea25bd81b782d08be6,"My car was hit and the insurance company - Marshmallow, arranged for this rental car company - Europcar to provide me with a courtesy car. The driver delivered the courtesy car to my house but didn't ask for my signature, instead, he just inserted the keys into my front door mailbox and left. Ridiculously Europcar requested that I personally deliver the signed documents to their office (your employee did not ask me to sign the document in person, and now you are requesting me to personally deliver the document back to your office? Is this the proper way to treat a customer?).

Afterward my car is repaired, the garage delivered it back to my home without notice, and the staff of garage said he will drive the courtesy car back to their garage. Europcar will directly retrieve the courtesy car from their garage (I just immigrated to the UK, and I don't know if this is a normal practice, but the driver emphasize that it is normal in the UK, said no worries).

Two days later, I received an invoice from Europcar by email which is charging me for petrol fees. I can understand this, but when I returned home that day, I only discovered that the driver said he need to take the courtesy car away. At that time, I didn't think about returning the car with a full tank of petrol, and then I received a very unreasonable fuel charge.

I sent two emails to Europcar to express my dissatisfaction and explain the situation when I returned the courtesy car (I understand that I need to return the courtesy car with a full tank of petrol, but the problem is I had no idea the garage driver would suddenly ask to take it away). I requested that the fuel cost be charged based on the actual market price, but I did not receive any response. After that, I returned to my hometown for three weeks. I did not receive any email, phone call, or SMS reminder from Europcar during that period.

When I returned to the UK, I received a letter from Shakespeare Martineau which is pursuing the debt on behalf of Europcar, with a late payment charge of £40. From day one I have never received an original invoice from Europcar, only electronic ones, which do not mention any penalties for late payment.

I finally settled the invoice payment to Shakespeare Martineau before the deadline. At the same time, I emailed the payment receipt to Europcar and Shakespeare Martineau, emphasizing repeatedly that the £40 late payment charge is unreasonable. I won't bear this unreasonable charge.

Two weeks have passed and I just received an email from Shakespeare Martineau, saying that I haven't paid the outstanding debt. Today, I called Europcar to inquire about it, but the staff said they don’t know what’s happening and asked me to call another number for further information. And then I waited for 20 minutes, and in the end, they asked me to leave a message saying they would call me back.

I have been living in the UK for 2 years, and sincerely, many of my friends have had to contact insurance companies for claims due to traffic accidents. Many of them say that Marshmallow Insurance Company's handling of insurance claims is poor. I really didn't expect it to be this bad. I am the victim, my car got hit. The other party says it's a company car and asks me to claim compensation from their insurance company. I didn't expect that later on, Marshmallow, the law firm and Europcar would all constantly seek opportunities to charge fees from me or the other party. This is simply an all-in-one scam that insurance companies have taken advantage of government regulatory loopholes and expanded. Under the guise of claims insurance, actually providing various services under different pretexts and then charging exorbitant and unreasonable fees.

I will give Europcar a negative review and raise awareness to their opaque operations. In any situation, whenever individuals file a claim with their insurance company, it is always the citizens who end up being the victims while these businesses benefit."

Everything went wonderfully during the booking and pickup, and Europcar was very friendly. The hefty bill came afterwards. When searching for a vehicle on the Sunny Cars website, I was looking for one with an automatic transmission. Ultimately, I received a vehicle category with a manual transmission. According to the customer service's view, I should have memorized the booking categories. Europcar then asked if I wanted a vehicle with an automatic transmission, which I affirmed because I believed I had booked it as such. Afterwards, I was charged for the upgrade, plus a location surcharge that should have also been included in the price.

Both Europcar and Sunny Cars worked hand in hand here and made it as confusing as possible in order to be able to charge an additional 500€ afterwards."
Jo,2024-02-07,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/65c35db79eab0e29272b51b4,"To start my experience with the company, they failed to deliver the vehicle as prebooked 1 month in advance. They didn't even communicate that they were going to fail to deliver the vehicle.

It was supposed to arrive at 14:00. At 14:30 I rang to see where it was. Customer support admitted they had made a mistake and that a car would be with me by 17:00. I waited until 17:15 and rang again. Customer support told me that they could no longer get the vehicle to me that day. My car was in repair the following day and the booking had to be cancelled as I need a vehicle for work. The car finally turned up at 14:00 the following day. A full 24 hours late. Do not rely on them if like me you cannot work without a vehicle.

Following this awful experience and came here and read reviews that stated that the company try to scam you out of fuel money when you return the vehicle. Having read these reviews I kept a copy of the transaction at the petrol station where I filled up one mile from the drop off location and took time stamped pictures of the fuel gage clearly reading full at the drop off location.

I receive an email a few days later and the reviews are true to their word. The have charged me £18 for fuel. I send in a complaint with the supporting evidence and they responded sending me a picture of a graph that shows that I fully fuelled up the car stating that they have rejected my complaint and have charged in accordance with T and Cs. They highlighted on the graph a point after the car had already been handed back and they had been driving it around.

This is a scam company and I would avoid them at all costs. If you cannot avoid them then I would say ensure you collect all evidence of fuelling up but that has made little difference."
Chad Hussain,2024-01-31,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/65ba4452d0d368c36da0a8bb,"After another car hire company let me down I walked into Manchester Airport Europcar and asked if I could hire a car on the spot. The young man went and spoke to his manager and then came back and said yes he had a car available.
This is where the misleading begins.
I asked for 3 days - Wednesday to Saturday morning - He put 5 days on the order
He mentioned a full tank of petrol from Europcar - I refused.
He mentioned NOTHING else. My other hire was 56 GBP for 3 days - He quoted me 515GBP for 3 days
He then said I was a privileged customer and he could discount that to 428 including a 100 GBP deposit.
All the while indicating this was the cost of the car hire for 3 days
It wasn't -
He'd added
2 extra days
Premium Protection 5 days - 173.49 GBP
Roadside Assistance 5 days - 65.47 GBP

Begrudgingly I agreed to the amount of 328 + 100 deposit thinking this was the price of a car last minute in the middle of a rail strike.
He then pointed to certain x parts on the form to sign - I duly signed NOT realising he had added these EXTRAS.
After getting in the car and driving home I double-checked the paperwork and was gobsmacked the actual hire cost for what I had ordered should be 45 GBP
He'd managed to slide in 239 GBP of extras (days and extras)

I immediately called the bookings line of Europcar and this is where they really DO NOT CARE - AT ALL
Call 1 - Put the phone down after my explanation
Call 2 - Took my details but no reference number - Also said he could amend a booking to be bigger but could NOT amend a booking once it was paid even if it was wrong
Call 3 - Customer services - he eventually made a case but had no details in it and kept me on hold for a very long time.
He would not give me any option to escalate
He only gave me the standard CS email
He also would not amend the booking even though we were 3 hours into the hire. He said he couldn't do anything once it was signed and paid for.
His comments were ""You should have checked the booking before signing it"" - Quite rudely

In that he's correct -

With Europcar I as an unsuspecting customer would expect to be misled - it seems an established practice to sell extras
I would expect they add details that you never discussed and never asked for
Do NOT sign anything until you've checked the dates, days, and extras plus the car.
Europcar is comfortably in my experience the worst hire company operating in the UK. I'd avoid them at any and all costs. It cost you an awful lot of money as I'm finding out."

Its just as well as the Car later turned out to be scuffed and had a chipped windscreen which was attributed to me. Had I not had this additional insurance it would have come out on my pocket. The moral of the story check the excess as the standard excess is 1600 pounds. As if that wasnt bad enough they added strange surchages to my bill for example a premium station surchage and other licence fees. These were not expected or explained.

I specifically asked if this offer was made under the clause in the contract: 'or a similar car'. This was confirmed. My mistake is that I then signed in haste and confidence.

After all, I had signed. But I did expect something of customer-friendliness and an apology for the course of events. An attempt to take the reported experience of being misled seriously and perhaps an offer to instruct staff better. Nothing of the sort. So beware at Europcar Edinburgh. Not to be trusted.

She says yes of course, but if you are going to the highlands, i recommend you to take a 4X4 (a Mercedes GLB) and it does have winter tyres and forecast says we might get some snow.
Ok fair enough i say, security has no price right, but you are offering me a car that is 2200£ while i ordered a 664.57£ one.
I don't mind but i want to check the car tyres first.
I go and check the car tyres and not only they were all summer tyres, but on top of that they had 3 tyres from a different brand out of the 4. This is a NO GO even if the car has AWD and it's absolutely illegal in many countries all over the world (but not in the UK).
I came back and asked to be given another car and price difference refunded.
I had to go on the parking slot for 1 hour to find the only car that had M+S (mud and snow) stamp on the tyre side-wall (the rest was a disaster with plenty of cars with 3 different summer tires and none of them had all season tyres).
I said i want that one. It was an MG EHS Hybrid.
Please refund me the price difference.
After pushing me to take all sort of insurance i told her i only want the bare minimum, i don't need all that crap.

MG EHS is a budget family SUV car that is worth 37,000€ in Belgium when bought new. In no way it can cost the double of a Mercedes CLA 200 AMG Line to be rented that costs 50,000eur.
This is a clear SCAM.
Of course i couldn't check what the correct price would have been within their parameters by making a simulation online in their website but i knew i was definitely for sure getting scammed and i had no other choice than pay and go away.
When i left the desk, after a few meters i see behind my shoulders the lady laughing with his colleague talking about me and laughing loudly, almost having a laughter.
I have travelled all over the world, dealt with many renting companies like sixt, avis, europcar. But the very despicable way i was treated by this europcar agency is simply out of this world.
SHAMEFUL! I will continue my social bashing of this company, until someone will contact me.They do not deserve to be operational. Scamming and disrespecting like this their customer."
Miss J Burton,2024-01-26,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/65a3a0da9d3d3ddf969e50cf,"Firstly, this is an incident at Lisbon Airport but I know many uk people who hire from here. I was given a very scuffed car which was impossible to evidence all of the scuffs, scratches and dents on the documentation. I was advised that anything under 5 cm was not documented. I thought at the time, they are going to blame me some of these on me... I was told at the desk that if I had a puncture, this was not covered by roadside assistance. At the car I asked about this and was advised there is a kit in the boot. We checked and there was not one! He fetched one... Another alarm bell was, I knew I was returning the car at 4am, out of hours with no one available to verify the state of the car. Again, I thought they are going to blame me for some of these scuffs. I took photographs before leaving and on returning... But guess what? They are trying to charge me for damage I did not do. I can not report any outcome as I am still pursuing this. They have not yet taken money from my credit card, but my goodness... they can look out if they do... Obviously, no more custom from me! Beware people, of this very disgraceful scam. I will post this on a Europcar for Portugal if I can find one.
24 Jan 2024 Update: this has now been resolved. To take my money for something I didn't do would have been fraud. Pity they put me through the stress of all of this. For this reason, I will avoid Europcar in future."
Gary Smith,2024-01-14,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/65a30a3ada0eeb2e0cc7d6b8,"I booked a van to pick up some furniture. I used the Woodford Green office because it was close to my house.

Upon arrival at 8am, I was the second customer waiting. By the time I was allocated a van, it was 9am.

I took a picture of the dash to ensure the mileage and fuel were recorded. I also noticed some existing damage on the van which the salesperson did not highlight so ensured this was recorded.

I drove 344 miles which meant I exceeded the 250 mile cap by 94 miles. I was prepared to pay the 17p per mile which should have equated to £17. I also filled the van with diesel to the same level as I received it. When I returned the van the following morning at 8am, the staff had not yet arrived. I waited until 8:30 the before someone processed my return using a mobile phone application because the office was still closed.

A week later, I receive an invoice from Europcar stating that I’d driven 339 excess miles and was also charged for additional fuel and a fuel surcharge.

This is downright theft. Instead of paying £64.50 plus the £17 for additional miles, I was charged £189.24. What a disgraceful company."

I booked a car through EasyJet/CarTrawler paying in full for the rental, including insurance. I was told at Europecar counter that the car cannot be released because my Northern Ireland license could not be verified through some cluncky website that did not work. Nothing about this was mentioned when I bought the rental and paid up front. I ended up having to buy another expensive premium insurance package before the car was released. Extremely stressful experience that ruined my holiday. Avoid Europecar and CarTrawler if you want peace of mind and you don't want the stress of being ripped off by these scavengers.

Update 15/1/2024: As can be seen by the reply from Europcar they are happy to pass the blame to CarTrawler, who in turn pass the blame to Europcar. As a customer you would be best place to avoid both these companies that are happy to take your money and then point fingers at the other party. The customer is the loser at the end of the day!"

Despite explicitly stating I do not wish any additional insurances or addons on pickup I was charged 110 GBP after the rental for several things like breakdown insurance, driver insurance etc. I already contacted customer support and they were unwilling to help in the matter. Very unfortunate that I will have to resort to a credit card chargeback. Clerks are trimmed to try and hide extra charges so you sign the contract without noticing them. It is bad enough they try this with people who do not know about this but it is REALLY bad when you explicitly decline and they still put it on the contract and then hide the section by conveniently placing another sheet of paper on top of that section of the contract. I only noticed until after I signed but then it was ""too late"" because I had already started the rental. I thought this was a reputable company... Stay away from Europcar!"

My partner and I rent cars from Edinburgh airport about 5 times a year. Never had an issue with a UK car rental company, until now - Merry Christmas I guess.
- we pick up a car.
- lady at the reception tells us to fill fuel back to existing level (3/4 full) on return.
- on return 3 days later, we check the paperwork to double check, before going to petrol station.
- the paper work does not stipulate level of petrol at check in, so we take the word of the kind lady at reception, and fill it back to 3/4 on the nose. I have a photo of our rental agreement and the staff did not circle the fuel status…
-we arrive at drop of point to an unstaffed unit (all other companies had people there helping). No problem, we drop the keys in the letterbox and go get our flight.
- two days later we receive a charge of £20 for fuel, and £18 to fill up plus tax, so another £40+ quid. Apparently we need to fill it to the top? Despite it being only 3/4 full when we got it? Is this really the policy? If yes this is a total scam

As I say, we have a photo of rental agreement without any direction on fuel level, so hopefully this is resolved quickly.

Just FYI at Edinburgh airport there is an Avis and Budget car rental. We have used those before and never had any issues, they provide clear instruction, and honour their word and do not try and scam their customers. We will be using them next time and suggest anyone reading to as well.

Also I haven’t even got to the excess cover option on the insurance - at check in they tried to double our rental cost with this (£25 a day!!!). At this point I am starting to think it is just a racket…

Car was over an hour and a half late in spite of reassurances when I was in the office.

When received car, it was upgraded as an apology and I was told they'd extend my booking at no extra charge, for what would be an extra 2.5 - 3 hours on my 24 hour booking.
I received my deposit back within the week - awesome! However, I then receive an invoice not only charging me for the extra time, but for refuelling it to a full tank (I received it with a half tank), plus an £18 refuelling service. I was also charged a £6.96 pound 'vehicle recovery surcharge'. I had opted for £17 extra insurance for the day - what was not mentioned was that there was a 20% tax on that as well. I was charged for 2 days insurance which was over £40!

I contacted customer service via email and they did eventually reduce my petrol charge (I was 8 litres shy of half way). however they were still charging me for 2 days of insurance.
I emailed, and eventually called from my home country (Australia) to contest paying for the extra days insurance, was shut down without much explanation beyond - its in the system that way, or we can't look at those records. I have no apparent recourse.

I want to pay what I owe for my error with refuelling and my days insurance, but the bill sits over £33 over as they wont change it. I have told them i want to pay what i agreed to in writing and over the phone.

Had such an awful experience, and I am now being threatened that I must pay within 7 days lest I be hit with more fees and charges, and be unable to rent from them again. Honestly, I don't think I will.

couldn't recommend them less."

Nino Capparella,2023-12-18,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/65805c6a0bbe5d510cc4d18c,"We rented a car twice in London City Airport and it all went smooth. 3 months later, both times, we were then charged because of some damage. The trick they do is that - if you don't return the car when someone is there, they simply charge you as no-one can prove you didn't do it. We thoroughly checked the car both times before leaving and there were no scratches at all. Funny enough the scratch only appeared 3 months later - god knows how many people used that car meanwhile. There's no point in appealing because they have 1000 clauses - so if anyone know from CS try to say "" can you please give us your reference no. etc"" - sure, nice to show that you care, but there has been months of conversations while our money was taken instantly

In summary, make sure that you return the car when there's someone there to check it with you as otherwise they will scam you"
Claire Ashworth,2023-12-18,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/657fa75e5c6f7cf6a110eb18,"My rating would be 0 if possible.

As with some of the other reviews - the employees will charge you for extras you explicitly say you don’t want or need.

I just got off a 7 hour overnight flight with zero sleep to be met with Danielle at Europcar. She asked if I wanted Full Coverage and I said no - I was sure I already purchased it with I booked. I checked my email and found the confirmation; showed it to her. She explained I had paid for it through the booking company I had used - not Europcar - so if there were issues I had to go through them. I said that was totally fine.

She then asked for my credit card for a deposit. I asked ‘you’re not charging my card anything today?’ She assured me ‘No just the deposit’.

Got home to find she had charged me extra waivers that she never even mentioned!!!!! What’s more - she got me to sign the form, casually saying ‘it’s just the rental agreement’. Not ever pointing to the daily waivers she had added.

Maybe it’s a case of ‘more fool me for not reading it explicitly’, but having said I did not want any more coverage and her not once pointing out the extras she added as I signed - I feel totally conned and scammed. She literally lied to me as I swiped my credit card. And had the cheek to ask for a good review!

What’s more - absolutely NO acknowledgment or reply from the various emails I have logged through customer service. But they have replied speedily to my credit card company after I opened a dispute - providing evidence that I am responsible for this charge.

My advice is to stay away. Use any other car rental. How they can morally operate this way is diabolical."
David Puzey,2023-12-12,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/65784362ee80f2462d3afa25,"TLDR: Mostly unimpressed!

I will give them that it was relatively easy to book and pick up, however there were several things that left us very unimpressed and unlikely to use them again. First of all the van we received had a headlight out and no windscreen washer fluid. They told us to go to Halfords who sorted it but we really shouldn't have been given a vehicle with these issues, especially as we picked it up in the dark and the employee left so swiftly that we didn't have an opportunity to mention it by the time we'd realised.

The other issue was about their booking system and extra charges. Their booking system let us book the return time as 9pm without informing us that there were additional charges for returning a vehicle out of business hours, it showed us a charge for the duration of the pickup to drop off times as a set price implying that the total duration of us having the van was covered by this cost. We then received a confirmation email that very clearly said that drop off time was 9pm and when we picked up the van the employee told us it didn't matter what time we dropped it off as they were closed from 1pm. After we dropped the van back we received an email saying we would be charged extra as we dropped it off outside of business hours and when we questioned this with their customer support they just told us ""well you should have read the small print"" without addressing any of our concerns, it honestly felt like they didn't even read the email. I sent a follow up email and again they didn't address anything I mentioned just that they'd be charging us anyway. Overall customer service felt very dismissive and entirely uninterested in dealing with customer concerns or complaints.

I do understand extra charges for out of hours returns however I don't think it's fair to allow these times to be selected at booking without clearly informing the customer that the extra charges are there (even allowing a specific time out of hours is odd) and even giving them the option of adding the cost on to be paid upfront (for those of us who know we'll return late). It also shouldn't have specifically included the time in the confirmation email without a warning nor should we have been told we could return the van at any time without also being told it would count as after hours. This was all very misleading. When booking the list of returns times should change based on the locations opening hours so only these times are clearly listed and then have an ""out of hours"" option that has the time range for ""out of hours"", so if the location closes at 5pm and opens at 8:30am it should say something like ""17:00-08:30 (Out of hours charges apply)"" to make it clear.

The problem here is really that they very clearly set the expectation that returning the van at 9pm was included within the price we paid which made the additional charge feel deceptive or at very least highly misleading."

Totally the opposite to what I had requested and been sold. Is this Europcar policy or did your agent go rogue? Either way I think it’s fraudulent deceit.

Joshua Barton,2025-03-06,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/65775b16a5d264e81e1ffb95,"I booked a van to go from Birmingham to Edinburgh Leith, with a drop-off time of 11pm on a Saturday.

Europcar signed everything off, gave me a fixed ""guaranteed"" price of ~£350 for a one-way trip, and all details were correct.

I arrive in Edinburgh at 2pm on the Saturday, and go to return the van early. I find out that Edinburgh Leith closes at 12 on a Saturday and is closed through Sunday. After phoning Europcar Leith, and then Europcar (main centre), I get to Edinburgh Airport who advise me that I should just hold onto the van and pay the extra 2 days worth of renting so I can return it on the Monday.

I advise them that I am happy to drop it off at Edinburgh Airport as they are the ones who are forcing me to either pay extra for an extended rental agreement that was not originally agreed to when I paid. Edinburgh Airport say that they're happy to take the van and that I would not be charged anything for this.

I receive the ""van is perfect, you'll get your full deposit back"" form back from Europcar, and then find a couple days later that they are holding onto my deposit and that I owe an additional £600 for a ""one-way surcharge"". This ""one-way surcharge"" was not in the price guarantee, and has not been communicated to me.

I have been spending the past 3 weeks trying to resolve this, and have had 2 ""cases"" opened by Europcar to investigate this, but none have been closed or have given me any inkling into what actions will be done, despite being told I will hear back within 10 business days.

The company is an absolute scam, branches do not communicate to each other, and every representative is willing to blatantly lie so that they do not need to speak with you further.

UPDATE: It took emailing every board member at Europcar to be escalated to the ""Executive Complaints"" teams, who supposedly looked at my case and acknowledged I was overcharged and removed the note on my credit report and all outstanding charges - and that was it. At the time, I was trying to apply for a mortgage and Europcar made this unbelievably stressful as I had a ""defaulted"" account on my credit report. Do not use. I cannot reiterate this enough."

We paid 180 pounds and we asked that it be refund because we paied for the full cover for our rental.

Guy Harding,2023-11-16,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/6555a5478973a06fe7e4019e,"Scammers, Cheaters, Con artists. When you read through the reviews here, it comes up many, many times.

Unfortunately, I now know why.

I have used Europcar around the world for decades, and if this branch is an indication of what the company has become, then I would advise everyone to stay away!

I prebooked a Ford Focus 10 days for 434.40 gbp - pretty normal.
I went to collect my reservation at Heathrow after 65 hours of travel, pre booked and price set at 434.40 gbp.

At the counter, the agent said ""free upgrade to an automatic Mercedes"".

She then took credit card Authorisation, and only when I spotted the amount on the eftpos terminal, did I spot that I had been charged 1398.40 gbp, so an unauthorised jump of 964 GBP.

Immediately raised the issue, the staff acknowledged the incorrect amount, but they refused to reverse the credit card authorisation. They then said they would draw up a new contract at the original quoted amount.

They flat refused to give me a copy of the original invoice.

They said they could not refund the credit card, it would take at least 14 days - So if I took the original (3 times quoted amount) they could reverse it, otherwise not possible.

This is becoming obvious at this point that it is some form of ""commission scam"".

So now I have 2 pending amounts against my visa, obviously affecting the total limit of the card.

Next, I went to pick up the vehicle, I am given a Vauxhall Crossland (I requested a Ford Focus), and the state the vehicle is in, is disgusting, and this shouldn't be given to any customers. If this is the state of your fleet, you should retire them.

The vehicle has been used by a heavy smoker, the car reeks of smoke, and there is cigarette burns on the driver’s seat.

The outside of the vehicle has damage on every panel and the wheels. It looks like it has been through some form of war.

I have a full video of the state of the vehicle before collection.

So I drive out of the lot with my poor looking Crossland, get on the freeway to head a couple of hours down to Southampton. Hot day, AC on, and AC doesn’t work!

Called customer help line, get nowhere. I then head up to Milton Keynes and go to the Europcar depot there. The counter manager was helpful, test drives the car & confirms AC does not function at all. This is Thursday. They do not have a replacement car, so they promise to call me the next day for a swap over.

No call. Go to the depot on Saturday & its closed.

Call customer helpline. they confirmed Milton Keynes is closed (yep, sitting outside it).

Their suggestion was to head to Luton Airport (I was now at Silverstone) a round trip of 4 hours (remember no aircon, and hottest September in 30 years).

I had to pay for the extra mileage & fuel of course.

I arrived at Luton, Staff were good, Friendly. They then gave me an Vauxhall CORSA. A little beat up, but better than the last OPEL. I headed off out of the compound to have the oil light & check engine lights both start flashing. Tried the Air conditioning & completely non functional. (Don't know if air conditioning failure is standard on these Vauxhall's).

Back to the depot (another 20 mile loop). The lot operator was super helpful, and we checked the oil, not even showing on the dipstick. Then we checked the front tyres, Both completely bald, the LH one showing canvas.

He was embarrassed (felt sorry for him) he took us inside to the manager, and took a while, but they found a SEAT CUPRA manual. It was tidy, and everything worked!

Rest of the trip went as it should have.

3 weeks to have my original amount (1398.40gbp) refunded.

Do not trust or use Europcar Heathrow."

On the phone, the person said they can't deliver the vehicle for me so I have to pick it up, but they can certainly come to collect from a different location. I was then quoted £241.64. I told the person the phone that online ita a completely different price. He said I was wrong or the website is wrong. I tried to explain that this is slightly misleading, but the person on the phone very much ignored me. Okay, whatever, went ahead and paid after confirming I will collect the car from Chester and it would be picked up in Mold. The confirmation email says Chester to Chester which I can't do! Called today to amend the booking to a shorter period only to be told its not possible because I prepaid. I will have to cancel the whole thing and re-book which would include additional charges. What?! Had I been told when booking in the first place its not amendable, I would've just done it online, but apparently not because the website is wrong anyway and wouldnt work. So now, I have a booking which is has been overcharged, wrong and uncancellable without incurring further charges."
Oliwia Kurach,2023-11-02,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/6543d9023cc38d65251ceb53,Avoid at all cost. We were told we would be charged the total amount of £167 for the van rental with no hidden cost. And yes we have signed the documents without reading it properly so yes you can argue it was our fault but tbh we have trusted the person was explaining everything to us. Days after the rental £249 came out our account for the hire and premium cover which we did no agreed to . Numerous of phone calls and emails later they don’t want to hear it but are happy to mislead and missale. Absolutely shocking customer service and managers only available if you really push to speak them

I used one of their cars for 5 days for short trips in my city and used less than a quarter of the fuel tank. I filled it up to the top which cost around £35 and gave it back to them. They just charged me an extra £23 for fuel and I know there is no way I used £55 worth of fuel in 5 days."
Gian Franco Bono,2023-11-02,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/6543849f2c2d917068d00063,"I am not used to publishing negative comments, but, after having gone through the official channels and having received a negative response to the complaint, I am going to explain my experience relating to a car rental in London Gatwick with Europcar.
After booking and paying for the rental and premium insurance in Arguscarhire online, I was told to go to the Europcar desk.
There, after pointing out to the employee that we had already signed up for the premium policy online, I was asked to sign the forms to proceed with the rental. I thought the various amounts summarized the coverage already purchased, but at no time the employee mentioned additional costs.
Consider that it was almost midnight, people in line and the difficulty of the language.
Result: compared to the online rental + insurance cost of around €200 with Arguscarhire, I was charged an additional €360 for additional insurance coverage that was not requested!
The response was that I had signed, but judge for yourself whether this is correct and serious behavior towards a customer.
I read other comments and I'm not the first.
Dear Europcar, is this your way of doing business?"
Fahim Qureshi,2023-10-29,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/653e578811c782712bcd84de,"The worst rip off I have experienced I will never hire from them again as I am still
Owed £72 for fuel that I didn’t use .
The customer service doesn’t listen , investigate or resolve, you get sent around and around in circles
The only recourse I have is to call them out and warn others not to use them on sites such as this So once again I had to hire a vehicle and hired from Enterprise who were amazing, straight forward and not misleading and much cheaper experience than these lot and if your at Luton Airport Hire car collection / booking it’s the next counter along. My custom now is with Enterprise always"
Andrew W,2023-10-30,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/653d402daf61e3f67e63d990,"I was given a free upgrade as a returning customer, when picking up the car, however when the final invoice was received I had been charged for the upgrade.

When returning the vehicle some damage was pointed out on the wheel. I could not find all of my pictures, but before leaving the car drop off area I found the relevant pictures but the agent would not up date his report.

I have had a response which is the standard brush off, ignoring the conversation held with their agent. Definitely a scam, do not use them even if they show you pictures of their Mainecoon cat!!"
Simon W,2023-10-26,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/653a6bcc2f0579cc9d469907,"My partner and I chose Europcar to book a car from Carcassonne, France in September.
We chose them purely because they appeared to be the only Company to have an open desk when our flight landed, which actually turned out not to be the case.
Collecting the car itself was not a problem apart from attempted upselling in an effort to get us to pay more money.
We refused two larger cars and collected a very adequate VW Polo which we were not shown round.
Upon returning the car, which was then closely inspected, a tiny mark on the left hand rear door’s paintwork was pointed out, but as we had taken out full damage indemnity, we were not greatly concerned.
This was a mistake which later cost us €87 as a damage administration fee.
Other charges that were subsequently applied to our Credit Card after we had returned to the UK included a high season surcharge of
€91, assistance and environmental fees.
We were also charged €45 for a traffic violation, which Europcar have not been able to adequately provide details of.
Also prospective customers should be aware that if a vehicle is returned beyond the designated return time, an additional full days charges are likely to be applied.
So give yourself plenty of time to return the car, as you may be queuing for some time at the desk.
We were not be told about this deadline and potential additional levy, but got the car signed off within a minute of the cut off time.
All in all that was the only thing we were left to smile about with Europcar"
