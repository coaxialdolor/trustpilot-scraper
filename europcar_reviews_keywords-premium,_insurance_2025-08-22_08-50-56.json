      "text": "The booking.com website led me to Keddy by Europcar at Valencia airport in July with the promise of \"no queues\" but I had to wait more than 30 minutes to collect on arrival. I reserved a \"T-Roc or similar\" and tried to pre-empt me not getting \"or similar\" by contacting Europcar (Madrid) in advance. They responded with a \"we cannot promise anything\" and indeed when I arrived was given a Hyundai Tucson covered in scratches with a flogged engine 65k on the clock. Europcar then pre-authorised 800 Euros on my credit card in case of collision even though I had paid an extra 70 pounds to booking.com for full additional insurance (excess insurance). I hated the Hyundai Tucson. The safety features were infuriating with the parking brake auto-hold not having a light on the console and the locked patrol cap. The staff were very polite at Europcar Valencia airport but the experience was a let-down. One week after returning the car I noticed a further charge from Europcar on my credit card. When I contacted them they said it was an \"environmental contribution\" charged to me in error when it should have been charged to the intermediary (i.e. booking.com). Long story short I would avoid using either Europcar or booking.com for a car rental in the future."

      "text": "Daylight Robbery. Had to cancel my booking from Inverness Airport branch as my flight was cancelled . I foolishly hadn't checked every square millimetre of the website to find the 'refundable booking' button when I made the reservation so got charged the full value of the booking (£748.00) which included all the insurance waivers, extra driver even though clearly never used, surprised they didn't charge me for some fuel as well! In the end, we had to hire a car in Huntingdon and drive up to Scotland, and as Europcar had said they would refund me the full amount and didn't have a branch in Huntingdon, we used Enterprise - brilliant service, better car and cost £50 less anyway despite being a one-way hire with unlimited mileage. Will never use Europcar, ever."

      "text": "Scammers, extremely shady outfit.\n\nI picked up my car in Johannesburg and they tried to give me a car without a damage report, telling me “it will be fine”.\n\nUpon checking the car it had clearly been in some form of accident. It took an hour of refusing to take the car without damage report for them to finally say they would bring me a new car at my address later, but that I should take this one for now (I assume they then would have said the car was damaged by in the time between me taking it and them brining the new one).\n\nTravelling with a newborn, this was stressful and they eventually brought me a new car with a damage report and assured me that I had the maximum insurance. Unfortunately this was not the case as I was hit by a driver running a red light and Europcar took £2000 from me.\n\nBe careful, these guys are extremely shady."

      "text": "I am giving this Company a 1 star review, because I cannot give them any less.\nI was given a hire 'car' by my insurance company while mine was being repaired. I am nearly 70 and need a car to get around, so when my car went in for some repairs, the repair company stated that their courtesy cars were too small for me, (I am quite tall) Europcar were my insurers choice to give me a suitable car. They contacted me top say that they had not got an SUV as requested, but would give me something as close to an SUV as possible. What they supplied was a 9seater mini bus.\nI tried to contact them to explain that the 'car' was not suitable but every time I called, I was constantly put on hold. I even completed their contact us form only for them to send me a standard reply email 2 weeks after the van had been returned. Do not accept anything from this firm unless you are happy with the size of vehicle and the condition. make sure that you take an all round video just in case they try to con you for damage that you have not caused."

We had arranged our own insurance at a tenth of the price but they would not even look at the paperwork. It was late with only a few other companies open and limited availability. When I asked why the insurance was so high they said it was a local insurance company. Never given a policy document just €268 item on the bill. We still had to pay a deposit. Read other reviews and see this is a common scam by them."

      "text": "I had a prepaid car rental voucher for a predetermined type vehicle through a third-party provider. I went to collect the vehicle from EuropCar Gatwick South Terminal to be told by the female EuroCar employee that the vehicle we ordered was not available. She said “We are giving you a free upgrade”. No mention of cost we would pay etc. because we were told they were GIVING us an upgrade. GIVING! It is my understanding that under law, if the company cannot provide the car ordered (and paid for) they must offer either a free upgrade or a lesser vehicle with a monetary refund, The upgrade was a very luxurious vehicle and I was immediately resistant and anxious and expressed deep concern to her, I was told by the female agent not to worry, the vehicle was at the end of its rental life, it had 50,000 miles on the odometer, which it did, and it was to be disposed of when I returned it. Reluctantly I accepted it. I felt it had been foisted upon me. When I was outside loading the car, the female agent came out and said the car had damaged wheels and I had to sign a form to acknowledge the damage. She presented form with a diagram of the car, both sides, with X marks on the wheels. I now realise she had folded the paper in half so that I couldn’t see what was on the other side. I really thought the shonky, trickster days of car hire had long gone. Boy was I wrong!!!\nIn hindsight I should have said NO! NO! NO and I should have run away, screaming, and rung the third-party provider and complained, but I didn’t, fool that I am. However, after 26 hours of travel I was exhausted, and yes, I now know I was dimwitted not to spot a scam in the making.\nI hated the car from the start. This car wrecked my entire holiday and nearly wrecked me. I was highly anxious when I drove it and it made me quite ill from worry, It was too large and too wide for UK parking spaces. It literally got stuck in the entry to a shopping centre car park. It gave my daughter high level anxiety attacks. I had to try to park it away from other cars because I was terrified they would dent the car’s doors. This car was just too big,and too wide for UK narrow roads, even some A roads were scary and it did things I found hard to accept. It was so technical it was dangerous, simply because it was distracting.\nBut just as importantly, mechanically it was difficult. When the car started off there were many times when it just didn’t want to change up gears. Leaving Cobham Services, the car wouldn’t change gears at all and I held my breath thinking I would need a tow truck, but eventually it did change up. I am used to driving a Subaru with CVT automatic, but this vehicle had a habit of just stopping and not moving off. It would stop and go into Neutral and once you realised why the car wasn’t moving and what had happened, you had to go through the set process to get it going again. This happened in dangerous places at times like waiting to enter a large roundabout on a 70mph road. A friend suggested I return the car and I jolly well wish I had.\nOn the day I had to return the car to Gatwick, a yellow message about the tyres appeared on the consol. 8 calls to EuropCar proved useless and so I drove just down the road to the local dealership for the marque. Service personnel said it was ok to drive it back and gave me instructions as to what to do with the gadget in the trunk should tyre pressure deteriorate. And this is how I returned the car.\nDuring the term of the car hire I did check my credit card several times to see if EuropCar had levied the £1500 block for security and I was surprised they had not. I returned the car on 1 August and flew home. The day after I arrived home, I checked my credit card and found that at between the 29 July and 9 August (8 days after I had returned the car) EuropCar had charged me $3,630.06 in my money for the upgrade they told me they were GIVING me because they were unable to supply the car I had ordered and prepaid for. It was then that I remembered the woman who asked me to sign the document acknowledging the damage to the car, and it was then that I realised she had folded the document in half and therefore I could not see what was on the other side-the upgrade charges etc.What a Fool I am\nI have lodged a dispute but EuropCarUK is notorious for completely ignoring disputes. I am told that what this woman did could be a criminal offence called Fraudulent Misrepresentation. Some could ask whether she is highly skilled in the dark arts of duplicity and deception? Of course I will not be letting this matter go and others in the travel and insurance industries have been advised. Eventually when I can confidently tell the Citizens Advice Bureau,Trading Standards,Watchdog and Rip-off Britain that EuropCar has done absolutely nothing to resolve my dispute,then I will lodge a dispute with the BVRLA to whom EuropCar belong."

      "text": "I’m extremely disappointed with Europcar. When I picked up my car at Birmingham Airport, I clearly declined additional protection cover, as I had already purchased my own insurance.\nDespite this, I was still charged £281.57 for an extra package I never agreed to. The agent made no effort to explain the charges, and I only realised later when the amount appeared on my invoice.\nThis feels like a deliberate upsell — especially knowing that staff may be incentivised to add extras. Europcar refused to refund me, so I’ve had to escalate to the BVRLA and my credit card provider.\nAvoid unless you're prepared to challenge everything at the desk."

But after returning the car, I was charged again for: Licenses and Fees &\nPremium Station Surcharge\n\nEuropcar claimed these were “not charged again,” just shown again. Yet, £214.41 was deducted from my credit card — part of which they admit was £180.18 for Roadside Assistance, which I never intended to buy. That leaves £34.23 unexplained.\n\n2️⃣ Misleading Upselling\nDespite already having full insurance, I was pressured to buy Roadside Assistance at pickup. The staff explicitly told me it would not cost extra and was “included in the basic insurance.” This is clearly false and designed to exploit tourists unfamiliar with UK rental terms.\n\n3️⃣ Admin Fees Without Proof\nCharged £45 per “admin fee” for supposed fines or tolls — yet no evidence or notice was ever provided.\n\n❗ Avoid Europcar. It will give you nothing but a deeply unpleasant experience. Nothing else."

After I booked the car in the UK, I phoned Europcar and asked if they sold damage waiver Insurance (I normally buy it separately online). I was told that it wasn't necessary as all their cars were fully covered under the rental agreement. At the Faro desk, I agreed to pay for a vehicle upgrade, and they asked me for a large amount of deposit to cover damage. Realising that I did need damage waiver, I told them I was just going buy the damage waiver online for £42 for the 8 days i needed. The desk staff said they would sell it to me for £24, so I accepted. When my credit card bill came through, they had charged me £24 a day! They also charged me around an extra £50 to collect the car! I have phoned and written to complain, but they don't care. Of course they don't - it's their way of operating - deceitfuly. I'm really dissapointed, I thought they were a reputable company 😔"

This was UNTIL the rep realised we had purchased fully comprehensive insurance and that both husband and wife would be driving. The key was swiftly removed from us and we were handed keys to a Dacia Sandero. All I can say is that this car looked like it had been owned by a succession of learner drivers. There were scratches and dents everywhere and the car wasnt particularly clean inside. The tyres were barely legal and in a bad state for the dusty roads. Total deception on our side as we paid over £500 for this experience (and were parked next to the shiny new Peugeot we were meant to be picking up).

      "text": "I was told it's now IMPOSSIBLE to book a small car from Glasgow, unless you pay extra. I'm a Europcar regular - I'm looking at my online record and I see ten rentals in the last two and a bit years. These are private retals, spanning Portgal, France, Germany, Spain and the UK.\nI booked a Compact car ('Cupra Leon or similar' - that's a small hatchback. As on my last trip to Scotland, I was instead given a dreadful, wallowy, absolutely huge MG SUV. I asked for a smaller car at the desk, and was told I could have a BMW 1 series - for an extra £30 a day. I was told it's not possible to get the car I asked for without going premium - instead I had to put up with a bloated, rubbishy Chinese SUV.\nTo make things worse, the car stank of cigarettes - some previous user had been smoking in it. I complained before I drove away, and it was recorded (so I wouldn't have to pay for the damage - probably impossible to clean effectively) but I wasn't offered a change of vehicle.\nStill, at least there wasn't a queue. On two receent trips - to Toulouse in France in June, and to Portugal in April - I had to queue for more than an hour to collect the keys. There's no 'Privilege' desk any more for regular customers - no reward for customer loyalty, for filling out details in advance to speed things up. No, you queue with all the people who need every last comma on the contract explained to them, while staff try their hardest to up-sell. EVERY. STUPID. TIME.\nAnyway I'm getting utterly fed up with Europcar, I noted that queues at some other rental places are much shorter. I don't know if Hertz or Avis have a functioning loyalty programme but I might give them a try.\nI moved to the Europcar app after using brokers for years, after two unforunate experiences (with Greenmotion in Edinburgh, and Goldcar in Italy - the latter now ironically a Europcar brand) where I was ripped off for non-existent damage I didn't do. I have a global excess policy that I use everywhere from the US to Taiwan and Japan, as well as across Europe. But these two were the only times it's been triggered. To be fair, Europcar haven't ripped me off in this way. It's a credible brand. But customer service has not recovered from COVID and it seems it may well be time to move on."

Later, I realised that the excess insurance which I had been told was included was an added extra (cover I didn't need) and I also realised that I should have been offered a one-way hire for one day, rather than being given a cancellation of my week's hire at Carcassonne and a new hire one-way hire from Toulouse for the week at a cost of some €600 more.\n\nNo apology from Eurocar. Just a \"tough luck, you signed\". They'll not get that chance again from me, even if they're the cheapest option."

When making the booking I added full insurance through the booking agent Discover cars and the supplier being keddy (AKA Europcar).\nAt the desk the lady verbally said she could see I had insurance so all was good, I paid the deposit.\nIt wasn’t until I looked at the invoice at home and saw a charge for premium insurance which had been added on top of the full cover insurance I had already purchased online. The premium insurance added was for £274. I immediately phoned Europcar, they told me they couldn’t do anything til after the car had been returned. So I emailed them once I had returned the car and keys to the out of office box.\nThis was in February. I have formally complained 3? times now. And nothing. I left a review on Google and Europcar just sent me the link to complain, the same link I’ve used several times already with no response.\nI’ve seen lots of other Google reviews where people have been in the same situation as me. They just seem like an absolute scam of a company. And then actually ignore you when you try and pull them up on it. AVOID EUROPCAR."

None of it made sense, and it was clear the car was never going to arrive on time.\n\nThe most frustrating part was the lack of honesty and the rude attitude. Eventually, the car was cancelled without informing us—we only found out through our insurance.\n\nExtremely poor communication, no accountability, and unnecessarily stressful—especially for an elderly customer.

When we alerted the staff they brought out a booster seat for a 4 year old plus and before we could raise concerns the man literally ran off and we had to leave the car park due to other cars trying to leave and blocking up the car park.Them they said you agreed to pay the extra insurance which was flung on us at a busy desk with a queue of people in a foreign country!\nSo for our holiday for 8 days we had to drive with our daughter in a seat belt which is completely illegal and unsafe and restate the work unsafe !\nDue to this we didn’t drive 80 % of the holiday which we had planned to .\nAnd still when I rang up customer service about all this when home they just brushed off the safety of our child as we have no evidence of the car seat and there is nothing we could do…. Surely they had the 2 car seats in there depot so surely that would be evidence enough.\nThe fact that we paid money to Europacar pre booked our child seat and car and they didn’t have the safety equipment of the car seat to keep our child safe is outrageous.\nAnd then to be told we can not do anything about this is a sneaky and unsafe way to do business.\nI would like to see if I rented a car and child seat for one of their children and rush them out of the car park and see how they would feel.\nI would never use Europacar ever again unsafe unprofessional and sneaky aswell in the end .\nTake your money and provide an unsafe service disgusting."

Without going into all the details here, they basically accused me of lying. I wrote many emails of complaint but they still charged me £195 for a tyre. I had taken insurance with a different company because it was cheaper but honestly I have never known any company to have such little regard towards their customers. From start to finish with company, I would go as far to say that they are the worst company of any company I have ever experienced.\nThe dashboard said there was a low tyre as I was leaving the depot, so I had a quick look and judged that none looked low to the eye, and just thought I’d keep an eye on it and pump it up myself to get it to the correct level. According to them, I should have checked all the tyres for screws and nails before leaving. Are you serious? I drove home and left it on the drive over night. In the morning it was nearly completely flat. I drove to a petrol station to pump it up noticed a screw in the tyre. I called them and was told to take it back to the depot. I did this, and I was told to take to Kwik Fit. I was also told it would be free as it wasn’t my fault. The apparently have no recollection of this. Their customer service have been terribly rude, and condescending, and any emails I have sent have not been personable in any way. No apology for my bad experience due to their incompetencies."

      "text": "I wish to provide a candid warning to those contemplating the prospect of hiring from this company, particularly with regard to their Heathrow branch. This caution is underscored by a significant volume of negative reviews available online, and my experience is not isolated.\n\nDuring my interaction with the Heathrow location, I was subjected to charges exceeding £200, categorised as a Premium Station surcharge. This fee is levied despite the availability of other provincial alternatives within a reasonable taxi or cab fare of approximately £20. Furthermore, I was charged for Super Premium Personal Accident Cover, which is redundant as I possess my own comprehensive annual coverage with premiums totalling less than the cost of their two-week charge. Additionally, their breakdown cover was almost twice the cost of a standard RAC or AA annual policy for annual duration.\n\nRegrettably, I discovered these exorbitant charges only upon receipt of my invoice, as none of these fees were disclosed to me in advance. I strongly advise prospective customers to explore numerous online options for car hire excess cover provided by various insurers, which are available at a fraction of the costs imposed by this company. It is prudent to exercise caution; these charges are often hidden until after the transaction.\n\nMy attempts to rectify the situation were met with a lack of accountability. I engaged with a representative named Monica at a Spanish call centre, who assured me that the matter would be investigated. However, after a five-day interval, I was informed that no action had been taken, and I was told that Monica would face internal disciplinary measures.\n\nAlthough a decision was made to refund my charges, I was subsequently informed that the process would take five days due to the sum exceeding their operational limits, necessitating approval from the UK. This was further compounded by a call handler abruptly ending our conversation when I sought clarification, stating that they were restricted in the length of calls. Once approval was secured, I was told that an additional ten days would be required for the funds to reach my account.\n\nThis level of indifference displayed by their representatives is striking, particularly in light of how they would likely respond if the roles were reversed and they were in a similar predicament. My experience has been distressing, exacerbating my PTSD with multiple triggers stemming from their deceptive practices.\n\nI encourage anyone who has previously rented from this company to reassess their charges. Even years later, with the appropriate documentation, claims may be pursued in the County Court. To summarise:\n\n1. Avoid utilising the Heathrow location.\n2. Scrutinise all charges, regardless of the duration of your rental.\n3. Research supplementary services available from various providers online.\n4. Review competitor options thoroughly, paying particular attention to customer feedback.\n\nProtect yourself and make informed decisions."

Had we known this in advance and read the reviews, we would never have gone ahead with the booking.\n\nUpon arriving at Verona Airport, we eventually located the Europcar desk, and that’s when everything began to go wrong. The staff member at the desk was very insistent that we purchase additional insurance, despite the fact that we had already bought full protection through Auto Europe. Even after I phoned Auto Europe and they confirmed we were fully covered, the staff member continued to push the insurance, making us feel pressured and uncomfortable.\n\nWhen we were finally given the keys, we discovered that the car provided was completely different from what we had booked. We had reserved a VW Tiguan or similar SUV specifically to fit our passengers and luggage, but were given a saloon instead. I returned to the desk, where I was told that SUVs and saloons fall into the same category. I contacted Auto Europe again, and after speaking with the Europcar desk staff, they informed me that nothing could be done as Europcar uses a different classification system than Auto Europe.\n\nEventually, a more suitable car was located, but we were told we’d have to wait 30 minutes while it was cleaned. In reality, we waited far longer — not an ideal start to a long-awaited holiday.\n\nThe car we were eventually given wasn't in the greatest condition, but at least it could accommodate both our group and our luggage and done the job. Still, the overall experience was disorganised, frustrating, and disappointing.\n\nWe left feeling exhausted before our trip had even begun.

After being told there's no complaints department, we're close to giving up. There are plenty of other car rental companies, please avoid this one."

      "text": "I rented a van from Europcar, and the experience was nothing short of disgraceful. The attendant at the reception was not just rude — she was downright hostile. She repeatedly pressured me to accept unnecessary add-ons and even went so far as to suggest I’d likely end up in an accident for declining the additional insurance excess reduction. That kind of fearmongering is completely unacceptable. She asked the same intrusive questions multiple times — “How far are you going?” “When exactly are you bringing it back?” — in a tone that made me feel like I was begging to borrow her personal vehicle rather than paying to rent from a major company. The whole exchange was uncomfortable, condescending, and frankly, humiliating. At one point, I was so taken aback by her attitude, I genuinely considered walking away and telling her to keep the van. Renting a vehicle shouldn’t feel like being interrogated or talked down to. If this is how Europcar treats paying, polite customers — then count me out for good. I wouldn’t recommend this branch to anyone. Absolutely dreadful service."

I had booked a decent car, and they handed me a wreck – filthy, falling apart, and barely drivable. It looked like it belonged in a junkyard. An absolute disgrace.\n\nI had purchased full insurance coverage, so I wasn’t supposed to be charged for anything. Still, they held a deposit of £125, which was initially released, and then they took the money from my account after I had already left, with no explanation. That’s not a mistake – that’s outright theft.\n\nThis is not just poor service – it’s dishonest and unethical. Europcar in Tunis is running a scam. What they’re doing is not car rental, it’s abuse and legalized robbery.\n\nAvoid this company at all costs. I wouldn’t wish this experience on anyone."

We ended up paying €1000 for a basic 208 Peugeot which on their website was €300 when we initially paid for it. They also scammed us with €200 for a 3cm scuff on the wheel which was there before we rented the car, I showed the picture to them and the representative said I shouldn’t worry because it’s covered by the insurance (this was of course a lie) but they just need to record it for the next rental. They then also billed €87 for the damage admin fee. Be prepared to never see your deposit back and once you return the car if you don’t have a credit card then make sure you move the money from your account as they will just start charging random amounts to your debit card. Make sure you email all photos and videos and detailed description 1hr after you get the car as otherwise they won’t care what photos or videos you have. They lie, scam and steal and add secret charges that you didn’t ask for. We didn’t ask for roadside assistance and somehow it showed up on the invoice. There’s also a massive airport fee which they don’t tell you about in advance. Every price they say is without VAT, which they forget to mentioned. Do yourself a favour and find a local/family owned company outside of the airport and never go near Europcar as you will be robbed. Hopefully someone will eventually win a legal case against them."

      "text": "Edit 26 May: It is impossible to get hold of anyone on the phone or via email. It all looks professional but there is ZERO customer service. Do not go near this company.\n\nFor a 6 day hire my bill so far is gbp 400 plus deposit. I feel totally ripped off. I have not been able to drive the car because a tyre had 2 holes in it and no one was interested in resolving the problem. I have been stuck in one place waiting for repairs to be done. There was no spare tyre.\nI went through Rentalcar.com which is a broker. I was in a difficult situation and had to hire in a hurry for a next day, Saturday, start. I requested a Leeds city pick up and Manchester airport drop off on Thursday. I was charged 233gbp, then 85gbp extra when I went to pick up the car because the ‘different drop off location’ had ‘dropped off’. Plus a deposit which was ok and expected, if large. There was another extra charge for road usage when I picked up the vehicle. Prices are advertised in GBP but my UK credit card was charged in NZ dollars - I’m using an NZ mobile phone and drivers license but there was no obvious option to change the currency quoted/charged in. So then the insurance cover was added - the wording strongly suggests you need their full insurance offer. This was £65 for 6 days. Charging my UK credit card in NZ$ incurred four times unnecessary conversion fees. By now I’m committed and don’t have time (or energy because I’m dealing with a family emergency and really need a good reliable car, right now) to find another supplier so accepted the deal.\nI booked a 10am pick up. There was a 15’ wait before being able to begin completing the paperwork and pick up the car. The car itself is ungroomed in the interior, and didn’t drive well from the get go. Shortly after leaving the pick up point an alarm appeared saying ‘tyre pressure low’. I did not have time to deal with this immediately. When I called Europcar (the end supplier) two days later, by which time the wheel alignment feels obviously wrong, I waited a very long time for an answer and was eventually shunted through to someone who turned out to be the AA who came out to check the car through their breakdown service. Whilst the AA is always great, I could have called them on my own membership and saved the 30 minutes + waiting for Europcar to answer. So at this point I had no usable car (for which I’ve paid a very expensive total hire rate) and was stuck waiting for a roadside rescue service to help me out with ‘my’ problem. The AA turned up as promised an hour later, removed a nail ‘which has been in there a long time’, did a temporary fix so I could get to some local appointments early the next day (having by now not been able to get to that day’s necessary hospital visit and run other urgent medical-related errands), and booked a new tyre service Kwikfit who replaced the tyre the next day. They found another nail in the tyre and let slip that poor quality tyres on loaned-out vehicles are a common problem with Europcar vehicles. The worst part of this is that Europcar do not answer the phone and even when they do couldn’t give a damn. When I did eventually get through to a customer service agent she was smugly rude by just meeting my concerns with deliberate silence. She finally put me through to ‘the local branch’ (an ad loop telling lies about how great Europcar is) which clearly no one answers) where I was on hold over 30’ before I gave up. Worst customer experience ever. Will never use rentalcar.com or Europcar ever again."

This staff, who is on duty, confirmed he could wait up to 30 minutes beyond the usual closing time – until 11:30 PM. We expressed our deep appreciation in phone.\nBefore making the car booking, we contacted your Customer Service team to clarify what would happen in the event of a flight delay, given that your office hours end at 11:00 PM. We were assured that, as long as we provided our flight number, your staff would monitor our arrival and wait for us accordingly. Based on this reassurance, we proceeded with the booking and submitted our flight information\nWe explained our situation and referenced the prior conversation with that staff. However, he remained adamant. When we requested an official policy document justifying this charge, he became defensive, accused us of being impolite, and refused to provide any documentation. He then stated that unless we paid the fee, he would close the office and WITHOUHOLD the car.\nAdding to our discomfort, before demanding the late fee, this staff spent over five minutes trying to upsell us additional insurance. We informed him that we had already purchased full coverage. He replied confidently—but misleadingly—that full coverage did not include wheels and tires, and pressured us to purchase more coverage. When we declined, his attitude changed abruptly, and he immediately brought up the “After Hours” charge.\nLastly, when we arrived at 11:04 PM, the staff member had just finished completing the documentation for the previous customer. He was not simply waiting in the office for serving us.\nI fully agree that flight delay was not Europcar’s fault and was not their responsible for this either.\nHowever, they did not keep promise and still charged us after failing to sell us insurance, simply because we were only 4 minutes late.\nThey not only refused to issue a refund, but also failed to provide any documentation justifying the 'late charge' as per their Terms and Conditions\nPlease think carefully before ordering a car from them, even if their initial prices seem cheaper."

Otherwise they will try to take you for all you’re worth.\n\nThat’s without even mentioning the lack of care, they are supposed to come out and show you the car’s features, how to use it, etc.\nMine was an EV which I had never used before, he just gave me the keys and sent me on my way.\n\nOverall extremely negative experience."

We had never hired a vehicle before & could almost see ££s signs in the rep's eyes when he asked us. My husband did ask if the car we had booked had a Sat Nav system (Ford Focus or similar booked via Booking.com) & were told that only new electric cars had these. He then went into back office & bought out 2 sets of keys for a Hyundai Kona & a Volvo car - no sign of our original request!! After being bombarded with insurance information & other additional charges told that the insurance already taken out with Booking.com was useless, so told to take out their additional insurance - even charged more for the One-Way charge than anticipated - altogether had to pay an additional £400 for a car we didn't request or need!!! We weren't even shown to the car or shown around the vehicle to check for any damage & it was getting dark by the time we finished with the reams of paperwork. We didn't even know how to start the car initially & had to figure out how to operate the Sat Nav ourselves! The final figure on the Rental Agreement was deducted from my husband's bank account but then adjusted after leaving the Desk. All in all - a totally traumatic experience, which was unexpected & we left shell-shocked. I think the staff are trained to confuse customers into signing up for additional services that they do not want or need. I think that they make customers feel cheap & uneducated if they question the explanation for additional services. I wouldn't recommend this company to my worst enemy. I contacted Booking.com with these details and think they are aware of their practices as they refunded the insurance that I took with them without any questions & advised that the deposit (which we didn't know would be deducted either) would be returned within 28 days but not much else. PLEASE DO NOT HIRE VEHICLES FROM THEM - we will never ever use them."

I paid nearly £80 for the pleasure, along with a £100 deposit and £36 insurance upgrade. The collection process was simple and straight forward, and the bloke who helped me was nice. However, I was told I would need to leave the van in a nearby carpark when I was done with it, as there was no where else to leave it out of hours, but that it would be picked up at 1pm on the Sunday (the following day). Fair enough, although it would have been useful to know this upon booking. I dropped the van off 3 hours before my rental period ended at 7pm on the Saturday, and paid for the parking until the next day (as advised by the staff member) for 12 hours at nearly £8. I received a return statement and invoice on the Monday to say that I was being charged an additional £114.45 as I didn’t hand the car back until the Monday! I contacted customer via phone and email, and sent proof of my drop off, the carpark receipt and all additional info I had to and they essentially fobbed me off and told me it was my fault and that I had indeed dropped the car off on the Monday. They explicitly said I had been charged correctly. They then stopped replying to my emails. I phoned the branch where I hired the van from and they accepted that they had wrongly charged me BUT it took almost 4 weeks to get my money back, and in total I spoke to 6 different people who were useless at helping me. I kept being told ‘it should be with you soon, call back in 2 days’. Overall, a horrific service and unless you push and press them, they are reluctant to accept fault and refund you. I didn’t get one apology during this experience. DO NOT USE THEM."

Booked the van from 10:00am-22:00pm on Saturday and was charged £71.45 which I thought was fairly reasonable. Noticed when booking that a charge would be added after as I would be returning the van out of hours. I called Europcar to ask how much this charge would be and was told £20. I asked for this info to be emailed to me in case they tried to charge more later. They said they couldn't provide this info in writing which made me nervous but I needed to go ahead with the booking. The next day (Friday) I had a phone call from them saying that the van I had booked was not available but they could offer me a smaller one. I declined as had to move a sofa. They said it was OK and they would make sure the van was available for my booking the next day. Saturday we arrived at Europcar at 10am but there was nowhere to park at all - it was a tiny site with cars/vans everywhere. I ended up dropping off my partner and parking at the shop down the street. He was waiting for about 15 minutes till he got served and was told the van wasn't ready. He had already checked in online but they wanted all of his details again. Clearly they needed to waste time as the van wasn't ready. They asked for the payment card so I had to go back and provide this, they made a comment to my partner saying something along the lines of 'we will cancel this whole thing off until she gets here and then start again' - my partner said 'no that is not necessary she is parked 30 seconds away - keep it on the screen she will be here now'. I arrived and they took all of my details and tried to sell me insurance. I said that the basic will be fine as we are travelling very local. They proceeded to try and scaremonger me into taking the insurance but I said no. At this point it was about 11am and they were cleaning the van. I said that I want a discount as the van wasn't ready 1 hour after my booking time. They said as a gesture of goodwill that I could have the van until the following day. I said this is no use to me, I am doing 1 trip - I want you to waive the £20 key drop-off out of hours fee and they said they would 'try'. So far, I haven't been charged this but wouldn't be surprised if it comes out of my account in the next few days. Would not recommend at all. Problem at every stage. Should have read reviews before booking. Even if you're in dire need I would go elsewhere."

No point of impact so was obviously caused by the cold weather which is common in weakly manufactured screens. Sure enough searching the car make and cracked windscreen shows other drivers had this problem. Despite there being no impact damage, no surrounding scratches etc just a clean crack they are insisting its damage not a defect. They are asking for £900. I did take out insurance elsewhere but they wont cover manufacturing defects. Complete lack of care from them means I wont be using them in the future."

The staff at the car return looked over the car and didn't raise any issue. I then received a damage notification followed by a £100 bill for a 'light scuff' on one wheel, (which wasn't caused by me). I was shown no proof that this was not there before my rental and as much as I did check the car for dents/scrapes on the doors, bumpers etc (Bearing in mind it was dark at almost 11pm at night when I collected the car), I did not get down on my hands and knees with a torch to check the car tyres, if I had done I would have seen that this 'light scuff' was already there. At the time of returning the car I signed the tablet with no mention of any damage by staff even after they had walked around and inspected the car.\nI contacted customer services and was simply told that 'any damage needed to have been reported before hand'. Will never use this company again and strongly advise others to avoid as I feel I have been victimised and ripped off for failing to take out additional insurance."

But Europcar then ask you to fully cover the car with a credit card - in my case, 1800Euros which if you don't have a credit card it's more on a debit card- around another 25euros a day. It was exhausting - the operative at Europcar also said she had never heard of DiscoverCars - even though the bus was outside with both their logos on and if you Google them - they say they are partners!

This third party admitted responsibility and I filed a damage report following Europcars instructions. They had all the details of the driver causing the damage and I assumed that was the end of the issue. However, sometime later I received a claim for payment of the damage from Europcar. I explained the situation but they had no record of my damage report. The alarm bells should have started ringing then. I had to pay the 850 pounds damages, while they claimed the money from the driver responsible and I have still not been refunded some 8 months later. I have been passed from department to department, emailing on average once a month to try and resolve the issue. The driver that caused the damage has told me his insurance company case number and as far as he is concerned the matter is closed and his insurance has paid, but I have not received any money. I will continue to email Europcar, but I am wondering if I will ever get my money back. The only thing I am sure of, is that I will definitely think twice before renting with them again!\n\nGuess what? I contacted customer services and according to them the case was closed!! I have been instructed to email them again. Feel like I am banging my head against a brick wall!!!"

At no point when I was sorting the new tyre did they say I was liable for a slow puncture and they have been totally unreasonable. They refused to complete a fault check on the car to show when the tyre pressure fault was initially recorded on the car and seem to think that a slow puncture would be obvious within 24 hours. If you ever are in the unfortunate position of having to deal with this awful company then accept they will screw you over and send you a bill for £180 for one tyre. I did the right thing and got the tyre changed even though I could easily have just pumped it up and handed it back to them and then they would have had to sort it which is what they did to me. No common sense and a an absolute rip off. Also told that this is classed as insurance claim, I hope the useless complaints person is wrong about this as it is totally ridiculous.

The total rental amount was £91.00, and an additional £50.00 was paid for waiver protection. (Supporting details attached.)\n\nInitial Interaction at Rental Counter\nUpon arrival to collect the car, the representative at the counter inquired whether I had rented with Europcar previously. I informed them that I had, but had a negative experience regarding fuel charges, despite refueling the car minutes before returning it. I was forced to raise a complaint and provide proof of my fuel purchase in order to receive a refund. The representative apologized and offered me a free upgrade for my current rental.\n\nRental Agreement and Holding Deposit\nI was presented with the rental agreement, which clearly indicated the prepaid amount of £91.00, as well as an additional charge of £86.90, which was explained to me as a holding deposit. I questioned this charge, and it was reaffirmed as a holding deposit, which would be refunded to my card upon the return of the vehicle. This conversation was witnessed by my colleague, who was traveling with me at the time.\n\nFuel Refill and Return of Vehicle\nPrior to returning the vehicle, I refueled the car with 6.91 liters of petrol, totalling £9.66, at the nearest garage to the airport (PA3 2TH), as per the attached receipt. Upon returning the vehicle, I handed the keys to a Europcar representative named Jack, who inspected the vehicle, including its mileage and fuel levels. He confirmed that everything was in order and that no issues were present.\n\nUnjust Charges\nOn March 21, 2025, I received an invoice for additional charges, including a Premium Station Surcharge and a charge for 6 liters of fuel. Furthermore, my credit card has been charged an additional £98.85 on top of the original rental charge of £91.00.\n\nThese charges are clearly erroneous, unjustified, and appear to be fraudulent.\n\nI hereby request that the excess charge of £98.85 be refunded immediately to my credit card.\n\nAdditionally, I wish to file a formal complaint against both the employee who processed my rental and the representative to whom I returned the vehicle. Their actions were misleading and resulted in fraudulent charges being placed against me.\n\nI expect prompt resolution of this matter. Should this issue remain unresolved, I will be forced to take further action to protect my interests."

Had this been made clear, I would have declined or opted for full insurance, which would have been a far better choice. Instead, I was rushed into signing multiple documents without any real explanation.\n\nEven worse, I was charged over £200 for a faulty tyre that developed a bubble after just 215 miles over 8 days—something that shouldn’t happen with a properly maintained vehicle. This raises serious concerns about Europcar’s safety standards. It seems that Europcar relies on renters purchasing insurance to cover defective or substandard parts, knowing they can shift the cost to insurance companies rather than ensuring vehicles are well-maintained. Those who decline extra coverage are left footing the bill for Europcar’s own negligence.\n\nHoping for fair treatment, I escalated this to BVRLA, expecting them to step in. But rather than questioning Europcar’s practice of shifting costs onto customers, BVRLA chose to focus only on Europcar’s paperwork, avoiding any real attempt to hold them accountable. This approach allows Europcar to continue misleading and overcharging customers without consequences.\n\nRenters deserve better—clear terms, properly maintained vehicles, and fair business practices. Not hidden charges, misleading explanations, and financial penalties for defects that aren’t their fault."

I booked a car for my family trip from 20th December 2024 to 20th January 2025 and paid in full (GBP 1,639.81) upfront. However, the problems began as soon as I arrived at the Gatwick Airport North Terminal after a 30-hour flight from Brisbane.\n\nDespite explicitly informing the staff that I did not require additional insurance because I have Allianz Travel Insurance covering rental car excess, I was handed a document to sign under the pretense of providing a security deposit. Later, I discovered it was a completely new rental agreement with added charges for unwanted insurance and a so-called \"free upgrade\" to a Peugeot PG5008. The upgrade was presented as complimentary because the originally booked MG HS was unavailable, yet I was later charged for it.\n\nUpon returning the car at Heathrow Airport, I was unexpectedly charged GBP 20 for cleaning without prior disclosure. The staff claimed it was because the car floor required more than five minutes to clean. This charge was never mentioned in the rental agreement.\n\nAfter returning to Australia, I discovered an unauthorized charge of AUD 3,889.19 on my credit card, labeled as a second rental payment. I immediately contacted Europcar but received only an automated response. Despite multiple follow-ups, I was given no proper explanation or resolution.\n\nTo make matters worse, I noticed additional unexplained charges of GBP 45 each on 12th and 13th February 2025. Again, these charges were processed without my consent and with no justification provided.\n\nThis experience has highlighted Europcar's lack of transparency, misleading practices, and poor customer service. I strongly advise others to avoid Europcar if they want a stress-free and honest rental experience."

I was forced into signing the contract as I had a pre-booked place on a ferry and no time to argue about it. No-one with enough English to explain. No come back from customer services. Total cost during my holiday €4 per kilometre.AVOID, AVOID, AVOID\n\nOh yes - and pay no heed to their reply below.

After returning the vehicle I noticed on my invoice that an extra charge of amount £223.04 has been applied to my bank account (in the name of 'Premium protection'). I never asked to add any additional service on top of the booking amount of £ 327.35 which was paid already at the time of booking (before even using the rental service). If I need any additional services, I always make sure that everything is in place and paid for to avoid any surprises and to keep a track of by expense and budget.\nI clearly mentioned \"NO\" multiple times for any additional services to Europe car rental agent (It must be recorded on their camera).\nEven when I said \"NO\" multiple times to any kind of additional services, Europcar's agent printed 'Premium protection agreement' papers without informing me and put in front of me to get my signature with other many agreement documents which is really deceiving and manipulating the valuable customer and forcing unnecessary extra charges to the customers while they are trusting the process. When I explained the situation to them and asked for refund, they denied. Never ever going to book from them. I request you all to avoid such shameless deceivers instead of getting deceived."

The other people that also did the same as me, trying to collect their car, where also being fleeced by Europcar. I raised this on Facebook and Europcar requested I take this issue off Facebook and they would sort it out for me. If they offer this, do not believe them.. This is all a con. Never use them they are crocked.\nI tried the customer service who sounded like they would try and help. They asked a lot of questions and then went to sleep.

They bought the car outside and I asked for the existing damages report on the car that I was not provided with and I’ve been told that they are aware of all damages and I will not get charged for them. I took a video of the car in many angles that saved me probably paying over 1000£ in damages fees.\nOn drop off the guy looked around the car for 1 minute the came to me and said that everything is ok and I will receive my deposit back in 4-5 days, I left and then the scammer went back to the car took photos of 2 scratches and added them to the drop off report and said that they were new ones. I never found out until one week later when I received an email from europcar with the claim against me for 2 scratches on the car. I asked for the drop off report and I couldn’t believe when I saw the pictures of the scratches in the drop off report.\nI cannot stress enough telling you how important it is to have videos and photos taken on the start of a hire as they will do everything they can to take some money off you.\n\nBe safe 👍🏻"

I asked why the car I had fully paid wasn't available but got no answer instead the guy would go and talk to his colleagues and then come back trying to make small talk.

We booked a car online (medium sized) via Booking.com\nWhen we arrived (jet lagged & exhausted after the long flight from Australia), the guy said that the car we had booked wouldn't serve our purposes as we were doing a lot of driving. As per another review, you're a target because you're tired and you just want to get a car and get going.\nLong story short: we ended being \"upgraded\" (supposedly at some discounted cost), but out of pocket an extra GBP1400!! In hindsight, my husband made the observation that when we were talking to the guy about our booking, he had 3 sets of keys in front of him. We figure (in hindsight), that one set was the car we actually booked, the second was a slight upgrade and the third was the set for suckers like us. And, like another reviewer, the upsell about insurance: no, what we had paid for online was not of any use, blah, blah. Then, when we finally get out to the car and ask for some help with how it all operates , they send out some young guy who knew little more than us. We got absolutely NO help working out how to get the GPS to work - when you put in an intended address, after a minute the screen would disappear and the message would come up, something along the lines of \"You need to pay a subscription\". What??? After a week of using our own data on our 'phones due to this limitation (and stopping in at two more car hire offices to try and get help with it, without success), we discovered if we went through another field/screen, the map displayed would actually stay live and not disappear. Fancy having to work that out for yourself, and having the frustration of that limitation for a week, when the company can't help you. (No car manual in the car).\nAlso, like other reviewers, I WISH I HAD READ THESE REVIEWS BEFORE BOOKING!! Additionally, in talking to a friend, she had the same type of pressure to upgrade (although she stuck to her guns) with this company in NEW ZEALAND. This must be part of their policy and company training!! Maybe they get commission if they upsell?\nWould NEVER rent through them again."

      "text": "Our experience with Europcar turned out to be the most expensive and frustrating car rental we've ever had.\n\nWe chose Europcar because their website advertised the Volvo C40. However, upon arrival, the promised car was unavailable. The pick-up process was extremely slow, taking about an hour just to verify ID and address. This delay forced us to reschedule our plans, turning an already busy day into a stressful nightmare.\n\nThroughout the process, we felt bombarded with additional charges. They attempted to add fees for a \"popular pickup location,\" premium protection, and even cleaning—despite us already paying for extensive protection coverage.\n\nHere are some of the key issues we faced:\n\n1. The verification procedure took about an hour. This unnecessary delay disrupted our schedule and caused significant stress.\n\n2. As advised, we paid extra premium protection for the alternative car, thinking it was only a day of use and a premium service would give us ease of mind.\n\n3. While some loose dog hair ended up on our coats and my wife’s trousers, it was minimal. Despite this, Europcar insisted on specialist cleaning, claiming it was required for such a minor issue. We know firsthand that dog hair can be removed quickly with a vacuum and they provide standard cleaning for customers—it certainly doesn’t justify specialist cleaning fees. Plus we used other rental services and this was never an issue\n\n4. The rental was advertised at approximately £120, yet by the end, we were charged over £200 for just one day of use. We ultimately had to involve Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) to contest the cleaning fee.\n\nRegardless of the ADR outcome, we will never use Europcar again and strongly advise others to avoid their service. Renting from Europcar resulted in wasted time, unexpected stress, and substantial additional costs. And please save your reply by saying we need to send an email to your customer service team. We just got their reply. They said it was the final decision to use specialist cleaning service to remove some loose dog hair."

Very suspicious.\n\nThey then refused to remove that price with a customer service agent who presumably was provided by Little Britain.\n\nIn addition, there was a hidden charge for a \"premium\" drop-off location, which was not in the original agreement or detailed at collection.\n\nI'll soon to be making my feelings clear to over five million users on social media.\n\nAvoid this misleading, fraudulent company which does not value customers and would rather charge for a 53-minute delay in which THEY caused.\n\nYou should, though, perhaps also feel bad for Europcar because they are so desperate for money they insist on charging £25 incorrectly than settle this issue.\n\n* Edit: Europcar have responded to this review informing me to contact customer service. Which I have already done. And which they would already know if they had read my review. Further compounding their uselessness by proving they literally do not listen to what the customer has said."

Sure ok that's a good deal to me. To my surprise when I return and review my credit card bill I have 2 charges. 1 from easycar and 1 from Europcar, total 400 more than the price I signed up for when I booked. What a scam.

At least the other rental companies I have used from Manchester airport have never done anything like this.\n\nUpdated in response to your comment below: I had raised it on email already and it remains unresolved. You informed me to go speak to EasyCar about the additional driver charge, which indicates your guy had no authority to do what he did and say 'how about we waive the additional driver charge and use that to top up the insurance instead'. Complete scam, I have contacted the bank re unauthorsied charges on my CC. You shouldn't be allowed to operate like this.

I mentioned I only needed it for one day but had to book it for two as there was no mention online I could drop it off after hours on the day I needed it. The manager told me I could have booked it for one day. As compensation, as he added he couldn't change the booking in his system (???) so he offered to upgrade me to an automatic for free so long as I dropped it off by Saturday 1pm. I agreed, signed the form and returned the car full of petrol by 1pm Saturday. I then received notification from my bank that I'd been charged two days using an automatic, plus two days insurance. I called Europcar customer service to complain. They told me as I signed the contract there was nothing they could do. Plus they refused to put me through to the Victoria branch manager or put me through to their senior manager to raise the complaint. Incensed, I then went to the Victoria Europcar shop to explain to the manager the booking error. He wasn't there. I went again and again and again, three times he still wasn't there. These three times I explained to the Victoria staff in the manager's absence the mishap that had happened. Each time the staff I spoke to told me they'd get the manager to call me to sort out the mis-booking. The manager never called me. The fourth time I arrived at the Victoria branch, the manager was finally there, but kept me waiting 1/2hr before he turned up to talk to me. He looked surprised at my appearance and said he'd heard nothing about my complaint from any of his staff or customer services. The staff member behind me, who I'd met the day before and who'd promised to pass on my message, put his head in his hands. We knew perfectly well the manager was lying. He then told me I was lying and had made this whole thing up. He said he never offered me a free upgrade to an automatic from a manual car. He added, as I'd signed the contract my complaint meant nothing. But the contract I signed was misleading. The sum for £164 was black bold with lots of small type around it. This amount sounded about right for a 2 day manual hire including insurance I'd agreed to add on to the initial £115 fee. Not the £320 that was actually deducted from my bank account for a two day automatic hire. The manager walked off dismissing me. I called Europcar customer service again to complain. Three times the Europcar customer service put the phone down on me. I can't tell you how unjust, dishonest, disgraceful and unsettling this experience has been. I will never hire a Europcar EVER again."

Insurance and everything is covered by the broker. We just wanted to pick up our rental.\n\nWhat happened?\nAt the Europcar counter we were greeted by Euan (or Ewan). He seemed like one chirpy Scotsman. To our delight he upgraded us \"free of charge\". What an amazing guy! We couldn't believe our luck. He said, \"you definitely need something bigger where you are headed and I have just the car\".\n\nThere was no mention of additional costs whatsoever.\nWho wouldn't like a free upgrade when they're headed into the Scottish outback?\n\nSome papers were elegantly shuffled around, we were told to sign here, here and here. After that we had to pop our card into the machine for the deposit and it was a done deal. Only it wasn't.\n\nThe trickery and the damage.\nThe upgrade was not free of charge and the additional cost of the rental was £171.86 or EUR 205. EXTRA! That's more than the initial rental booking. Both numbers look extremely similar by the way. When we inserted our card for the deposit, we in fact paid for the upgrade. That was NEVER mentioned to us. We also never paid for a deposit, which is utterly bizarre. The kicker is that we didn't receive an end of rental statement either. Also, the charge for the upgrade was not taken out until 2 weeks after the rental (06/11/24). So even if we had paid with Monzo, which shows charges instantly we would not have realised it then and there at the counter.\n\nOf course we signed the papers and that's enough for Europcar. Why would they care? Their golden boy Euan is ripping off people by the planeloads making the rental car company a F-ton of extra money. Unfortunately our broker nor our bank couldn't help, but that's not the end of it. A quick Google search reveals that this isn't Euan's first con nor that Europcar will ever see the promised land.\n\nBEWARE: Euan is a smirking bastard who is out to get you. Be it extra insurance you don't need or \"free\" upgrades.\n\nPLEASE read what you sign.\n\nFURTHER ACTION will be taken via BVRLA.\n\nIf you read this and were scammed as well please take action.

      "text": "I would give this company 0 stars if I could. I stupidly did not read reviews before booking and naively thought such a well known company would be better. I really just wanted to book a car for a week, pay for it, with the price quoted and safely drive to my destination. I was quoted £467 for a car for 1 week which I think is way too much anyway. After booking I rang customer service as a change in plans meant I needed an infant car seat for my 4 month old baby. This was completed over the phone, quote changed slightly. I rang and emailed customer services the day before travel and was reassured everything was as it should be. Imagine my surprise when I arrived and was told I did not have a car seat booked, just a device (apparently a legal requirement seeing as Italian people have a tendency to leave their children in cars!) So I was charged for a car seat. Then pressure sold insurance. My £467 escalated to £968 (including a £100 hold on my credit card). The rep at the desk then handed me the most disgusting, filthy car seat, absolutely not fit for a 4 month old and told us to go and find the car, with 2 suitcases, bags and a baby in a pushchair. Checked my credit card statement, final charge was £721.33 + £21.27 non sterling transaction fee 🤣."

      "text": "On Friday the 20th December of 2024 I booked a rental vehicle through the Easyjet website, collecting it from Europcar Manchester Airport at 3:00pm.\n\nFrom the innumerous companies based in Manchester, I chose Europcar as it is a well-reputed company in the market, trustworthy and with relatively affordable prices.\nAccording to the booking summary I did not contract any other services or extra options in addition to the car rental.\n\nWhen collecting the vehicle the employee present at the time suggested me to upgrade my cover to a premium insurance, to which I said I was not interested.\n\nUpon my answer, your employee gave me several documents to sign under the excuse they were mandatory to the conclusion of the rental contract.\n\nThe car was returned with a full tank, without any faults or damage, something that was checked by your staff at the time of delivery.\n\nI was completely gobsmacked and furious when I received the invoice where you Europcar charged me almost double the amount that had been previously agreed.\n\nI will bring again to your attention that I did not contract or subscribed to any extra services, neither at the time of booking nor at the time of collection.\n\nAfter reading SEVERAL feedbacks from other dissatisfied customers on several internet pages, I can finally understand where the issue relies:\nBecause I refused the premium insurance, the employee took advantage of my apparent rush to collect the car keys and the fact that I was a foreigner and non English native, to give me the premium insurance contract to sign mixed up with other paperwork.\n\nThis is fraud, and you are accountable for it.\n\nUnfortunately this situation, which is very difficult to prove, seems to be recurring and many customers were scammed in this way (you can find plenty similar cases here in Google Feedback, for example).\n\nThat said, my only question is:\nAre your employees who, in search of commission money, deceive Europcar customers?\nOr is Europcar the one encouraging employees to carry out this type of fraudulent scheme?\nUntil what extend are you as a company involved in this fraudulent scheme?\n\nEither options are despicable and reprehensible.\nConsidering Europcar has been operating since 1949 and has a reputation to uphold, you should be ashamed of your employees actions and take responsibility for their misdeeds.\n\nI expect nothing than a full refund covering the extra money that was abusively withdrawn from my account, and for the employees who have been carrying such fraud to be sanctioned and brought to justice.\n\nI expect an answer from you within the next 15 days, and in the case of failure I will seek further action with legal authorities.\nI will also report this matter to the GOV.UK, Trading Standards Institute and to the ECRCS.\n\nYou can fool me once, but you won't fool twice. As someone who travels to England twice a year, I will never use your services again, and I will make sure this situation is widely spread."

They try and pressure people and scare them into spending more money on extras such as the premium protection cover which is nearly as much as the rental itself by imposing a disgraceful £1600 compulsory excess which leaves the customer no choice but to take the protection. I said i didn't want it but they then went and charged me for it anyway a week later thinking i wouldn't notice!!?? They also tried to get me to pay for fuel i might not need by trying to charge me for a full tank of fuel in advance. You say 'make sure its empty before you return it' so you expect the customer to just drive around aimlessly burning off fuel that they didn't need to pay Europcar for in the first place? They're basically a bunch of fraudulent con artists and their sneeky pressure tactics to get more money out of people is absolutely disgraceful."

      "text": "The practices of the London Gatwick office are completely and utterly fraudulent. I write this review so others can be armed with information and well prepared not be defrauded by this specific Europcar office of London Gatwick airport.\n\nI rented a car on the 30th August with no additional insurance protection to cover the excess because it was already covered on my credit card insurance. I communicated this to the representative who then included medium protection on the package and completely disregarded my verbal request. He asked me to sign the back of the page which I did as it was left completely blank without any additions.\n\nAfter the rental had ended I recognised I had been charged extra on my credit card although there was no follow up email from Europcar to inform of any of the charges (although my email was clearly included on the agreement). I called the office and to my shock they forwarded through the back page agreement which now had handwritten additions of the medium protection package.\n\nEuropcar, let’s be clear, this is complete and blatant fraud to change a document after it has been signed! Not only this, but I was also charged for 7 days of insurance even though the rental lasted for only 5 days! See photos on Google Review of Europcar London Gatwick for confirmation of this. This rental finally cost me almost triple the price that what was originally agreed in the initial reservation.\n\nTherefore, I advise anyone attending the Europcar Gatwick office to follow these recommendations:\n1. Record your conversation on your phone with any attendant at this office. If the attendant complains or refuses then point them to this review and ask to speak with their manager.\n2. Ensure that the attendant countersigns any documents in front of you before leaving the counter. If the signature looks similar to the one I have posted on the Google review then I advise requesting a manager or another attendant to complete the rental agreement.\n3. Cross out any inclusions that are not agreed to and take a photo of the main rental agreement and the back page that list additions so it can’t be changed afterwards.\n4. Finally, please post your review of this office so that others can be informed of this fraudulent behaviour, and the individual perpetrators are held accountable.\n\nEuropcar: If this review means that customer check-in at the Gatwick office takes far longer than any other office then you only have yourselves to blame. I have called customer service on multiple occasions with no action being taken. I have also sent multiple emails that all have been ignored now for over 3 months, which is well over the cited 7-10 days reply time that is promised. You will find the ignored case number as #21259873. I request that a refund be issued for these unauthorised charges and that this fraudulent behaviour of Europcar staff is prevented from occurring any further, especially by the individual that signed this document. If you want to show any endeavour to remain a reputable company then I expect a prompt reply to this review via my email which you have on file. My previous experiences with Europcar have all been positive but this is appalling. It is also worth checking that in all my other rentals I have never requested insurance and I never will. Please check your records to confirm this."

However the Swindon branch has topped this by generating an invoice in Dec for me hiring a van for 8 days excess mileage and a late return billing me over £500. This relates to a 3 day hire in October that was all settled and van returned on time and less excess mileage paid. After receiving emailed invoice I have contacted customer services whilst they ask branch to investigate. In the meantime the branch has taken £250 out of my bank account using my debit card that was used for the £250 security deposit in October. I managed to stop them taking another £54 from my credit card. I am beyond impressed with them. A hire before this one took 4 months and 4 phone calls and visits to sort out incorrectly billed excess mileage- make sure you take pics on collection and drop of if you really want to risk using this cowboy company!! Thanks for your pointless response below - I’d already spoken to your customer services who raised a dispute with the branch who then stole £250 from my account"

I realized this once the purchase had already gone through, I tried to cancel it but they weren't interested in helping me after I had handed over my money.\n\nMy complaint was ignored for two weeks before they sent me a canned response that the signature on the document was binding and this eliminated the possibility of a refund. I am now in the process of filing a complaint with an external regulatory body over their dishonest sales techniques.\n\nI ended up paying for unnecessary insurance that cost more than 150% of the car rental itself. No one would agree to this. Please be careful of this company's deceptive sales techniques, don't let them convince you that you need to give them more than you already have. Don't sign anything unless you're certain you understand what they are telling you. And be aware that you will likely not receive help from this company once they have received your money.\n\nUPDATE following the below response - Europcar has flatly denied my request for an investigation or a refund, requiring me to escalate the issue to a third party.\n\nI will never use this company again."

This was the first indication that things were not going smoothly.\n\nDespite having paid in advance for insurance, we were informed there was an additional hidden fee for coverage, which was an unexpected and unwelcome cost. We had budgeted for the trip assuming everything was prepaid, so this extra charge forced us to adjust our finances.\n\nWhile returning the car, an object was thrown from the vehicle in front of us on the motorway, striking the windscreen and causing a chip. At the rental depot, we informed the agent of the incident, providing details of the time and location, and offered to file a police report to address the situation. The agent dismissed our offer, advising that there was no need for a report, as nothing would be done about the chip. Trusting their advice, we proceeded to catch our flight home.\n\nMonths later, we were surprised to receive a charge for the windscreen damage, as there was no third party to claim from. Had we followed through with the police report, as we initially offered, this situation might have been avoided.\n\nIn summary, we strongly recommend caution when renting from Europcar UK. From hidden fees to aggressive upselling tactics, it seems they are more focused on extracting additional charges after the rental is complete. Our experience left us disappointed and frustrated."

I wasn’t able to get hold of a Jerry Can I tried multiple times. Not much I can do the do expect risk being caught driving with no insurance. I explained this to the man and he said that’s fine. I will explain. I then wake up on the Saturday to find they had took A full tank of fuel out of my account and they wasn’t even concerned that they had cancelled the insurance basically saying to me that I should have drove the vehicle uninsured when at the top of my road there is an ANPR camera that would’ve flagged no insurance and they would’ve been quick enough to send the police to my door disgusting behaviour considering it was a courtesy car whilst my mums mobility car was off-road. They would’ve been happy for it to fall back on my shoulders driving uninsured meaning I could have potentially been put on a driving ban or worse time in jail. I will be lodging a formal complaint. This is just that everyone knows that you like to cancel insurances. By the looks of it it is an shocking company with really bad reviews so I’m not overly surprised to be honest with their behaviour, if I could avoid using them I would, but unfortunately mobility only work with them so in need of a replacement vehicle I am stuck with them"

I had bee trying to call them all morning to bring it forward as I had to be in Gloucester by 5pm. They don’t answer this phones. They don’t even play music or have a message telling you that you are in aqueue….they just play you an advertisement over and over.\n\nMy insurance company did manage to contact them though, and Europcar called me shortly before 2pm. They told me that an MGHS has bee booked out to me and was on its way. This car never arrived. I then received another text saying that my car would be with me between 3 and 5. Shortly before 6pm the driver turned up with the smaller MGZS. I wasn’t able to fit all of my luggage plus cat crate into this so I had to leave some things behind.\n\nReturning the hire car is proving to be similarly difficult., largely because EuRopcar never answer their phones. I tried to call them several times during the week to talk to the about the return, but they don’t answer. As I am typing my insurer is also attempting to contact them. The have promised to call the, back, but that was over an hour ago. If I can’t return the cat today I am going to have to pay for another night at the B&B and another night for the cat at the veterinary hospital. I have also tried to call the Bristol branch to see if I can drop the car off there but they don’t answer either, and after 20 minutes of listening to their advent they cut you off with a message that just says “ sorry there is no one here to answer you call”.\n\nThey treat human beings with contempt. I am disabled and things like this have a very negative effect on my physical health. I hope that NFU Mutual and other car insurers will stop using them. Had I known that they would cause me this many problems I would have hired a car from somewhere else at my own expense."

When I went to pick car up from Glasgow Airport branch I was scammed from the minute I walked through the door. The young chap with a beard didn't even want to see my car hire voucher as he said he had it on his computer. Asked what car I drove normally I said an automatic as I have rhymathoid arthritis but for a week I would only need a manual which I had booked. Told me he would give me an automatic at no extra cost as I had a disability also said my daughter could be an additional driver in case I wasn't able to drive while I was visiting family. I did sign a form after he said it was a holding deposit which would all be returned after I dropped car off( they took £903 out my account). He folded up paper and put into envelope I made a point in say you haven't charged me any extra have you as my reading eyesight isn't good. Reply not at all madam. Enjoy your stay, dropped car off flowing Monday 14th Oct . Next day I found out they had taken out £653 out of my account for upgrade, young driver addition my daughter is 25. I have complained and told that because I signed it's my fault. They have scammed me out of this money by playing on my disability and poor reading eyesight. So I have just paid £900 for a hire car for a week which is absolutely terrifying. I could have got taxis everywhere cheaper than this. It is shocking what people are prepared to do to vulnerable people who are honest and hardworking. Glasgow branch seems to be good at doing this. I will never use or recommend them ever again. If I don't get my money back I will contact watchdog and the ombudsman. Playing on someone's disability is shocking. If I could I would give them zero stars"

On arrival at the Europcar office at Gatwick I was informed that I would have to pay a £552.16 refundable deposit before I could take the car. My partner handed over his credit card which the lady said it would be blocked on, we told her immediately it had been taken off the credit card but she said it never mind it will be refunded on return of the vehicle. 8 weeks later and still no refund. Going through our paperwork recently we only now have noticed that she didn't take a deposit but rather sold us the most expensive insurance without telling us. It's charged as Premium Protection. Possibly our fault for not noticing it at the time but after travelling for for 19 hours from Cape Town via Dubai to the UK, you are eager to get on the road, so that's the reason we didn't notice that we had been blatantly lied to.\nWe would still like this matter to be resolved and the lady in question to be charged instead as this is fraud."

Avoid at all costs!\n\nBooked with them thinking they were a reputable company as my wife was travelling alone with our 4 kids, so I wanted a no-hassle experience for them....well how wrong was I! Their agents at the airport counter were extremely rude, pushy and disingenuous with my wife, and she ended up paying £500 for comprehensive insurance which she didnt want, the car they gave us had a worse NCAP safety rating than the car advertised, which i understand to an extent they cant guarantee what car you get, but we made a simple request, she was staying nearby and the rental was for 26 days during low season, so presumably the advertised car would come back into availability during that period, could they give us a call so we could pop in and swap the cars, well it was as if I was asking them to sacrifice their only child, no one would give a straight answer, lots of ummming and arrring, lying to us about not knowing when cars would come back. Left the kiosk asking them to call us when they know more, not only did they not call us it took 3 days for their customer services team to even acknowledge our email, saying they couldnt look into our complaint until the rental period was over!! What a load of garbage... Seriously, save your money, or go to Hertz, Sixt or Avis...."

      "text": "Please beware! Paid £1,400 for a £580 Europcar Rental: Misleading Deposits and Hidden Insurance Costs\n\nI initially booked a 2-week rental for what seemed like a great price—£237 in total. The pick-up process went smoothly, and I was asked to pay a “deposit,” which I was told would be refunded if the car was returned intact. However, at no point did the staff mention any additional costs beyond what I had already paid online.\n\nFast forward to the end of the two weeks—I needed to extend my rental, but it wasn’t possible. No big deal; I returned the car and booked another one for £343. This time, I noticed that they had sneakily added a £30 per day insurance premium. To my shock, this same hidden charge had been applied to my first rental as well, even though it was never communicated to me.\n\nNow, here’s the real kicker: the so-called “deposit” isn’t a deposit at all! They cleverly call it that to make you think you’ll get the full amount back, but in reality, they deduct the insurance charges from it. It’s a deliberate tactic to keep the insurance cost as hidden as possible until it’s too late.\n\nWhen I asked if I could opt out of the insurance, they refused to give me a car and would not refund the £300+ I had already paid. In the end, what was meant to be a straightforward car rental turned into a financial nightmare. For four weeks of car rental, I spent £580 on the online booking, plus an outrageous £800+ on insurance, bringing the total to nearly £1,400.\n\nIt’s clear that Europcar’s strategy is to lure customers with attractive online rates, and then, after you’ve paid the non-refundable fee, hit you with surprise insurance charges—last minute—leaving you with no choice but to accept. If insurance is mandatory, why isn’t it included in the advertised price so that customers can make an informed decision? This is blatant false advertising.\n\nEuropcar has lost me as a customer forever, and I strongly advise anyone to steer clear of this company. In all fairness, the cars themselves are clean and good, but their deceptive, scheming practices make for a truly awful experience."

The young lad was helpful but immediately went off and returned with two Mercedes keys and told me I could have them instead at a discount. I told him that I wanted the car I had ordered but with the basic insurance. In the end that car wasn’t available so I had a free upgrade. So far so good.\nI repeated about my basic insurance requirements. He then went through the costs. I told him I didn’t want roadside assistance but he told me that was part of the package. I should have questioned him further on the package but he was nice and helpful so I signed the contract. Later when I read it closely I realised I had paid for premium insurance. I have now complained but have been told I have to wait until the hire has finished before I can complain. I now have the feeling the whole thing is a well rehearsed con to get the client to pay for higher insurance. Reassure the customer you have his best interests, focus on the free upgrade, gloss over questions on insurance and then stick him with premium cover. No doubt I will get no rebate later when I complain again.\nBottom line is to be very suspicious. If you suspect they are trying to cheat you they probably are."

At the airport counter, the agent informed me that since I already had insurance with full coverage, I did not need to subscribe to any additional insurance. I was also told that a deposit of 700 euros would be charged (something I was already aware of through the contract signed with e-Dreams). In good faith, I signed the required forms on the tablet (the amount indicated was £647, which I believed to be the deposit) and was given a document with the rental and payment details; nothing else was handed to me, nor sent via email (certainly not an insurance policy that might have raised some suspicions).\nAfter two months of waiting for the refund of what I thought was the deposit, I was informed, upon my inquiry, that no refund would be issued as the amount charged corresponded to the cost of the insurance I had supposedly subscribed to. Realizing I had signed a document without verifying that the amount (which was not specified) actually consisted of £100 for the deposit and £546 for the insurance policy (this was the final amount charged), I nonetheless filed a complaint with customer service. Their prompt response (only 21 minutes after my email!) stated that since it was impossible to verify what had been discussed verbally, only the signed document held any validity! It goes without saying that all the information regarding the costs and charges was written in such a small font that one would need not just a pair of glasses but a magnifying glass!"

      "text": "A few days after returning my rental car without any damages & full of petrol (agreement number: 156837779), I realised that they didn't refund the entire deposit of £752.38 that I left on the counter at the Edinburgh Airport.\nSo I reached out to the customer service asking why they didn't do it and there were still £68.22 pending to be refunded. After waiting 1 week they replied saying that there was a mistake and they charged me \"1 additional day of hire plus licenses and fees due to an error\", so they refunded £15.82 for the overcharge. At that moment I was still confused why they haven't refunded the rest of the money, so I had to follow-up 2 times with them because they were not saying anything about the rest £52.38 pending to be refunded.\nThen finally they confirm that those 52 pounds are related to an upgraded added at the counter and that at the time of the pickup, there was added a \"Roadside Assistance Express.\"\n\nAt this moment I also realize that the agent basically did this intentionally because I didn't buy the full coverage insurance at the counter. I told the agent that I had my own private insurance and he stated that the private insurances from booking.com don't cover glass and wheels. I told him that it was an insurance with my bank and that it has full coverage, so it seems like in that moment he decided to add the Roadside Assistance Express and didn't me anything that this was an upgrade and that I had to pay £52.38 extra for it.\nIf he would have done that, obviously I would have say no because I have full private coverage insurance already for this.\n\nWhat did the agent do? He just told me to sign the Rental agreement in multiple corners of the paper on both sides and that's it. And then told me to put my credit card for the deposit. He also didn't mention the value of the total deposit and didn't say that he was charging me £700 for the non-insurance deposit and £52.38 for the Roadside Assistance Express. At that moment I would have also asked by there were 2 payments and I would have cancel it.\n\nThis is a very old school mislead sales tactic that should be claimed, but the customer service hasn't helped me further because I signed the agreement. The agent also signed the paper, but he didn't put his name, so I'm still waiting for a response from customer service to know the name of the agent who did this and file an official claim. What a terrible and disappointing experience."

      "text": "I hired a car from Europcar (Volvo XC60) on a recent trip to Nice. I booked the rental through a 3rd party comparison site and paid a deposit for the rental and was covered for some extras, such as environmental surcharge. On arrival at the rental centre we were in a queue for about an hour and when we got to the desk was greeted by a very pushy rep. The cost of the rental was not as per the original agreement and they had added on the additional environmental charge. The salesperson also tried to \"upsell\" me a Mercedes and additional insurance, which I declined, at which point his demeanor became more aggressive. I was also miss-sold a full tank of fuel on the understanding that I would only be charged for fuel I used. They also charged me over £400 for a tiny scratch on the bottom of the rear bumper which I must have missed on the initial inspection, however I do have insurance cover for this. Their business model is clearly to misrepresent the original displayed price and then aggressively sell or even miss-sell add-ons and I strongly suspect their staff are targeted and compensated based on these sales. I will never be renting from Europcar again and would urge others to think twice before using their services."

I phoned customer services who weren’t really much help. They told me I’d have to contact Edinburgh branch at Salamander Street to ask when I’d get the car. However they didn’t answer the phone and I was redirected to customer service again who weren’t able to tell me when or if I would get a car. So now I’m without transport and am having to spend valuable time and money chasing them up to no avail. I definitely would not pay this company for the hire of a car as they are clearly unreliable, promising cars they can’t or font deliver. Steer clear!!!"

They don't guarantee it wont change so isn't really anything we can do.\n\nThose phone calls were also charging my phone bill without me knowing, but again, apparently that's in the small print somewhere so they wont do anything about that either- although I have sent an email. It incurred £18.47.\n\nLastly, the fine for the scratched alloy. Essentially, when I returned the car, I parked it in the drop off bay, then headed in assuming we would do the check out report with the europcar person as it was within drop off hours, but the queue was HUGE, literally out the door into the street. I had work, so didn't get a chance to check out the car. They then sent me the email saying they found a small scratch to the alloy, that isn't covered, even though I got the highest insurance cover I was eligible for. I emailed to say that I didn't damage the car and if they had enough staff then we would have done the check out together, but they basically said that's not their problem and I will still be charged for the damage- despite escalating it.\n\n- I see their cutnpaste 'pretend to care' reply below.

She assured us that she would be putting the account on hold whilst they investigated further and she would ensure we received responses to our emails (which we never did). It is now 4 months since then, and we have had no update on the outcome of their investigations or notice that the claim had been re-opened.

At the same time the system still sends you instructions to confirm your identity although you aren't getting a car.\n\nThe phone number for the branch, takes you to the main customer service, and again they do not know the availability of vehicles at the branch.\n\nThe company is extremely difficult to book with and contact, therefore I would avoid at all costs if you don't want to waste your time."

I’ve spent over a week trying to get the refund, I’ve been told I would receive emails (which I haven’t). I was also pressurised to upgrade the insurance upon arrival so the whole experience has been really expensive. I would STRONGLY recommend to NOT use Europcar. I will be using Hertz next time. For top prices one would expect top customer service and after a 15 minuets phone call just now I feel no further forward with it. Not a happy customer!"

This is not mentioned anywhere on the rental agreement nor in the list of optional products I signed for. When I questioned EUROPCAR support regarding not receiving the product I was told I was getting and paying a premium for the incorrect car and a large charge not mentioned anywhere I was told that as they had a signed agreement they were not ready to reimburse any monies. Mohammed at EUROPCAR lied about the product we were getting talked up the rental and was not transparent about the charges. He then had the nerve to request we give him a good review presumably so he could get a good bonus. This is obviously Europcars business model and patently dishonest.\nPhilip Middleton"

However, upon return, I also found out that Europcar didn't honour my Qeeq reservation at all but charged me for the rental of the vehicle as if I purchased it on the spot, as well as premium station surcharge, and licenses and fees, which amounted to extra 210.82 GBP. The person who served me at the Europcar at Stansted did not inform me about my reservation not being honoured at all. I found out later, when I called their customer service and they sent me the invoice. They also informed me they don't honour third party reservations as they don't include all fees. Scam."

He then asked if we wanted Roadside Assistance cover and said it was \"only £5\". Both my husband and I commented and questioned the amount, but he confirmed that yes it was just £5 so we agreed. Stupidly I signed the agreement without checking it, assuming it was just for the car hire (which I had pre-paid) and the extra £5. It wasn't until I got the final invoice after returning the car that I saw that the roadside assistance was not £5, but was in fact £5.81 PER DAY plus VAT, making a total of £48.97. This was an added cost of 32%. I raised the matter with Europcar, but they were not interested in what the sales assistant told us, only what I had signed for. I consider this to be sharp practice, taking advantage of people who have had an early start, travelled a long distance and are anxious to get their car and go. This car hire was only for a week. Later in the year we will be hiring a car for a month, but it won't be with Europcar or any of their other companies, so for £48.97 they've lost out on a future hire of around £1300 and more on future hires."

I was travelling to Italy as I am part of Andrea Bocelli's management team and he was performing a series of concerts featuring other big names in Tuscany - I needed a reliable car to navigate this very rural area. On arrival the initial car they tried to give me (which wasn't what I'd booked) had a busted wing mirror so I had to trek back from the car park to the terminal with two large suitcases to get a different car. Within 3 hours the car had a puncture to the front passenger tire. I'm stranded in the middle of a very rural area of Tuscany in the pitch black and there is no spare tire in the car, just a lovely empty space in the boot where it should be. Some kindly locals allowed me to leave the car on their land until the morning but it was an extremely dangerous situation to be in as a woman alone. The following morning I made various attempts to contact Europcar by phone and email, to little avail. Despite having taken out their premium coverage package no one seemed to care. I am still (7 days later) waiting for the callback they said would be 20 mins. My Italian colleague also made various attempts - apparently not even speaking the language gets you anywhere. At one point I was told a tow truck would come and take it (offering no replacement) but I needed to call him back with the full details of exactly where the car was located. On trying to call back I got a message saying the number was out of service. In the end I had to arrange for a local mechanic to tow it back to their garage and replace the tire. They said the tire d was already quite bald and Europcar should not have sent that car out as it was. It cost 300 euro to get it fixed which Europcar have seemingly no interest in reimbursing. When returning the car I told them the busted tire was in the boot, a member of staff inspected the car then told me my holding deposit would be taken because the puncture constituted damage to the car, despite the fact that tires are obviously subject to wear and tear, the mechanic had stated in his report it was unfit for purpose AND I HAD REPLACED IT AT MY OWN EXPENSE. Disgusting service.\n\nUpdated following Europcar’s below reply: I have already emailed customer service to no avail days ago. I have also been in the phone with customer service at 11.12am today who said this would all be logged and I would receive an email with next steps directly after the all. It’s over two hours later - no email. Seriously…"

We were offered a smaller class car at the original cost or a larger premium car at extra cost which is a lesser service than I have received at other car rental companies, but not the cause of this low review. To justify our car not being available, the staff member presented a rule about booking only being held for 1 hour, which we cannot locate in the T&Cs from our booking agent or Europcar’s own. Note for anyone with a booking already, in reading some FAQ pages there is the recommendation to add flight number (which we had not as we had not trawled through all the FAQs). So recommend anyone reading this to make sure flight details are submitted. But surely this should be front and centre in booking process and also the T&Cs?\n\nHowever our experience continued to worsen as on leaving the yard we saw the type of car we booked being given to people after us in the queue by the same member of staff who had just served us. They had also had flight delays and had been told their booked car (again a larger one) was not available despite their being several others in the yard. They were also offered an upgrade to a premium car. Numerous other people in the queue (we were waiting 45mins) also seemed to have issues.\n\nSo it appears as though Europcar Stansted are giving people the run around claiming car are rebooked but are just chasing upgrade fees.\n\nThe smaller vehicle does not fit our family and luggage so we have to make further arrangements. It is a sour experience on arrival in the UK for a holiday.\n\nWe have contacted Europcar through their website and will update this post when a response is provided.\n\n- - - - - - - -\n\nAdditional comment following the Europcar response below.

Rented as I have done for many years through broker company and showed up to the Europa car (Victoria) and zero insurance included - had to pay premium or pay for full market value for the car if any damage (!!) and tons of extra charges. I was running late due to delays my side- tried to ring to shift the time slot but no pick up - … and then charged more for ‘an upgrade’ as they cancelled my original booking. So what was originally a £178 rental turned out to be well over £400!! The car was scratched and dented and they tried to claim two of the scratches were on my watch, despite them being listed on my copy (yet not theirs)….! Thankfully the manager remembered seeing these … avoid avoid avoid… guy who charged me tried to make it seem he was doing me a ‘favour’. Booked through Holiday Autos which I’ve used many times but both they and Europacar total Fail! All I can say is check and double check you’re covered.

      "text": "I rented a car from Europcar at Gatwick south terminal for a week from 5th June and when I dropped it back I was told by the man checking it in all was in order. No damage was seen as none existed and it was refuelled. I proceeded to the airport with my elderly mum. Today a week later I received a letter by email from Europcar from their insurance department telling me that there was left side left mirror cap/housing scratch >5-15 cm and that I am liable for an excess. I have a speech impediment so I had my husband ring them to discuss because of my poor speech I didn’t pass their data checks and needless to say they can’t discuss with him. GDPR\nThey told me to send an email because my speech is poor. I feel I have been targeted here as a soft touch. There was no damage and this is all a lie. I can do without this stress.\nI advise you don’t ever consider a rental from this company. It was my first and last rental. This is a scam I am faced with. I sent an email and I await a reply.\nThis rental company isn’t worth the hassle and will cost me a lot if they succeed in telling me I damaged a car which I didn’t.\n\nPs following the reply below I have emailed many times and all I am told by three different replies there is there was damage on the car on return and I have been sent a ‘statement of return’ dated correctly but with a forgery signature on it. It states I ageee to damage on a side mirror. Doesn’t this really make you so annoyed. Where is the justice here. I have asked repeatedly for the name of the staff member but that person remains anonymous. They are hiding behind a company with a large customer services department but they are BAD. A photo attached but because this was not pointed out at the time of return I have no way to confirm this was or was not present. This is evil. I am 56 and I have been renting cars for 36 years and never have I had an experience as this. It’s pure fraud and this needs to be called out for what it is and Europcar need to look into this and their employees involved here. There are two who accepted back the car and one of those is the man at the rental desk the day I hired the car.\nWho needs this hassel. Now a bill by email today for €274. Believe me they have picked the wrong person to annoy and I will not be parting with any of my money to settle this fraudulent bill. I am an honest person and if there was damage on the car and it was pointed out to me on return then I would be the first to pay up. In fact I have an insurance for the excess but this is wrong on all accounts and I will not be settling. How dare they treat their customers like this. Shame on them and shame on all Europcar for allowing this to happen despite my emails.\nIf I lived near Gatwick airport I would go to the europcar office there and find the members of staff involved. I would insist on looking at the damage on the car to measure if this scratch exists and if it is over 5cm even though this is now 5 weeks today after the car was returned.\nEuropcar you are awful"

Take into mind that the car was only £106 for the week but now because we didn't have a credit card they wanted an extra 180 euros for insurance and 290 euros for the debit card details and deposit. The staff were very rude and our kids were getting very uncomfortable. The car was very scratched when we got it and so my husband took photos just in case. The site said that the car could fit in our suitcases which it could not but lucky enough having 3 small children we managed to squeeze the other suitcases on the foot well. We drove the car to the hotel. In the whole week we drove the car once for around 30 minutes. It was parked in the hotels car park. When we got back to the car depot one of the workers went straight out to the car and straight to the windscreen, apparently we had scratched the windscreen. I explained that we used it for a total of an hour in the whole week of having the vehicle and that there were scratches all over the car when we received it. The man sarcastically said maybe you upset someone at the hotel. Then he said maybe a cat scratched it. These accusations were absolutely ridiculous and he started getting very rude which was making my kids very distraught. I will not be using Europcar again, the whole experience has me thinking how many other customers they've fleeced and upset!"

      "text": "Under no circumstances accept the offer of an upgrade. As nice as the front desk people seem, \"It will only cost...\" is not the truth. I made it clear I did not want to pay an uplift charge just for changing one thing on my booking. I wasn't planning on changing my booking but Mike at the Europcar on Northern Perimeter Road offered me an upgrade car which I turned down. My wife said she would like to be added as an additional driver and I was given the offer of full cover insurance or an automatic for the same cost as adding my wife at GBP 20 a day. I chose the automatic and added my wife as an additional driver. I was surprised to find that rather than GBP 24 a day, the an addition GBP 60 was added. Do not sign anything until you have checked the paperwork they give you. There is no mention of an uplift charge, 19%, just the item and the total. Zero mention is made at the desk that there will be an exorbitant charge just because you make a change at the desk. I wrote to customer service and all that was done was to point out there is an up lift charge that is in the documentation. I challenge anyone to find it, especially when getting off a flight and tired. It should be made clear by the desk staff that there will be an additional charge above and beyond the cost of item added, for the privilege of accepting the offer of the desk staff.\n\nThis is underhand. It should be made clear verbally and the uplift charge pointed out in the documentation. Most people like myself would not accept it.\n\nTo add my wife as an additional driver is valid, to disguise it by offering an automatic or additional insurance cover with no extra cost as I was adding my wife and then charging an uplift charge for changing to an automatic is deceptive.\n\nI wrote to customer service and I received a brief response that essentially said read the paperwork and the 19% uplift charge would not be removed.\n\nI have been a Europcar customer for nearly 30 years. This is the last time I will book with Europcar.\n\nAnother word of warning. There is no paperwork to sign and note any damages or marks when picking up the car. I took photographs before driving off and asked for the paperwork at the gate before leaving. The response I got was unclear so I drove back into the Europcar premises and asked at reception. They said upload the photographs. I could not find anywhere to upload the photographs. Beware, after logging on to the website there is a paragraph that says the noted damages are printed on the documentation you receive. It is not obvious. Take time to take photographs and compare to the documentation you are given. In my case not all damages, scratches were noted and the description leaves the extent open to dispute. Ask the reception to come out to the car, note all the damages and scratches and ask for the paperwork to be updated and sign the new documentation.\n\nDo not take anything at face value. Europcar will hide behind not telling you of the uplift costs and leave it open for dispute on any previous damages before picking up the car.\n\nVery disappointed by the business practices. Be very careful and ask for a full breakdown of any cost above and beyond what you think you have agreed to, it is not clear."

I never imagined being scammed like this in the UK.\n\nThe story is that I reserved a car for £366 with basic insurance. However, when I arrived at their office at Stansted Airport, they suggested I upgrade to premium insurance for just an additional £4 per day, which would total £28 for 7 days. I agreed and signed the contract. After paying the original amount plus 28 pounds, they also mentioned they needed to reserve £400 for own risk, which I accepted.\n\nUpon returning to the Netherlands, I received a bill for £642. When I checked, it turned out that the insurance was actually £28 per day, not £4. Although the bill I signed indeed stated £28 per day, I initially trusted their verbal claim and, being tired after my travel, did not double-check before signing.\n\nThis experience has been extremely frustrating. Please be cautious and carefully check everything if you choose to use Europcar. They were deceitful in my case, so ensure you verify all details before signing anything."

Extra £529 scammed on debit card, was supposed to be the deposit.\nEuropcar refuse to refund as I signed contract which I was told was to pay the deposit for the car.\nHow many other customers have extortion complaints about Europcar? This clearly needs to be investigated for the protection of the car hire public.\nThe car hire, that I paid for through Argus car hire for two weeks was at £ 295, plus premium damage access cover at £51 total £ 346.71p to ET Car Hire on the 1st February 2024.\nThe car was a group A car Fiat 500 or similar.\nWhen I arrived at Stansted I had to wait almost an hour, and I showed my Argus car hire digital booking. I was told that I can have a free upgrade, i said i was happy with the car i had booked but was promised it would not be at any extra cost i.e totally free upgrade! So Ok, other customers were also being offered upgrades as well!!!\nInsurance premium was offered for cover very hard selling, I said I had already covered this with AXA.\nI was told to pay for the deposit for the car (which I knew I had to pay) & that this would be refunded on the cars return. I was covered for all damages by my excess cover by AXA insurance paid through Argus car rentals.\nExtortion, deceit & fraud can be expected when booking a car through these criminals, though they get you to sign the contract stating \"signature is just for the holding deposit on car. Company are proud of their desk clerks who are \"instructed to Sell there products\" any way any means to get revenues ."

      "text": "We used Europcar to hire a vehicle for the weekend in Italy from their Milan Bergamo Airport Branch. Booking the rental was easy enough, paid in advance for what I thought was a very fair price… When we arrived to collect the car, we were waiting a little while as the branch was clearly a bit understaffed and there were only two gentleman dealing with a high volume of customers, but when we got to the front of the queue we were told we’d had a complimentary upgrade from a Fiat 500 to a Peugeot 2008, which of course we were very pleased about! After reading that I would have to leave a deposit, I was asked to make a payment in Euro and thought no more of it, took the keys, was asked to sign a invoice in Italian and then given a copy. We used the car for four days, had absolutely no issues with it, returned the vehicle and had the invoice through to say the vehicle was returned in the same condition it was collected in and there would be no further charges. To my surprise, the day after we returned the vehicle, my credit card was charged with an additional fee of £178. I rang Europcar customer services, they told me I had ‘purchased’ a Premium Protection Package (which cost significantly more than the total amount I had paid for the booking) and when I told them I had not purchased any additional products and I’d like fee refunded they told me they would have to pass it on to their investigations team and someone would contact me within 48 hours! 5 days later, having chased them up again yesterday, I was fobbed off and told to send an email. I am now £178 down and there seems to be no urgency to help get this resolved. At best this is mis selling an insurance product, at worst it’s theft! Shocking service after what was initially a very good experience!"

When we did this (a massive hassle) then dropped the car off, the Europcar staff member who we spoke to laughed and said this was absolute nonsense.\n\nThe car is advertised as \"Ford Focus or similar\", but there was clearly zero chance we would have ever got an actual Focus or anything other than a ropey old Kia (we checked the carpark on collection and drop off, nothing but old Kias in the Europcar section, although SIXT had a lot of new looking Fords and Audis....). it would be ok if it was mostly Ford Focuses with a few Kias to cover when very busy, but clearly not the case so this is just false advertising.\n\nAlso, why is the extra insurance not offered online when people would have had time to review it in detail and see if it was worth the money? Instead of being pressured into it when in a rush to get the car and leave. everything else is offered online, why not this? Not only is it a dubious sales practise, it also extends the pickup time to painful levels.\n\nI used to use Europcar a lot for work about 10 years ago, back then it was a trustworthy, quick and reliable service, clearly it has gone way downhill and I won't be using it again."

      "text": "I recently picked up a car from Europcar Oxford. I had pre-reserved the car with a guaranteed price including VAT. Reservation no. 1171278816. The staff informed me very forcefully that no travel insurance covered the Europcar excess, so I should pay extra for Europcar's own excess insurance. This did not seem correct to me. So I immediately rang my travel insurance company and was assured the large excess that Europcar had was in fact fully covered by my travel insurance policy. So I very clearly declined the Europcar's insurance for the excess. The car I had reserved was not available, so I was told I was upgraded to a larger car at no charge. So I signed the form and took the car. However, when I later looked at the paperwork, I had been charged GBP 405 more than the guaranteed price. I have tried repeatedly to contact Europcar Oxford, but they will not answer their phone. I contacted Europcar customer services UK by email, they gave me a case no. 19781003, but said they could not help as the car was not yet returned. I then rang Europcar UK and spoke to Chris, who tried to help, but said he could not access what charges had been made. He thought perhaps I had been mistakenly charged for the Europcar excess insurance that I had clearly declined. He tried to ring the Oxford office, as he said only they would be able to sort out the overcharge, but they would not answer their phone. He emailed the Oxford office and asked them to contact me, but they have not. So I have been charged an additional GBP 405 and cannot find out why or have it adjusted. I find it appalling that a large company like Europcar cannot be contactable to sort out problems. It is perhaps a warning to others that guaranteed price is not honoured at Europcar UK and the company seems determined to avoid any contact with customers who have any problems. I have found it so frustrating trying to contact someone at Europcar who can help. I cannot recommend renting a car from Europcar Oxford."

It was wonderfully cheap (5 days for 90GBP).\n\nAfter the (successful) rental period, some days later I realized that i was charged an extra 173GBP, which was a surprise.\n\nAfter some emails (booking.com responded fast, europcar usually with 4-5 days delay) i got the info, that i bought a premium insurance at the desk (at pick up), so they cannot help. The car had 2x insurances, according to their helpdesk: “with my verbal agreement and unable to comment further as I was not part of the verbal discussion”...\n\nWhat?!\n\nAt pick up, the agent (who was kind by the way) confirmed, that it is paid and it has full insurance, and i said \"yes, i know\", because i have chosen the option \"full insurance\" at booking.com. This was the full conversation about the insurance.\nHe didn't offer any other one.\nThere was no \"verbal agreement\". It was a trap.\nThe paper, which i signed there, my copy contained one line on the 1st page (with very small font) about a premium insurance, but it seemed to be the paid one (for me). In fact, this was a new insurance, which was twice as expensive than the whole rental!\n\nSo my advice: read very carefully the paper at pick up, because they have put an extra, unwanted item in my case.\n\nThe guy in the parking lot was kind, but the communication after the rental process was not cooperative. They repeated the same answer (copy+paste), not responding my questions, slowly, and didn’t help the find the agent (or give direct contact) who could confirm the situation. I tried to call them (desk at Glasgow airport, with no success, waiting during the \"please wait music\" for a long time). The europcar UK was a wall, which I bounced back.\n\nThis case could ruin all the whole holiday. I have to focus strongly on the positive side of the trip, otherwise this ruins it fully. :("

I have never had that happen to me before. When I am asked at a car rental if I want additional insurance I always decline. I have never had the experience of it being put on my bill without being asked. Is that the Europcar policy? I have asked them to clarify that but they have not done so. It is very suspicious practice - although a quick google search shows it has happened to many others\n\nI was told that since it was my first time using Europcar I was being given a free upgrade so i assumed that represented the difference in my paperwork\nI was then given a form and told to sign where the x's were.\nI do feel that I have been tricked into paying a higher fee. It's not just a few euros, my bill has trippled. I contacted customer complaints who more or less said it was my word against theirs and since I signed the paperwork the case is closed.\nWould never use again and would not recommend anyone else does"

The car got collect the following day but was not signed by me when collected.

The company lacks any accountability and has no structure at all. You all need training on time management"

I asked them to put me through to the chester branch where I spoke to a man called Simon who confirmed they collected the car full but it was then used as a pool car and the charge should not have been attempted. I tried the link they suggest to contact for complaints europcar.co.uk/ contact-us/email which after trying 5 times I gave up as it DOES NOT WORK..\nI suggest everyone looks elsewhere when renting/hiring a vehicle as this lot have genuinely earned their pitiful rating here."

The driver delivered the courtesy car to my house but didn't ask for my signature, instead, he just inserted the keys into my front door mailbox and left. Ridiculously Europcar requested that I personally deliver the signed documents to their office (your employee did not ask me to sign the document in person, and now you are requesting me to personally deliver the document back to your office? Is this the proper way to treat a customer?).\n\nAfterward my car is repaired, the garage delivered it back to my home without notice, and the staff of garage said he will drive the courtesy car back to their garage. Europcar will directly retrieve the courtesy car from their garage (I just immigrated to the UK, and I don't know if this is a normal practice, but the driver emphasize that it is normal in the UK, said no worries).\n\nTwo days later, I received an invoice from Europcar by email which is charging me for petrol fees. I can understand this, but when I returned home that day, I only discovered that the driver said he need to take the courtesy car away. At that time, I didn't think about returning the car with a full tank of petrol, and then I received a very unreasonable fuel charge.\n\nI sent two emails to Europcar to express my dissatisfaction and explain the situation when I returned the courtesy car (I understand that I need to return the courtesy car with a full tank of petrol, but the problem is I had no idea the garage driver would suddenly ask to take it away). I requested that the fuel cost be charged based on the actual market price, but I did not receive any response. After that, I returned to my hometown for three weeks. I did not receive any email, phone call, or SMS reminder from Europcar during that period.\n\nWhen I returned to the UK, I received a letter from Shakespeare Martineau which is pursuing the debt on behalf of Europcar, with a late payment charge of £40. From day one I have never received an original invoice from Europcar, only electronic ones, which do not mention any penalties for late payment.\n\nI finally settled the invoice payment to Shakespeare Martineau before the deadline. At the same time, I emailed the payment receipt to Europcar and Shakespeare Martineau, emphasizing repeatedly that the £40 late payment charge is unreasonable. I won't bear this unreasonable charge.\n\nTwo weeks have passed and I just received an email from Shakespeare Martineau, saying that I haven't paid the outstanding debt. Today, I called Europcar to inquire about it, but the staff said they don’t know what’s happening and asked me to call another number for further information. And then I waited for 20 minutes, and in the end, they asked me to leave a message saying they would call me back.\n\nI have been living in the UK for 2 years, and sincerely, many of my friends have had to contact insurance companies for claims due to traffic accidents. Many of them say that Marshmallow Insurance Company's handling of insurance claims is poor. I really didn't expect it to be this bad. I am the victim, my car got hit. The other party says it's a company car and asks me to claim compensation from their insurance company. I didn't expect that later on, Marshmallow, the law firm and Europcar would all constantly seek opportunities to charge fees from me or the other party. This is simply an all-in-one scam that insurance companies have taken advantage of government regulatory loopholes and expanded. Under the guise of claims insurance, actually providing various services under different pretexts and then charging exorbitant and unreasonable fees.\n\nI will give Europcar a negative review and raise awareness to their opaque operations. In any situation, whenever individuals file a claim with their insurance company, it is always the citizens who end up being the victims while these businesses benefit."

The 'nice' lady gave me a free upgrade and didn't try to up sell me, was very pleased with the car and experience initially. Imagine my surprise when I received an invoice from them after I returned the car to discover I had been charged for 3 days premium insurance! Wasn't even mentioned when I collected the car, she just added it to my credit card. Of course this is all my fault for not thoroughly checking what I was signing for, she lulled me into thinking they were an honest company. Taught me a £92 (over twice the car price) lesson! I'm sure this is fraud. I complained but of course as I signed they said I must have agreed to the verbal agreement. Am recommending to everyone to avoid!"

      "text": "Unfortunately I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to express my disappointment with my recent car rental experience at Faro Airport.Upon booking the car rental for six days, I was quoted a price of £84 pounds, which seemed reasonable and within my budget. However, upon arriving at your office at the airport, I was informed of additional charges that were not initially disclosed. These included insurance fees and road tax for motorways, amounting to an extra £128 on top of the initial price.This unexpected increase in charges came as a surprise and was quite disappointing. As a customer, I value transparency and clear communication when it comes to pricing and fees. It's disheartening to encounter hidden costs that significantly impact the overall expense of the rental.I want to emphasize the importance of transparent pricing and upfront disclosure of all fees associated with the rental. Customers should be fully informed of the total cost before making a decision to proceed with the booking. Such transparency not only fosters trust but also allows customers to make informed choices.Unfortunately, this experience has left me feeling dissatisfied, and I must say that I will not be considering your services for any future car rentals. I hope that you will take this feedback constructively and consider implementing measures to ensure transparent pricing practices in the future.Thank you for your attention to this matter"

The young man went and spoke to his manager and then came back and said yes he had a car available.\nThis is where the misleading begins.\nI asked for 3 days - Wednesday to Saturday morning - He put 5 days on the order\nHe mentioned a full tank of petrol from Europcar - I refused.\nHe mentioned NOTHING else. My other hire was 56 GBP for 3 days - He quoted me 515GBP for 3 days\nHe then said I was a privileged customer and he could discount that to 428 including a 100 GBP deposit.\nAll the while indicating this was the cost of the car hire for 3 days\nIt wasn't -\nHe'd added\n2 extra days\nPremium Protection 5 days - 173.49 GBP\nRoadside Assistance 5 days - 65.47 GBP\n\nBegrudgingly I agreed to the amount of 328 + 100 deposit thinking this was the price of a car last minute in the middle of a rail strike.\nHe then pointed to certain x parts on the form to sign - I duly signed NOT realising he had added these EXTRAS.\nAfter getting in the car and driving home I double-checked the paperwork and was gobsmacked the actual hire cost for what I had ordered should be 45 GBP\nHe'd managed to slide in 239 GBP of extras (days and extras)\n\nI immediately called the bookings line of Europcar and this is where they really DO NOT CARE - AT ALL\nCall 1 - Put the phone down after my explanation\nCall 2 - Took my details but no reference number - Also said he could amend a booking to be bigger but could NOT amend a booking once it was paid even if it was wrong\nCall 3 - Customer services - he eventually made a case but had no details in it and kept me on hold for a very long time.\nHe would not give me any option to escalate\nHe only gave me the standard CS email\nHe also would not amend the booking even though we were 3 hours into the hire. He said he couldn't do anything once it was signed and paid for.\nHis comments were \"You should have checked the booking before signing it\" - Quite rudely\n\nIn that he's correct -\n\nWith Europcar I as an unsuspecting customer would expect to be misled - it seems an established practice to sell extras\nI would expect they add details that you never discussed and never asked for\nDo NOT sign anything until you've checked the dates, days, and extras plus the car.\nEuropcar is comfortably in my experience the worst hire company operating in the UK. I'd avoid them at any and all costs. It cost you an awful lot of money as I'm finding out."

The assistant advised me that since I had full premium insurance(as an additiona cost) it would not matter what was wrong with the car. Its just as well as the Car later turned out to be scuffed and had a chipped windscreen which was attributed to me. Had I not had this additional insurance it would have come out on my pocket. The moral of the story check the excess as the standard excess is 1600 pounds. As if that wasnt bad enough they added strange surchages to my bill for example a premium station surchage and other licence fees. These were not expected or explained. Now I am having to spend my time sorting this out with customer service. Not a great experience at Edingburgh Airport."

      "text": "I now live in Spain, and planning a visit to see family after Christmas in the UK, I visited various comparison sites for car hire. Using CarJet I booked a \"compact\" vehicle with KEDDY car hire & took out the CarJet 'zero excess' insurance cover with Avia to avoid the much more expensive one using Keddy.\nThe pick up was at South terminal Gatwick, at the EUROPCAR desk. ALL the paperwork was in the name of Europcar with no mention of Keddy at all.\nI was given the agreement to sign, and my credit card was charged with 'a holding charge' at NO time was I offered any insurance regarding 'zero excess' OR informed that I had taken this out. Had this been the case I would have refused as I already had cover in place. On reaching my daughters about 3 hours later I thought that the 'holding charge' seemed an odd amount ( £383)? On looking at the agreement, it appeared that I had been charged for Europcars PREMIUM 'zero excess' insurance. I immediately (only 3 hours after picking the car up) rang customer services, explained the situation and asked for the Isurance charge to be removed. The agent said she would report my request to an investigating agent and they would be in touch. I recieved an email with a case number. The hire was for 10 days, and after 8 days the 'pending payment' dissapeared from my credit card statement. Case closed I thought, although I had recieved no more communication from 'customer services'. The day after returning home a 'pending payment' once again appeared on my credit card, this time for £325! Once again on to 'customer services' a prolonged phone call, and being told that the case had been closed,I asked the agent to open a new one, which he did. I will say that the two agents at Customer Services were both courtious and as far as it goes 'understanding'\nI consider that the desk agent at Gatwick however, did dupe me into signing the agreement, which of course DID contain the insurance agreement. With my signiture on that agreement,of course it gives me no option of claiming a 'non authorized' payment with my credit card issuer.\nWhen doing research into Europcar, I found out that they also own GOLDCAR car hire, which in Spain is notorious for similar bad service and underhand actions."

This is a NO GO even if the car has AWD and it's absolutely illegal in many countries all over the world (but not in the UK).\nI came back and asked to be given another car and price difference refunded.\nI had to go on the parking slot for 1 hour to find the only car that had M+S (mud and snow) stamp on the tyre side-wall (the rest was a disaster with plenty of cars with 3 different summer tires and none of them had all season tyres).\nI said i want that one. It was an MG EHS Hybrid.\nPlease refund me the price difference.\nAfter pushing me to take all sort of insurance i told her i only want the bare minimum, i don't need all that crap.\nIn the end she charged me 1,387.50£ which was still more than 2 times the price that i was supposed to pay for almost the same car. MG EHS is a budget family SUV car that is worth 37,000€ in Belgium when bought new. In no way it can cost the double of a Mercedes CLA 200 AMG Line to be rented that costs 50,000eur.\nThis is a clear SCAM.\nOf course i couldn't check what the correct price would have been within their parameters by making a simulation online in their website but i knew i was definitely for sure getting scammed and i had no other choice than pay and go away.\nWhen i left the desk, after a few meters i see behind my shoulders the lady laughing with his colleague talking about me and laughing loudly, almost having a laughter.\nI have travelled all over the world, dealt with many renting companies like sixt, avis, europcar. But the very despicable way i was treated by this europcar agency is simply out of this world.\nSHAMEFUL!

      "text": "Beware, scam! Despite explicitly stating I do not wish any additional insurances or addons on pickup I was charged 110 GBP after the rental for several things like breakdown insurance, driver insurance etc. I already contacted customer support and they were unwilling to help in the matter. Very unfortunate that I will have to resort to a credit card chargeback. Clerks are trimmed to try and hide extra charges so you sign the contract without noticing them. It is bad enough they try this with people who do not know about this but it is REALLY bad when you explicitly decline and they still put it on the contract and then hide the section by conveniently placing another sheet of paper on top of that section of the contract. I only noticed until after I signed but then it was \"too late\" because I had already started the rental. I thought this was a reputable company... Stay away from Europcar!"

To which was absolutely fine by us, they charged him a £250 deposit fee (didn’t state this online but he agreed to it as it would be refunded upon return). It’s take FOUR weeks to refund it but has then charged him over £100 for the car when we paid £84 online?! Then after specifically telling them we didn’t want the extra insurance they charged it!!! Saying he signed to agree but we was literally waved a phone to sign with nothing on it. Which I can see happens a lot based on the other reviews here. Absolute JOKE of a company. They’re rude and unhelpful. Even went to the branch and they was just fobbing us off. Absolute robbing scamming company."

Never had an issue with a UK car rental company, until now - Merry Christmas I guess.\n- we pick up a car.\n- lady at the reception tells us to fill fuel back to existing level (3/4 full) on return.\n- on return 3 days later, we check the paperwork to double check, before going to petrol station.\n- the paper work does not stipulate level of petrol at check in, so we take the word of the kind lady at reception, and fill it back to 3/4 on the nose. I have a photo of our rental agreement and the staff did not circle the fuel status…\n-we arrive at drop of point to an unstaffed unit (all other companies had people there helping). No problem, we drop the keys in the letterbox and go get our flight.\n- two days later we receive a charge of £20 for fuel, and £18 to fill up plus tax, so another £40+ quid. Apparently we need to fill it to the top? Despite it being only 3/4 full when we got it? Is this really the policy? If yes this is a total scam\n\nAs I say, we have a photo of rental agreement without any direction on fuel level, so hopefully this is resolved quickly.\n\nJust FYI at Edinburgh airport there is an Avis and Budget car rental. We have used those before and never had any issues, they provide clear instruction, and honour their word and do not try and scam their customers. We will be using them next time and suggest anyone reading to as well.\n\nAlso I haven’t even got to the excess cover option on the insurance - at check in they tried to double our rental cost with this (£25 a day!!!).

In my opinion, no matter how much you think you may need something moving, or even if you’re just desperate for a vehicle quickly, you should avoid Europcar.\n\nWe rented a van in October this year for a single day & didn't pay for the additional 'premium protection' offered. On the day, the staff at the front desk were helpful and the process of actually picking a vehicle up was quick & easy.\n\nWe were given a much larger van than we had paid for, as this was the only one available & unfortunately I caused some minor damage to the side of the van (knocked off a plastic protector panel with some reflectors).\n\nAfter hearing nothing for 3 months, we finally received a bill from Europcar for £1,500 (the maximum I could be charged) for damage caused; the attached invoices included a figure over £2,000 to fix a small dent in the van!\n\nAnyone with basic knowledge in this area can tell you this is an absurd & ridiculous amount for such a repair. My assumption is that such inflated figures exist purely to ensure people hit their maximum excess when causing damage of any sort.\n\nWe'll never use this company again.

We booked through car jet and took Car jet insurance which wasn’t a problem, as normal. The second time the staff member convinced us to take their insurance with 50% off and guaranteed we would be refunded by Car jet that this happened all the time. The next day doing as he instructed, I contacted Car jet they refused. Upon our return with the car we were told it wasn’t Europcars problem. To add insult to injury they’ve taken more money off the card for the insurance, then we agreed to. I work in hospitality in customer service and there’s one thing I never do and that is rip people off and misinform them. We have been in contact back-and-forth with the company who are just fobbing us off. 35 years I have worked in this industry and it’s the wrong way to treat people.

I originally looked at the detail on easyjet website and buried in the terms and conditions it stated that i would be charged something for crossing the border but nothing about how much it would be. I got the invoices the next day and all the vat charges were incorrect. I now have been sent something that says I was charged for premium station and also got hit with extra charges on the upgrade. I have no idea whats going on. Its a complete racket and I would strongly advise anyone against using them for the their complete lack of transparency and terrible customer service. I live in Scotland and go back to Ireland at least 5 times a year. Typically the charge has been ~£30. I found the whole experience completely unacceptable for a modern professional service and really surprised that Easyjet allows such practices. Avoid if you can.\n\nAnd a response as expected!"

Emailed to ask for evidence, none received, yet £21 admin fee taken form my account. I have had to contact my bank to ask them to put a freeze on subsequent amounts and to investigate into all of the complaints I have. Similarly the car hire insurance I took out through Swinton have also been informed. So far I have had an extra charge of £100 for an upgraded car I did not ask for. A potential claim of over £500 for a scratch that was already on the car when I collected it, and now this admin fee of £21. I will try to avoid them but the problem is I hired a car as an add on to flights. We often use Jet2 but they then passed the car hire on to Europcar, so in future I will either not hire a car through the airline or specifically avoid Europcar in future.

I have rented cars from numerous rental companies and never had one single issue. Rented from this lot through a 3rd party who I had taken full insurance with, so the car and full insurance for €370.\nA day after I had dropped the car back, Europcar charged me €345 for insurance with themselves which was never mentioned once by the desk agent but was put into the contract as saying I had agreed to it. Why on earth would I agree to insuring a car that’s already insured for a price that’s nearly same as my original full rental price. When the desk agent gave me the documents to read she immediately started showing me pictures on her phone of some wedding photos asking me what I thought of the quality of them etc. basically distracting me so I wouldn’t notice the additional insurance she put in the contract. She intentionally robbed me, I have no doubt about it. I have since contacted the police to get CCTV footage of the rental centre so I have evidence of the desk agent distracting me after giving me the documents, I will then be taking legal action. I would have been a returning customer as I have a few trips planned to this same place in the coming months so they have immediately lost out on 3 or 4 times the money they’re after stealing from me.

They force you to take extra insurance, threatening that you cannot take vehicles until you do.\n\nEveryone at the company says a different thing and then deny it and lose notes and complaints, their customer service is non existent and all they care about is taking as much money from customers as possible.\n\nI wish I had read the reviews before renting a vehicle through them, there are so many illegal activities happening that they need to be closed down!\n\nI warn you not to use them, you will regret it! Also, do not be fooled by their standardised template response to all these negative reviews asking you to submit a complaint, they won't do anything, they write that to show that they care about customers but they don't.\n\nThis is the worst company I have ever dealt with and I guarantee this company will not be around in a few years, eventually their illegal activities will be investigated."

The courtesy car with an engine light failure is still in my possession. I'm anxious to drive the vehicle due to breaking down in the middle of nowhere. The branch is no longer answering any of my calls, so i've now given up and resulted to taking London transport and taxi's to work meetings. I will report back to my insurance company today."

Spent 2 days waiting for their arrival and they weren't even bothered to notify me that you weren't coming ( excuse later was that they didn't have drivers available to do it) . Wasted 2 days of my life waiting for Europcar's non arrival. Insurance company requested prestige car for me, they gave me 2019 (4 years old) heavily damaged all around and smelly Ford Focus and assured me that once the promised prestige car becomes available, they will exchange it as Ford Focus was meant to be temporary. The hire lasted over a month and Europcar didn't even offer to exchange their dingy Focus for prestige car despite promises. Awful company and I will avoid them at all costs in the future. Liars sorry to say."

Car didn't show up, so called them and after several frustrating hours of phone calls they denied the delivery date stating the car was booked i for the 15th december. to be fair i was fairly rude to the initial person who booked the car and i think she changed the date just to annoy me. I'd say they're the worst company I have ever dealt with, but that prize is already taken by aviva!!"

      "text": "This review is a warning not to fall for scare tactics when it comes to their premium cover. If you still feel you need additional cover than what they offer as standard shop about. There are dozens of places that offer more comprehensive cover and for a fraction of the cost. £220 for a week is scandalous and its pure profit for them. You can get better elsewhere for about £40 for the week. No wonder they are so keen to offer it. The finacial incetives for the sales person and the fact that they are probably targeted means they have to be pushy with it. My partner however fell for this. She needed a hire car as ours was having some work done and she needed to get home to say her goodbyes to her dying Grandmother. She booked the car online and went to pick it up. She'd read through the cover options and selected the one she required which was the standard one. That didn't stop the person behind the counter laying on the spiel about how much it will cost her if anything were to happen. They were aware of her predicament before hand and also knew she had to make haste but that doesn't stop them. Laying it on thick for someone who already had enough to worry about. In hidsight she knew she should have cancelled when she got down the road and realised that she'd been fleeced but as I said, she had other things on her mind. It's pushy sales tactics that pray and people insecurities to flog an overpriced product. Thankfully there are other more affordable options available elsewhere otherwise I'd suggest this con by the hirecare companies should be looked in to. I did make a complaint about how it was sold to an already vulnerable person but it fell on deaf ears. They're not that interested. She'd signed a contract and that was that. Very little contrition on there part knowing full well how they operate and how much they charge, knowing full well their options are a million miles from being competitive.\n\nJusy say no and shop about if you feel you need it.\n\nI await the stock response saying how sorry they are and that they will look in to it. Just empty words.\nComplaint case number is 18052138"

When picking up the car I was told by the agent to hand over my debit card and thought that was for a deposit as usual. Then a couple of days later I realised I was charged for a way more expensive insurance I didn't ask for - and my original insurance was cancelled. I feel like I was ripped off and totally misled by the insurance switch. I obviously signed the contract but tbh the document wasn't that straightforward so ended up signing without fully acknowledge it. I then reached out to customer support and the macro response was \"As the rental agreement and additional product form have been signed in acceptance of the product, the request for the charge to be refunded has been respectfully declined.\"\n\nI am certainly no longer a customer and strongly advise choosing a more transparent provider."

      "text": "At around 17.45 on 01/11/2023 I had a car delivered from Europcar as a courtesy car for Motability whilst my own car is off the road & in the garage, I didn't use the car until the following morning. But when I started the engine a tyre pressure warning light came on, I called Europcar to report this along with a couple of other things that weren't on their damage list given to me at handover. But all they said was that I had to report it via their damage email. After this call I went out in the vehicle, only to find it drove really heavy & that I had to push the accelerator almost fully down to get any sort of power when crossing a roundabout.\nMy daughter-in-law drove it on 04/11/2023 & said that it was horrible to drive (she has driven an identical car to this, as her mum had one & that one did not drive like this one) & even you paid her she wouldn't get behind the wheel of that car again. I have been sent from one person to another, been told different things by different people, been spoken abruptly to, (was even told that because my name is spelt wrong on the rental agreement that my insurance wouldn't be valid, it is) so much so that I ended up contacting Motability, bursting into tears on the phone & getting them to try to sort things.\nDue to this software/electrical issues with my own car I became afraid to drive it incase it went wrong whilst I was using it, hence my getting a courtesy vehicle from Europcar, but can honestly say that I felt safer driving my own car than this hire car. I have been placed on a list for a replacement vehicle, but not given any eta on this happening, even though I told them that I need a safe working car due to a couple of personal things.\nThis company despite having a contract with Motability to supply courtesy vehicles to those on the Motability scheme when their own vehicle breaks down & is in the garage, meaning they should keep so many aside for this purpose, but do NOT. Yet, they don't give motability customers the same customer service that they give cash paying customers (those that hire a vehicle through the normal channels, via walk in, website or phone) They treat Motability customers like second class citizens, this car is a prime example of that as it should never have been sent out with any warning lights lit up on the dashboard yet it was sent out to me, something that would not have happened had I been a paying customer. If I were a paying customer I would avoid this hire company like the plague & will NEVER recommend it to anyone.\n\nUpdate:\n\nOn 06/11/2023, I wrote the above review, which Europcar replied to (see below) asking me to contact them on the website in said reply. However, is you go to this sight & click on the email icon, it gives you 3 options, the 2nd applies to me as it is an issue during rental, then it gives you another list of options, none of which applies to me, meaning I can't use this option to contact them as they request in order for them to resolve my issues. Again, if I didn't have a Motability car currently in the garage you couldn't pay me to use Europcar. If I could give them 0 stars then believe me I would 100% do that, I will also tell anyone thinking of using them to run in the opposite direction & find a different hire company to use. These in my honest opinion are one of the worst vehicle hire companies around"

My insurance arranged everything. The car was delivered to my house and we went through all the procedures. But before using the car, I had took all the precautions, I took all the photos of scratches, alloy, fuel gauge and mileage just to cover my back.\n\nI recieved this car on the 5th of September 2023 and my car was fixed and returned in the morning on the 8th of September. Anyway I informed them straight away to come and collect their car but never did until the 15th of September, which wasnt an issue to me as the Car was parked securely at home.\n\nOn the 15th someone came to collect the car, he just came and took the car without doing all the procedure and I asked him why he wasnt checking and he said he was just asked to collect the car. After a day I recieved a letter saying I had not filled back the fuel which I did and had receipts and photos of the fuel gauge of the before and after. After all the explanation they said it was in error and didnt need to pay anything.\n\nTo my surprise, on the 26th of October 2023 after over a month they send me a letter saying I had damaged the alloy wheels. What a joke! It took them over a month to check the car but they had checked the fuel guage the following day after collection and wanted to RIP me off and failed and now they sending me false damages after over a month of having the car. The car shouldn't have been driven from my house without doing proper procedures the same procedure you did when you dropped it. Whoever collected the car could have done those damages you're are claiming was me. Why collecting a car without making sure all procedures are followed.\n\nI'm glad I covered my back by taking before and after photos of everything and im happy to be going to Court if I have to as I have all the evidence I need. I would not be paying a penny to this SHAM of a company. They have definitely destroyed thier own reputation by ripping off people left and right.\n\nI wonder how they sleep at night...ain't we all struggling!"

I choose a MG at a cost of GBP 318.\n\nArriving at the counter at Manchester the show began. Everything in my online booking was questioned, which is exactly what I want to avoid making an online booking, i.e. risking saying yes to something that is not fully transparent. What is the point then of making a online booking?\n\nI was asked whether I wanted a manual or automatic. I was not informed about any price difference and in my naivity thought it was because they had excess automatics. At no point in time was I informed that it came with an additional cost.\n\nI was asked about navigation. I said no thanks and I do not know whether I have paid for it. I cannot see it from the very little informative invoice.\n\nI was asked about insurance. I said 3 or 4 times that I wanted the insurance packaged I had ticked of in the online booking. It turned out I got a much more expensive solution. Again I was not informed about the difference in cost.\n\nI was offered a VW passat instead of the MG booked online. Luckily I said no, despite the fact that I was asked if I was sure 4-5 times. I bet that also came with an additional cost that I was not informed about.\n\nI was not taken through the rental agreement, but was only shown were to sign, which I did in my naivity. I just received the invoice, GBP 776, more than twice the preferred solution in my online booking.\n\nNo wonder that we were only two persons at the Europcar counter whilst the Avis counter had 10-15 people queuing. I guess it is back to Avis.\n\nTaking a look at the review of the various Europcar entities here on trustpilot, Europcar UK stands out as the worst scoring Europcar entity. My experience is completely in line and follow the same pattern as all the other unsatisfied customers reviews in here. Complete lack of customer care.\n\nI have filed a complaint to Europcar UK, but got a fairly standard answer. Of course they rejected to pay back anything.\n\nUpdate 6 November: No response using the link. after two complaints via mail both with negative response, I have been directed towards BVRLA!!"
