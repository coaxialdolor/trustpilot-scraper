I used my digital card to make a booking online, not knowing i needed to present a physical card in branch, I’ve been told I can’t get a refund as the package is non refundable, it was a honest mistake and should be looked at as such.

                <div class='text'>I had a great rental experience with Europcar last week and it was all because of Tami at the Heathrow pick up desk on the N Perimeter Rd at Heathrow. Efficient, polite and helpful all through the pick up process he's a credit to the company. The car was clean, in great condition and drop off was super efficient a couple of days later. Very good experience. Thank you!</div>

                <div class='text'>Europcar took 3 payments out of wife's bank account twice for identical sums of money. She is still waiting for a refund and being fed a load of lies from Europcar even with them having accepted liability for the error and told her that the money was released 2 weeks ago. Its now a month since it happened. On top of this, the car has been returned and their pre authorisations have not been released and the deposit has not been returned.
Their continued moving of timelines and this behavior has to be illegal as I do not understand how they can simply take money out of a bank account when the customer has not authorised it. Tesco can't do that with shopping.</div>

                <div class='text'>The booking.com website led me to Keddy by Europcar at Valencia airport in July with the promise of "no queues" but I had to wait more than 30 minutes to collect on arrival. I reserved a "T-Roc or similar" and tried to pre-empt me not getting "or similar" by contacting Europcar (Madrid) in advance. They responded with a "we cannot promise anything" and indeed when I arrived was given a Hyundai Tucson covered in scratches with a flogged engine 65k on the clock. Europcar then pre-authorised 800 Euros on my credit card in case of collision even though I had paid an extra 70 pounds to booking.com for full additional insurance (excess insurance). I hated the Hyundai Tucson. The safety features were infuriating with the parking brake auto-hold not having a light on the console and the locked patrol cap. The staff were very polite at Europcar Valencia airport but the experience was a let-down. One week after returning the car I noticed a further charge from Europcar on my credit card. When I contacted them they said it was an "environmental contribution" charged to me in error when it should have been charged to the intermediary (i.e. booking.com). Long story short I would avoid using either Europcar or booking.com for a car rental in the future.</div>

                <div class='text'>Avoid

I rented a car for a month in June 2025. The collection was smooth although, while the car had been washed, it had not been wiped dry and so was covered with water marks. I inspected the car reasonably thoroughly and could not see any damage.

On returning the car the member of staff immediately identified what she claimed was damage but to my mind was a mark on the rear bumper that was hardly visible and not possible to see without wiping away the water marks. Nevertheless, the staff member required me to sign the Statement of Return acknowledging the damage. She told me that is it was the only way I would get my deposit back and also implied that the damage would be assessed by an expert and would probably not be an issue. As I was in a hurry to catch my flight I signed document.</div>

                <div class='text'>Unbelievable experience with this awful company and the partner companies I have had to deal with.
Booked a Citroen C3 fuel car for 12 days in Tolouse in late July. (almost £300 total) . I used the GOTrentalcars website to book the car from Europcar.

My Ryanair flight was late so I got to the Europcar at 12.30am. They did not have the Citroen C3. They insisted I had booked an electric car of the lowest category. ( Major Red Flag) I insisted I hadn't because I deliberately excluded electric cars when booking. The electric car they wanted to give me could only drive for 1 hour before needing charging. I would never have willingly booked this.

They only had 1 fuel car to offer me but it was going to cost an extra £60 PER DAY!!! I was absolutely stuck, I had a young child with me and it was 1am on a saturday night, I had to drive for 1.5 hours to get to our accomodation. I was forced to get the fuel car at £60 extra per day but they said I could try and explain the next day and change it. All day Sunday and Monday was ruined because I was trying to sort out the situation on the phone and eventually just had to go back to return the car and try to get refunded for the 10 days. But they still have not refunded me. ( RED FLAG - staff directly lied to me)
However the Europcar staff at Toulouse airport were completely UNHELPFUL and RUDE. RED FLAG. I had an argument with them in the Toulouse airport. I parked the car near their returns office and went away for an hour.

When I came back to return the car, they said there was a dimple on the rear door. RED FLAG! I KNOW that I hadn't ever touched this door or seen the dimple when I checked the car over. I think they did it out of malice for my complaining. I asked to check cctv but there wasnt any. They forced me to sign a thing saying I had created the dimple. I definitely did not. It is so small that I took a close-up photo and you still can't see it. They have taken £800 out of my bank account. They have not even refunded me 10 days' worth of £ that I had paid.

Every staff member that I spoke to from GOTrental cars and Europcar says I signed the contract in the first place for the car. I keep saying I was FORCED to sign it because I was stuck in the middle of the night with a child and they did not have the car I had booked. I am being totally GASLIT by these theiving, tricking, fraudulent blatant liars, and they now owe me £1200 plus 2 days of my holiday plus petrol and toll money to return the wrong car.

THEY WILL NOT GET AWAY WITH THIS.</div>

                <div class='text'>After using this company for car rentals quite often over a few years, I thought I'd grown to trust them as one of the better car rental companies that weren't out to scam you at every possible opportunity.

Unfortunately, I was proven wrong when I was handed a cleaning fee for having some dirt, from a shoe, in the footwell of the car. This was deemed excessive and upon querying the matter, I was told this would require 'expert third party cleaners ' and 'the cleaning of a interior specialist'.

Direct quotes, yet evidence of this was never produced and I was ignored for over a month before receiving a dismissive email saying they will not be replying any more.

If only photos were allowed on this platform to show how little dirt was apparently deemed to be excessive. I have since moved to using other car rental companies, as this lack of customer service for a long-standing customer, or anyone, is just not good enough.

I will be reporting them to the British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association for breaching their code of conduct in their handling of this matter.</div>

                <div class='text'>I booked a hire car and paid for it using my Monzo card, got a train to Gatwick Airport and brough this card with me like the booking confirmation said to. I hired another vehicle with Europcar earlier this year and had no problems paying the deposit using this card.

Got to the branch to be told by staff that they don't accept Monzo so I couldn't hire the car. Nobody could explain why this was their policy, only that they had to cancel the booking.

I offered to make a full payment for the deposit amount which could be refunded when I returned the car, but the staff weren't having it either. I spoke to the branch manager, who could only tell me that they didn't accept Monzo and I'd have to cancel my booking.

This policy seems to be based on the understanding that Monzo cards aren't "real debit cards", which doesn't seem to be true.

In the end, I had to ask my friend to travel to the branch with another card, and Europcar refuse to cover the costs of this even though (1) they literally told me to bring the card I used to pay for the booking and (2) their terms say they accept debit cards.

Europcar's customer service have just ignored my attempts to get them to refund me for these costs, or to at least explain their policy. Useless.

If anyone from Europcar reads this, my case number is 23955880.</div>

                <div class='text'>I’m very disappointed with this group
I got a lawyers letter through this morning which I have been asked to pay for damage to the car I hired from the 29/05/2025 to the 02/06/2025.i never got anything back from them regarding this and as far I knew everything was ok.
I since tried to call the lawyers and was on the phone for 1.5 hours to get someone. I gave up on that and called the head office of Europcar to discuss the matter. The woman name was lynne who insisted that they had sent a email for recovery of damage. I then checked my junk mail and found 2 emails from Europcar. One was the invoice from them on the 04/06/2025 saying the car was ok and the deposit would be returned
Which it was by Europcar.

Then on the the 23/06/2025 I have another email regarding the damage to the car ( which was a flat tyre and I picture of the tyre with the nail in it.
3 weeks after the so called nail was in the tyre they contact me to inform me that I must of done it and they were going to charge me for the time it was off the road a new tyre and admin fees of 251.64. Something I did not know about til now.
I know I checked the car out and it did not have a puncture as I checked all aspects at of it with a friend who assisted me in the process. At no point was the car damaged or anything wrong with it.
How can this company say the car was ok and issue an invoice on the 4th June 2025 and then 3 weeks later decide that the car had a puncture and decide to send me a bill.
They must of done this when driving the car round the car park or someone else who hired it and the only person they could blame was the last person who drove it. This is wrong on all levels and I will contest it as it looks like they are blaming anyone they can. Absolute disgrace from Europcar and as a company I used to use regularly I won’t be using again and I will tell anyone who is using this company do not use them as they are not true to there words of being a good company who cares about the drivers.</div>

                <div class='text'>Booking No. 1192827246 – Terrible Experience

If I could rate this company 0 stars, I would. Europcar is a scam company that happily takes money from customers but doesn’t provide the car you booked. They confirmed my reservation and took my payment without doing the necessary checks. I travelled all the way to London City Airport, only to be told I couldn’t collect the car.

This company wastes people’s time and money, and it feels like they take bookings just to hold customers’ money for their own interest. Disgraceful service, no accountability, and a complete scam. Avoid Europcar at all costs.</div>

                <div class='text'>I receive a hire car after an accident. It was a Volvo XC60. I get the car, drive to the supermarket, comeback and the car is dead. Bearing in mind I am due to go on a family holiday in a couple of hours.
I can’t get in touch with Birmingham Newtown branch. I manually manage to open the key fob and the limp the car to the branch who swap it over.
So I have had to return an unsafe car. When it comes to pick up the car after chasing me despite me telling them that it will be returned when my repairs are done they can’t be bothered to pick up the car and I have to wait again for them to pick them up.
I return the car will a full tank and the engineer marks
The paper work to reflect that. I then get just under £20 taken out of my account being told the tank wasn’t full.
I have sent them their own paperwork and have asked for a refund. I spoke to monosyllabic customer service agent who didn’t initially understand the issue. The whole experience has been shocking. Truly truly awful experience. I am now chasing my refund as a point of princible.</div>

They told me at the rental desk that I could bring the fuel tank back at any level and they would fill it up at cost price for no extra charge.
2 days after I had returned the car with 7/8 full tank, they charged me £67!!
No responses to emails sent to complain, and unable to do anything on the phone.

                <div class='text'>Daylight Robbery. Had to cancel my booking from Inverness Airport branch as my flight was cancelled . I foolishly hadn't checked every square millimetre of the website to find the 'refundable booking' button when I made the reservation so got charged the full value of the booking (£748.00) which included all the insurance waivers, extra driver even though clearly never used, surprised they didn't charge me for some fuel as well! In the end, we had to hire a car in Huntingdon and drive up to Scotland, and as Europcar had said they would refund me the full amount and didn't have a branch in Huntingdon, we used Enterprise - brilliant service, better car and cost £50 less anyway despite being a one-way hire with unlimited mileage. Will never use Europcar, ever.</div>

                <div class='text'>Scammers, extremely shady outfit.

I picked up my car in Johannesburg and they tried to give me a car without a damage report, telling me “it will be fine”.

Upon checking the car it had clearly been in some form of accident. It took an hour of refusing to take the car without damage report for them to finally say they would bring me a new car at my address later, but that I should take this one for now (I assume they then would have said the car was damaged by in the time between me taking it and them brining the new one).

Travelling with a newborn, this was stressful and they eventually brought me a new car with a damage report and assured me that I had the maximum insurance. Unfortunately this was not the case as I was hit by a driver running a red light and Europcar took £2000 from me.

Be careful, these guys are extremely shady.</div>

                <div class='text'>Classic case of should have read this before we booked.
Complete shambles from start to finish.
Tried to add a booster seatto our booking, which wasn't possible. Tried to reach customer service which was impossible.
When we collected the car, they wanted 100€ for a booster seat. Even in Switzerland it costs about 15€ to buy one (which we did!).
They then told us we needed a Vignette to drive in Switzerland (another 40 CHF). When we tried to buy one online it transpired the car already had one (of course it did, they are valid for a year). The police confirmed when we asked.
Why oh why would you make your customers' lives more difficult?

                <div class='text'>Truly awful service for disabled customers – avoid if you can

If you are disabled and rely on Motability, avoid Europa Car Belfast at all costs. Unfortunately, they have the contract with Motability for hire cars if your vehicle breaks down – but that “service” is virtually non-existent.

They rarely answer the phone, and when they finally do, they lie. I was told a car would be ready for me in 2 days. That never happened. A week later, I still have no car, no update, and no way of knowing when (or if) I’ll get one.

I am disabled and live in a remote area with no access to shops or medical appointments without a vehicle. This delay has left me completely stranded and put my health at risk. The lack of care or urgency for a disabled customer’s needs is absolutely shocking.

Europa Car Belfast have shown themselves to be unreliable, dishonest, and completely unsympathetic to the needs of vulnerable people. If you have any other option, take it – because you cannot count on them.</div>

                <div class='text'>Hired a car from the Gloucestershire branch, when asked if I needed to know anything about driving in the UK all I was told you drive on the same side of the road as in Australia. I returned the vehicle some 25 hours before the due date and time and never received a refund. Upon my return to Australia I received an email and infringement notice to say I drove in the coach lane at Manchester Airport for 34 seconds. I paid this fine and also received a further invoice of 45 UK pound for Europcar for passing on the original fine. When I questioned this I received an email to say my query was being investigated and I would be notified soon. I did not received a refund for the early return of the car and I advised Europecar UK to use that money to cover the cost of typing my email address to cover the costs of passing on the infringement fine. Europcar UK charged my credit card without my knowledge for the said 45 UK pound. To use my credit card without my authorization is criminal and I believe this to be corporate fraud. I am still await the 'outcome' of Europcar UK investigation. Would NOT recommend Europcar UK to any future hirers.</div>

                <div class='text'>I am giving this Company a 1 star review, because I cannot give them any less.
I was given a hire 'car' by my insurance company while mine was being repaired. I am nearly 70 and need a car to get around, so when my car went in for some repairs, the repair company stated that their courtesy cars were too small for me, (I am quite tall) Europcar were my insurers choice to give me a suitable car. They contacted me top say that they had not got an SUV as requested, but would give me something as close to an SUV as possible. What they supplied was a 9seater mini bus.
I tried to contact them to explain that the 'car' was not suitable but every time I called, I was constantly put on hold. I even completed their contact us form only for them to send me a standard reply email 2 weeks after the van had been returned. Do not accept anything from this firm unless you are happy with the size of vehicle and the condition. make sure that you take an all round video just in case they try to con you for damage that you have not caused.</div>

                <div class='text'>CROOKS. Booked in advance but because they wouldnt accept different cards we had we were forced to take out their insurance for the week which was more than the cost of the car hire. We had arranged our own insurance at a tenth of the price but they would not even look at the paperwork. It was late with only a few other companies open and limited availability. When I asked why the insurance was so high they said it was a local insurance company. Never given a policy document just €268 item on the bill. We still had to pay a deposit. Read other reviews and see this is a common scam by them.</div>

They arranged for a LWB van to be delivered and this had a front tyre that was 1/3 bald ! The driver said you can take it to Kwikfit and they will change it for you , as it's our problem we willpay for it ! Oh yeah , sure I'm going to waste a few hours of my time for a problem caused by them. On top of that he said he saw the Luton was missing the number plate the day before , but thought he would keep quiet and not report it to the office !!! Unbelievable .... Then they would not answer the phone at the local depot and I did not get a hire at all ! I wish Trustpilot gave you the option to give a minus score s it would be -5 ! Don't use them is my recommendation.</div>

                <div class='text'>False advertising from Europcar:

I booked an EV for a holiday in Spain. Online booking process says "full recharge not required" – but the collection desk argued I must recharge it before returning it.

They finally agreed when I showed them the website, and said they'd make a note on my booking. Obviously my choice was either sign the paperwork and trust them, or leave with no car for my holiday (plus they'd keep my deposit?).

So I had to trust them, and when I got home they invoiced me for recharging the car and took the payment from my credit card.

When I filed a dispute, they just replied saying that's the terms I agreed to when I signed. I keep asking about the false advertising, but they just ignore that question.

Won't use them again as this broke my trust.</div>

                <div class='text'>We returned our car to Izmir Airport on 21/06/25, and as of 13/08/25 are yet to have our €300 security deposit returned.

We have made multiple phone calls and emails to attempt to get this resolved and are yet to hear anything back. We waited 30 working days, as advised, before emailing the Customer Service UK email address on 01/06/25, and only received a NoReply, automated response on 06/08/25 with no real update or additional information regarding our query- it was clear that it was sent automatically and not by a real person.

Europcar are contractually obliged to return this money to us, yet we do not have it- or any correspondence from them about it at all!

We will begin pursuing legal action if we do not hear back or receive our money back by the end of the week.

This is unfortunate because the car itself was lovely and the staff in Turkey very helpful, and the staff who assisted in making the booking were also helpful. We only went with Europcar because we believed them to be reputable, but will not be using them again after this experience.

If Europcar would like to reach out as a response to this review then I would very much welcome it, as all we really want at this point is our money back. I will be happy to provide our booking reference if so.</div>

                <div class='text'>I had a prepaid car rental voucher for a predetermined type vehicle through a third-party provider. I went to collect the vehicle from EuropCar Gatwick South Terminal to be told by the female EuroCar employee that the vehicle we ordered was not available. She said “We are giving you a free upgrade”. No mention of cost we would pay etc. because we were told they were GIVING us an upgrade. GIVING! It is my understanding that under law, if the company cannot provide the car ordered (and paid for) they must offer either a free upgrade or a lesser vehicle with a monetary refund, The upgrade was a very luxurious vehicle and I was immediately resistant and anxious and expressed deep concern to her, I was told by the female agent not to worry, the vehicle was at the end of its rental life, it had 50,000 miles on the odometer, which it did, and it was to be disposed of when I returned it. Reluctantly I accepted it. I felt it had been foisted upon me. When I was outside loading the car, the female agent came out and said the car had damaged wheels and I had to sign a form to acknowledge the damage. She presented form with a diagram of the car, both sides, with X marks on the wheels. I now realise she had folded the paper in half so that I couldn’t see what was on the other side. I really thought the shonky, trickster days of car hire had long gone. Boy was I wrong!!!
In hindsight I should have said NO! NO! NO and I should have run away, screaming, and rung the third-party provider and complained, but I didn’t, fool that I am. However, after 26 hours of travel I was exhausted, and yes, I now know I was dimwitted not to spot a scam in the making.
I hated the car from the start. This car wrecked my entire holiday and nearly wrecked me. I was highly anxious when I drove it and it made me quite ill from worry, It was too large and too wide for UK parking spaces. It literally got stuck in the entry to a shopping centre car park. It gave my daughter high level anxiety attacks. I had to try to park it away from other cars because I was terrified they would dent the car’s doors. This car was just too big,and too wide for UK narrow roads, even some A roads were scary and it did things I found hard to accept. It was so technical it was dangerous, simply because it was distracting.
But just as importantly, mechanically it was difficult. When the car started off there were many times when it just didn’t want to change up gears. Leaving Cobham Services, the car wouldn’t change gears at all and I held my breath thinking I would need a tow truck, but eventually it did change up. I am used to driving a Subaru with CVT automatic, but this vehicle had a habit of just stopping and not moving off. It would stop and go into Neutral and once you realised why the car wasn’t moving and what had happened, you had to go through the set process to get it going again. This happened in dangerous places at times like waiting to enter a large roundabout on a 70mph road. A friend suggested I return the car and I jolly well wish I had.
On the day I had to return the car to Gatwick, a yellow message about the tyres appeared on the consol. 8 calls to EuropCar proved useless and so I drove just down the road to the local dealership for the marque. Service personnel said it was ok to drive it back and gave me instructions as to what to do with the gadget in the trunk should tyre pressure deteriorate. And this is how I returned the car.
During the term of the car hire I did check my credit card several times to see if EuropCar had levied the £1500 block for security and I was surprised they had not. I returned the car on 1 August and flew home. The day after I arrived home, I checked my credit card and found that at between the 29 July and 9 August (8 days after I had returned the car) EuropCar had charged me $3,630.06 in my money for the upgrade they told me they were GIVING me because they were unable to supply the car I had ordered and prepaid for. It was then that I remembered the woman who asked me to sign the document acknowledging the damage to the car, and it was then that I realised she had folded the document in half and therefore I could not see what was on the other side-the upgrade charges etc.What a Fool I am
I have lodged a dispute but EuropCarUK is notorious for completely ignoring disputes. I am told that what this woman did could be a criminal offence called Fraudulent Misrepresentation. Some could ask whether she is highly skilled in the dark arts of duplicity and deception? Of course I will not be letting this matter go and others in the travel and insurance industries have been advised. Eventually when I can confidently tell the Citizens Advice Bureau,Trading Standards,Watchdog and Rip-off Britain that EuropCar has done absolutely nothing to resolve my dispute,then I will lodge a dispute with the BVRLA to whom EuropCar belong.</div>

                <div class='text'>I booked a car for the month of August 25 and needed to make a small correction to the pickup location all other details remained the same - duration timings etc. I notified the customer care department almost immediately to explain the situation. I was subsequently notified that there was nothing they could do with 5 days notice before pickup and that I would either need to pick up the car as per the original booking or lose the rental money 840 pounds. I am on holiday, required the car for the duration of the holiday and was forced to rent another car whilst I contest the problem - simply ridiculous people.
I got no help from customer care, I raised a claim ( complaint) and was told the SLA for turnaround was up to 5 working days. Needless to say no reply to the complaint, it’s like pulling teeth with the zombies in customer care and now need to take them to an arbitration court.
Be very careful folk, this is a company that I have since found out are notorious for this type of thing and other abuses.

                <div class='text'>What an absolute disgrace of a company . I am disabled and my car went in for repair so Europcar were the insurers choice for rental car . Rang and rang them for hrs for three days constant when this clown place was to arrange a vehicle for me . They rang and left a message seven days after and my car had been repaired and returned . I couldn’t go out while this disgusting company didn’t arrive with my rental . Worse company I’ve ever dealt with and have heard they regularly let disabled drivers down and are rude without any empathy !!!</div>

                <div class='text'>We have had so much trouble with this company we are with Motability and three times we have had issues in the last month just trying to get a courtesy vehicle while our car goes into the garage.
No phone call from them to say they have a vehicle or they don’t just leaving us not knowing what’s going on. Would definitely not recommend if you are in need of a courtesy car or to talk to you just get fobbed off and then the line goes dead when they redirect you or they just don’t answer.</div>

                <div class='text'>We have been waiting at Dublin airport for 2 hours for car and it is still “ being washed” with no exact time as to when it will be ready. Staff friendly but not helpful - they just keep saying it’s other people’s faults for not returning car quick enough and they can’t give us a time frame!!! We have a disabled elderly person with us who needs to eat but staff unconcerned about this as we stand waiting in their crowded office for hours with no cafe anywhere nearby. We also have 4 people waiting in Dublin City for us so we will be missing the first half day of our holiday! I would definitely NOT recommend this company! I am watching people quickly collect their cars from other providers!
I wish I’d read reviews before booking with this company. I will never use again!</div>

                <div class='text'>If I could rate as 0 I would do. Worst experience of any car hire company in my life. Our flight was delayed with Jet2 by 2 hours. They charged us for our flight being late. They checked the car over after the rental period, everything was fine and the employee signed the rental off. A month later we were charged £100 for out of hours, and £100 for our car needing to be cleaned. The Spanish guy we spoke to was like a robot and would not let us speak to a manager or give us a manager's email and only blandly gave us the basic customer services number. Please do not use this car hire firm. They are the worst sort of people to do business with and you could magically have £200 taken from your credit card and be in an utter battle to get it refunded.</div>

                <div class='text'>We had to get a car from Eurocar as our mobility car needed to go in for repair. When handed back they charged my card 50 pounds, i disputed it and they said actually we should have been charged 30, still I would debate. I cancelled them taking anymore money from me but every couple of days they are trying to take 30 pounds remembering I have already overpaid and I am awaiting a refund. Customer service hang up now as we would like our refund instead of paying them money, formal complaint don’t reply. Receiving texts saying we owe them money. Been so stressful. I can’t believe the mobility scheme use them. This is a horrible experience. If you would like to feel abused then call Eurocar.</div>

                <div class='text'>I’m extremely disappointed with Europcar. When I picked up my car at Birmingham Airport, I clearly declined additional protection cover, as I had already purchased my own insurance.
Despite this, I was still charged £281.57 for an extra package I never agreed to. The agent made no effort to explain the charges, and I only realised later when the amount appeared on my invoice.
This feels like a deliberate upsell — especially knowing that staff may be incentivised to add extras. Europcar refused to refund me, so I’ve had to escalate to the BVRLA and my credit card provider.

                <div class='text'>Rented from Europcar Luton Airport and had a terrible experience.

1️⃣ Hidden & Duplicate Charges
My booking clearly stated that Airport Surcharge and Vehicle Licence Fee were prepaid. But after returning the car, I was charged again for: Licenses and Fees &
Premium Station Surcharge

Europcar claimed these were “not charged again,” just shown again. Yet, £214.41 was deducted from my credit card — part of which they admit was £180.18 for Roadside Assistance, which I never intended to buy. That leaves £34.23 unexplained.

2️⃣ Misleading Upselling
Despite already having full insurance, I was pressured to buy Roadside Assistance at pickup. The staff explicitly told me it would not cost extra and was “included in the basic insurance.” This is clearly false and designed to exploit tourists unfamiliar with UK rental terms.

3️⃣ Admin Fees Without Proof
Charged £45 per “admin fee” for supposed fines or tolls — yet no evidence or notice was ever provided.

❗ Avoid Europcar. It will give you nothing but a deeply unpleasant experience. Nothing else.</div>

                <div class='text'>Forced premium insurance

Rented a car for a week in Birmingham at EuroPcar

Had a full insurance over booking.com and when I arrived at the place to pick up the car, the staff just told me that their system can't accept the insurance that I bought over booking.com

The staff then forced me to buy one of their premium insurances before they would give me the keys to the car while then getting in contact with a person. They knew who to call at booking.com to force the cancelation of my insurance from there. My original price when I booked the car was around 60 pounds which then was changed to 250 + 100 in deposit.

The choice I had were 250 gbp + 100 gbp in deposit for full insurance
150 gbp + 200 gbp in deposit for half insurance
and the most outrages one was 87 gbp + 700 gbp in deposit for only windshield insurance

Had to talk with the support 3 times and on the second time I called in toto hear about the deposit. The lady on the phone just said I should wait and placed me on a waiting line just to end the call.
I tried it once more after half an hour and spoke with someone who tried to help me.

And just for the icing on top , I get a a late notification about a parking ticket when I dropped of my partner.
It was sent extremely late.</div>

                <div class='text'>I rarely leave reviews, but my experience with Europcar was frustrating enough to warrant one.

First, when we arrived to collect our rental, we were expecting the MG ZS SUV we had booked months earlier. Instead, the woman at the desk tried to hand us a much smaller car — one that wouldn’t have fit our luggage. When we pointed this out, she suddenly offered us a van instead. We had to insist multiple times that we had paid for an SUV and expected what we reserved.

After “checking with the fleet manager” (twice), she miraculously located the exact vehicle we had booked — which had apparently been “unavailable” moments earlier. When we reached the car park, we saw at least half a dozen other MG ZS SUVs in plain sight, and another couple who had also just been given a van instead of the car they were promised.

Then came the handling of a parking fine administration fee. I had already successfully disputed the fine and notified Europcar with evidence before they charged my card. Despite this, they still took the £45 fee and made me chase them down multiple times — even rejecting a screenshot of the cancellation and demanding a PDF version of the exact same message. This is not how you treat a customer — especially one who proactively followed the rules and provided the relevant information in good faith.

If this is how Europcar handles both reservations and basic customer service, I’d strongly recommend choosing a different company.</div>

                <div class='text'>On my recent rental from Europcar in the UK I was invoiced and charged for an additional 2 days, they decided that I collected the vehicle 2 days before I actually did. My card was charged and it took over 3 weeks to return the funds to my account.
The same rental also attempted to charge me for pre-existing damage that was "100% not there before I rented the vehicle", despite the damage being indicated on the rental agreement, they finally dropped the case when I provided photos and videos of the vehicle and the damage whilst the vehicle was at the collection depot.
Do not trust Europcar, they will try and rob you and if you prove that they are in the wrong they will offer no more than an insincere apology for the inconvenience.</div>

                <div class='text'>Europcar have charged us 3 times instead of once for our booking. We paid on credit card and didn't realise until we got the bill which we are now obliged to pay to avoid interest charges so that is 100's of £. We reported this to Europcar 11 days ago and they are still "investigating" even though we sent them all the paper work highlighting their error straight away. VERY poor service all round.</div>

                <div class='text'>Picked up a car in Stansted airport London. After we picked up the car we talked about that the talk we had with the sales guy at the pickup reception ended up more as he needed to sell us an upgrade than listen to our needs .... and we ended up with a car we actually didn't need.

                <div class='text'>Picked up car from Italy - Rimini. Ordered a VW Tiguan, received a citreon of a completely different category (2 categories lower than what we ordered). Still not have received a refund for the difference.
Then returned the car within the permitted 29 minute grace period, the Europcar employee put on the Statement of Return that we returned the car 55 minutes late, completely false information and they have tried to charge us for an extra day - but we LUCKILY have the car parking ticket to prove this is wrong.

                <div class='text'>Refused to honour my booking from the airport for car rental for a week (after I had already rented a car for a month, returned only days before). The reason given was that I did not have a confirmed return flight. I did not have a confirmed flight because I had to cancel the flight when the family member I was travelling with was urgently admitted to hospital and I did not know when they would be discharged. I understand the basis for the policy but staff claimed that nobody had any discretion on how to apply it and there was nobody who could be contacted with any discretion. I’ve used them a fair bit in the past but I never will again, obviously thinks very little of the care for their customers.</div>

                <div class='text'>After our motability car breaking down we were given a hire car from europcar.
When it was dropped off it had all the usual checklists ticked on leaflets etc
It consequently broke down when we were on our way out..NO OIL IN CAR!
After waiting for recovery they told me the engine was cooking..and it needed oil asap..not to use...great 2nd car to breakdown! I then had to walk to the other side of town to BUY MY OWN OIL!!
Which was ridiculous.
The car was left at the new dealer fuelled up n clean..only for them to remove £69 out my bank without telling me what it was for..then they said oh we charged you wrong amount.. making me overdrwn. Countless phonecalls and a month later and I'm STILL waiting for compensation which I keep getting told 7 working days, 7 working days email only, another team are dealing with it WHATEVA!..totally fed up with the lot of them.
Disgusting customer service..would not recommend to my worse enemy
Having put a formal complaint in when my partner was having a suspected stroke at the time..still waiting...

                <div class='text'>Don’t go anywhere near them! Such a dodgy company.

Was forced into paying for the damage waiver in France as the operative simply would not stop badgering, knew I was in a rush and refused to give me the keys until I purchased the upgrade.

They tell you not to bother inspecting the car because you won’t be charged. THIS IS NOT TRUE. Dropping the car off there was a scratch on the paintwork which looked historic. Whilst I accept I should’ve checked and said something, I relied on what I was told that I didn’t need to check. I highlighted that the scratch looked historic and the operative at the other end even agreed. He told me to simply sign the form saying we’d spoken about it and not to worry as I wouldn’t be charged anyway as I had signed the damage waiver.

Well, I wake up to a £100 “damage admin fee” - so I was charged. With my invoice I had a link to press to complain, this sent me to a form that I completed. The response to that form was “you’ve contacted the wrong Europcar, you need to contact Europcar France not Europcar UK”.

The buck-passing began there. I asked repeatedly why I wasn’t allowed to rely on the representations made that I wouldn’t be charged both before I signed the contract and after and was told the T&C’s applied (which was in direct contradiction to what I was told). The response was only “you signed the form acknowledging the damage”. If I had known about the charge (and gone against what 2 members of staff said too my face), I wouldn’t have signed it.

Beware. Beware. Beware. They will hoodwink you, pressurise you and after all of that, still charge you. Hidden fees are their speciality it seems.

Will never touch Europcar again and I can only recommend you do the same.</div>

                <div class='text'>Don't expect them to answer the phone. They were supposed to be dropping off a car for us to collect from the dealer whilst our car is being repaired. They called us at 10.00 in the morning - it's now 17.45, the dealership closed 15 minutes ago & my wife has spent a frustrating hour trying to get hold of them.
We've finally got hold of them to be told that the car is at the (closed) dealers & the dealer have the keys. No contact from them to tell us it was on its way or had been delivered.
I'm in a meeting 20 miles up the road at 08.00 tomorrow - the dealer opens at 08.30.

Despite the fact I'd already paid online for the booking and had all the mandatory documents outlined in the confirmation email, the customer service reps from Europcar wouldn't let me pick up the car from Luton Airport because I didn't have a return flight booked (due to the fact I didn't yet know when my dad would die, when the funeral would take place, etc.). They cancelled my booking. I had to hire a car from another company at three times the price. I will never use Europcar again.</div>

                <div class='text'>Posting this as a warning to other customers of Europcar's Park Royal branch in North West London.

Having used this outfit twice, it appears that their usual practice is not to carry out any kind of pre-hire walk around with the customer. On the second of the two occasions I hired a car here, this lack of a pre-hire check was used in an attempt to make me pay for pre-existing damage to the wheel and tyre. The person I handed the car back to spotted this very minor blemish so quickly that I can only assume that they knew it was there and needed someone to pin it on.

However, while Europcar doesn't do pre-hire checks, I do and I had photos to prove that the damage was there when I collected the car. The person I handed the car over to couldn't have been less interested in this despite this being an opportunity to wrap things up there and then. He was clearly desperate to pass this up the chain, claiming that he would get in trouble if he didn't.

The matter was passed to Europcar's damage team, who are slow, incompetent and impertinent. After almost a month of exchanges, Europcar have gracelessly and grudgingly conceded that they were wrong and I've been informed that I will not be charged for damage that someone else caused.

I certainly won't be using this shady outfit again. If you do, I'd strongly advise you to take a comprehensive and clear photographs of every aspect of the car, interior as well as exterior photographs. Time stamp them if possible. If I hadn't done this I'd have been a few hundred pounds out of pocket.</div>

My daughter having flown from Australia where she works at the moment hired a car to pick up from Stanstead Airport, on arrival was told that she could not hire the vehicle as she didn’t have a return flight booked ! this was because she had come home as her father was in a hospice dying so no time scale available, despite being a British Citizen, having paid with credit card at home Uk address and hired from here before was still told no therefore stranding her at the airport .

                <div class='text'>I would like to give a review about my experience at Europcar by Birmingham airport today. The front desk employee named “Bryan” (black guy at desk) mistreated me and my uncle so badly today. I came to the branch desperate for a car as I broke down and I needed something for the morning to commute to work. The first thing Bryan told me and reassured me was dont worry we have enough cars for you today and showed me all the cars they had in the carpark. I felt a bit better because thats what I needed to hear. Once he found out that Im desperate for a car as I broken down and once he found out what do I do for work everything changed. So online it was showing they have availabity for an Audi A3 coming all together around £250 for 4 days (second driver included) I did not book it online as I was unsure if they accept debit or credit card. So I turned up to the branch, even then I needed my uncle to book as I am currently waiting for my debit card to come home so in this case he would pay , and I can transfer him the money and I can drive to work.
Let’s go back at the point when “Bryan” found out how desperate I was for a car. He only offered me a Fiat punto for first £389, (after I told my uncle to make way and come to the branch) then I asked him how come online it says I can get an audi for almost half the price he said no you cannot no you cannot without giving me an answer as I was confused. Fair enough he wanted me to pay double, my uncle asked a question so which other cars do you have and Bryan looked at him weird asking for translation as my uncle english is not perfect but he is a manager at a wholesale place I can assure he has a degree, who is Bryan to make joke of his english?. This completely made me think he was being racist to us. I then asked, ok so what if I book a car for 2 hours later as per online procedure and it was showing I can get an A3 for £250 for 4 days what would you do then if you saying you cannot give me that one as its gone? He did not bother giving me a proper answer and instead of helping me save money or finding a solution to my problem he decided to just say mate you can have the Fiat punto for £456 now or I’ll just tell you to walk out mate. What? So the price gone up for me asking few questions or my uncle asking a question?
THIS IS NOT HOW YOU TREAT A CUSTOMER IN NEED OF HELP, I DO NOT KNOW WHO GAVE TRAINING TO THIS GUY BUT PEOPLE AT DESKS ARE MEANT TO HELP CUSTOMER AND NOT CHARGE EXTRA EXTORTION PRICES. IM REALLY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS EXPERIENCE AS I WASTED ALMOST 3 HOURS OF MY TIME AND ALL I GOT IN RETURN WAS THIS GUY TRYING TO SHOW HIS POWER AND BE RACIST TO MY UNCLE PLUS STRESS TO FIND A CAR FOR MORNING. Really disappointed in you guys, because of Bryan I will have to catch a taxi early in the morning and back home. Meanwhile the other guy at the desk was the opposite, he went home at 7.30/8 pm but was willing to help his attitude was really nice I wish he stayed and dealt with my query. Also the guy bringing the cars was really kind too. Bryan Instead he could have decided to help me saying, mate book it for the morning or tomorrow online it might be cheaper or better cars etc….Is this how you treat customers in need of help?

                <div class='text'>I booked a car online with everything confirmed and paid in advance. At the counter, I clearly declined extra services and only requested prepaid fuel.

Despite that, I was later charged for an additional insurance I never agreed to, followed by another unexpected charge after returning the car — with no explanation or invoice. On top of this, my deposit was never refunded!!!

I contacted customer service multiple times via email. To this day, no one has responded.

Extremely poor experience, lack of transparency, and zero customer support. I cannot recommend this company.</div>

                <div class='text'>Be wary using this company.

I booked my car through Expedia. However, upon collection at London Heathrow the price was considerably higher. When I questioned this I was told it would be resolved when the car returned and final invoice produced. A week later I have been billed the overcharged amount and neither Expedia nor Europcar willing to sort it out. In fact Europcar wrote to me saying they would not honor the Expedia pricing.

Unethical and dishonest. Not a company I will be using again and I warn anyone booking to be wary too.</div>

Our experience with this company was deeply frustrating and disappointing from start to finish. The customer service is absolutely appalling — no one was willing to take responsibility or even attempt to resolve the issues we faced. Every time we reached out for help, we were either ignored or passed around with no real support.

We were also given completely incorrect information about petrol prices, which led to us paying far more than necessary for the journey we took. When we raised this, it was brushed off without any accountability.

To make matters worse, there was a problem with the car itself — and again, no one wanted to assist. We were left to deal with the situation on our own, with no guidance, apology, or even basic courtesy.

I strongly advise others to avoid this company. Do not hire from them. The service is unprofessional, unreliable, and not worth the hassle or the cost.</div>

                <div class='text'>The longest wait I have ever had for a hire car - it was inconceivable the amount of time they took to deal with people. Then there was a problem with my booking and we had to start again. They refused to allow me to use my own insurance. They were uncontactable after the hire to discuss a lost jacket. An absolute shower . . . And very expensive. They also misled me about there being no petrol stations nearby in order to encourage me to take their fuel pre- paying service.</div>

                <div class='text'>Your company/branch (Woodford Green, Essex, UK) is a total disgrace.

I was called only three minutes before I was due to collect a large van. James (Jimmy) explained that only a smaller wheelbase van was available but that I would be receiving £30 as compensation.

Months later and I still have not received the promised money. The manager was there and was extremely apologetic, but still hasn't bothered to keep to his word.

This branch is a mess and I'd give zero stars if I could! Honestly disgusted with how I've been treated and I hope you'll consider the above and look elsewhere; especially if you require a long wheelbase van.

                <div class='text'>I hired a vehicle from Europcar and had to top up the engine oil during the rental because the car was running low — not ideal, considering it should have been checked before hire. I contacted Europcar at the time and was told I would be reimbursed for the oil purchase.

I provided the receipt as requested, but since then I’ve been ignored. No refund, no reply, and no explanation, despite multiple follow-ups.

It’s not about the small amount of money — it’s the principle. If Europcar can’t follow through on a basic reimbursement they agreed to, I’d question how they handle more serious issues.

Disappointing experience. If you value accountability and clear communication, I’d think twice before booking with Europcar.</div>

                <div class='text'>Europcar Heathrow.
Arrived off a 32-hour flight from New Zealand. Tired and disorientated I arrived at the desk ready to produce my CarTrawler.com voucher for the 30-day rental. This was not required, apparently. I asked about an upgrade to a car with automatic transmission and was told that one was available at an additional 25 GBP per day. I was told by Danielle that because she was not (now) going to be charging me for the additional driver (upon the return of the vehicle) that additional cost would only ‘feel’ like 5 GBP per day as the additional driver would have otherwise been charged at 20 GBP per day. We signed the documents, drove away and then 30 minutes later realised we’d been well and truly conned by Danielle.

The cost of the additional driver, for the original vehicle or for the upgrade was NOT 20 GBP per day (or 600 GBP in total). It’s only 186 GBP for the whole period (according to their website) for the upgraded vehicle. I phoned Customer Services from a service station on the M5, who also said that the 186 was too cheap and it they’d never offer an additional driver for less that 13 GBP per day.

So, having already paid 1,034 GBP for the original vehicle I was stung for another 1,035 GBP for the upgrade. The payment was taken out of my bank account, and this prompted an email to their customer services. Several emails later, during which I was told that “You’ve signed the documents, so you had to pay”, and that “I (the customer service rep) was not there when you had the conversation with Danielle, so I can’t confirm or corroborate what was said and so can’t offer a refund for the difference” etc etc, it went on.

The upgrade vehicle, should I have booked that originally, would have cost me 1,390 +186 = 1,576. I was conned out of 492 GBP. I wasn’t asking for a refund for the whole amount, just this difference. I would have been happy to pay the correct price for the vehicle that I had.

The whole ‘show’ was a farce. “For this deal I need to get my manager to sign this off. It’s that good” (Danielle). The whole things was a well-practiced hustle.

This whole experience really played on my mind for the whole of my holiday in the UK. This experience and realisation of their wrongdoing was something I was unable to reconcile with.

Avoid, avoid, avoid. I hope my that by writing this I can help others to avoid a similar experience.

Total waste of time. No change in stance, just "Europcar UK have provided you with an explanation for the fee you raised. Based on the information available and the explanation from Europcar UK, we regret to inform you that the upgrade fee is valid and cannot be waived."</div>

                <div class='text'>Terrible experience. I booked and paid for an SUV just three hours before pickup, only to arrive and be offered an electric car I never requested. When I declined, I was rudely dismissed and then told the only option was a tiny Fiat 500 — completely unsuitable for a family.

Other customers were facing the same issue, including those who had booked weeks in advance. The staff were rude, unhelpful, and took a “tough luck” attitude with everyone. I was even told it was my fault for booking “too late” — despite their system accepting my payment and confirming availability.

The whole experience was chaotic, unprofessional, and completely ruined the start of our family holiday. I had to get a refund and find an alternative at the last minute. Easily the worst customer service I’ve ever experienced. Never again.</div>

                <div class='text'>Steer clear. There are enough car hire companies around to choose from. Hire car returned, and recieved a call, whilst on holiday, saying I owed money for a fine for a toll road. I knew it wasn't right, but I was bullied into paying it, as it was my ex partners card on the car and I did not need the hassle.
When I got home, I contacted the toll company, to find that there was an error and the fine had been quashed. I contacted Europcar and was told they would look into the refund.

Two weeks later, still no refund and no response to my formal complaint. They were quick enough to bully me into paying the fine, but not so quick to refund what they owe me.

Awful customer service, with absolutely no idea how to help me get a resolution, other than to say someone will be in touch within 5 days!

They then took out 2 identical payments of 83.34 from different branches and a further payment of 178 after I had complained and they had ensured that my case was being looked in to.

                <div class='text'>Car hire in itself was ok but at the checking in process the staff member tried to upgrade as we had booked flights through Ryan air. After several minutes of selling, the upgrade would have cost a ridiculous amount so we stuck with our original car. The real bug bear is that we verbally agreed to return the car with a full tank of petrol, which we refilled at Birchanger services next to Stansted. Expecting a refund of the fuel deposit we paid of £47.04 and after re fuelling at a further cost of £18.63 thus totalling £65.67. Did we receive the deposit back, No. We contacted Europcar who opened a case but sadly even though the vehicle showed we had refilled the car to the exact amount that was in the tank originally they would not refund the deposit. This seems to us to be extremely unfair. Be very wary.</div>

                <div class='text'>I rented a van from Europcar on the 13th of June and returned it the following day, the 14th. While I’ll admit their vehicles are quite lovely and modern, that’s about the only good thing I can say. The rest of the experience was a full-blown disaster.
I used the van to move boxes to my new house, driving a total of just 38 miles. However, when I went to refill the tank before returning it, I had to put in 14.61 litres of diesel. That’s laughably excessive. For context, I drive a diesel SUV 64 miles round-trip to work daily, and that uses only 4–5 litres. So how did 38 miles in a van burn through nearly triple that?
The answer is simple: the vehicle wasn’t filled up properly when I received it. The digital fuel gauge can be deceiving, giving the impression of a full tank even when it’s not. I mentioned this immediately upon return, only to be told that maybe the heavy boxes I moved caused it. A flimsy excuse at best.
I raised a formal complaint online on June 15th, expecting the promised "7 working day" resolution. It's now well past that, and I’ve received nothing but silence and disgraceful customer service. I've been hung up on twice after providing my complaint reference, and on one occasion, I was subjected to the rudest, most unhelpful call imaginable. Not once did anyone seem remotely interested in resolving the issue.
If you're thinking of using Europcar, don’t unless you’re prepared to be ignored, insulted, and treated like a nuisance the moment you raise a concern. Their complaint process is more like a black hole. Once you're in, expect no return.
Avoid Europcar. Their shiny cars hide a rusty, soulless machine underneath.</div>

                <div class='text'>**London Stansted - Be wary of upselling**

We’re the expat family with 2 kids and grandparents either side of the country. We need a rental with a big boot.

Europcar website has an MG model they state takes 3 cases. The only other cars they state this are their premium models.

When you select the MG model online, when you come to pick it up you will likely be told it’s not available but they can upgrade you to a premium model. They will offer you standard model car that even by their own website can only take 2 cases. Forcing you into the premium models.

By this point you are stuck. An online booking of £850 cost me £2,000 in increased insurance coverage (yeeeah they waived the upgrade fee). They are only interested in upselling anything they can to you.</div>

                <div class='text'>I will not be using Europcar ever again in the future. I had a car booked for 12 days in Crete all paid for in advance. Unfortunately our flight was delayed by 2 hours. This meant the office would be closed when we arrived at midnight. I phoned the local office to tell them I would be arriving late hoping they would stay open the extra 30 minutes. They told me that they wouldn’t stay open longer and if I don’t collect before they closed I would be a “no show” and I would lose my booking and all the pre paid money. I asked if i could collect the next morning, and was told no because they would have already cancelled the booking and put me down as now show. They suggested I call customer
Services, which would be great but that was closed at 4pm on Sunday. I tried to modify my booking online but that was just trying to charge me £300 more to have a booking 1 day shorter. To avoid the no show fee I had to cancel the booking online. WHY could I not just pick up the car a day later as I had already paid the full amount!! Side note noticed the hertz desk has stayed open late to meet the flight. After starting a customer complaint, Europcar informed me they re within their rights to not refund my deposit as I didn’t give 48 hours notice to cancel. This leads me to think they would have actually kept all my money and put me as a no “show “. Will not be using Europcar again and hope others learn from my experience.</div>

                <div class='text'>Absolutely APPALLING service. Motability car was booked over a week ago. I rang the day before car was due to be delivered to make sure booking was on schedule and was told yes. I then I get a message on the due date of delivery to say your booking has been received and we will call you 24hrs before car will be delivered. After numerous calls on the due day and over 2 hours hanging on the phone each call said no-one available please call back. AVOID AT ALL COSTS !!!!!</div>

                <div class='text'>Had a car booked and they had a note of my flight details. Received a call 5 hours before my flight to say the office will be closed when we arrive at Belfast International Airport. We were visiting Northern Ireland as our son was competing in the Open with a 7am tee off the next day. The member of staff who informed me of this was unapologetic and rude. She then informed me that I can collect the car the next morning. She also advised me that if I hired a car off another company would be about £2000. I had visions of us sleeping in the airport!! As it happened we managed to sort a plan B. We missed the first half of our son’s day 1 of his tournament. Will not use this company again.</div>

                <div class='text'>Don't bother booking with the Norwich Airport branch. I booked a car online paid for it and waited for it to arrive. When it didn't I rang the branch but you just cannot get hold of anyone. The phone just rings and rings! When a person did eventually answer she told me that the booking had been cancelled and that they had rung to tell me but I hadn't had any missed calls or had any messages left so she was lying however she tried to tell me that it was me that was lying! Are you freaking kidding me?? She was so unprofessional on the phone her tone of voice and the way she spoke to me was bang out of order she had a real bad attitude which was not called for! Before I could insist that noone had rung me she told me that I would receive a refund in about 2 weeks and then hung up on me. I tried ringing back but unsurprisingly noone answered! This business is a joke and I won't use them again. They have caused me so much stress in dealing with this. Never again! Wish I had read the reviews on here and TripAdvisor before going ahead and giving them my money!</div>

                <div class='text'>Europcar is a awful company.

Suddenly 9 months after the rental they send me a link to pay for my rental. No explanation just saying I did not pay. I have provided the invoice they issued when paid. Then they change the story saying they had a system error.
As a courtesy I send them a copy of my bank statement, showing the transaction but they not happy.
When tried to contact on the phone couple of times I got the message from other department they experience technical issues.
Of course they use all Legal threats etc you to make you feel scared and pay.
Such company's should be prosecuted for doing so.</div>

                <div class='text'>Awful experience. Booked through a third party website, the agent spent too long trying to get me to pay for an expensive upgrade which i refused but found out later that he had still charged me for an upgrade. The charges were confusing given I had booked and paid already and I made the mistake of trusting the integrity of Europcar staff. There were other extras added on that were never discussed. The agent then spent time trying to get me to give them a 10/10 review at the end of the rental. They get 0/10. The agent was nothing but a financially incentivized add on seller. First time meeting a snake oil salesman. Never again. The rental was actually expensive to start with and then was extortionate with the additional charges I was landed with.</div>

                <div class='text'>Awful experience, would never use again. They outright robbed me of 240 pounds. Car door was damaged upon pick up but strangely it wasnt already noted in the system when I returned the car. Got back home to Australia to find additional charge of 240 pounds on my card for additional products that I was supposedly offered at the desk. That is 100 per cent a lie. The assistant Ilias never offered me any extra products or services and I certainly never agreed to any. He must have ticked additional boxes on the paperwork without telling me. He kept me waiting for 10 minutes to serve me when there was no one else waiting. Waiting area was dirty . Have contacted the customer services team only to be told my request to a refund for their outright robbery has been refused. Would never ever hire a car from them again. Complete theft of 240 pounds.</div>

                <div class='text'>We went through the lengthy process of signing up, choosing to have the car delivered as we are staying on a campsite near Birmingham for our holiday.
Supplied all the relevant documents (drivers licence proof of address etc) and paid the fees. We got an email confirmation and all was good.
Then we got a call to say they cannot deliver to a campsite, no idea what difference that makes but nothing they could do. Sounds bizarre as Europcar surely have many holidaying customers who would love to use this service.

                <div class='text'>What went right is the real question...

Hired a van on the phone with a customer service agent who told me the van was available in the chosen location. After booking on the phone and paying for the van, i shortly (within 30 mins of booking) received a voice message call to say the van wasn't available.

I called in after waiting on 30 mins on hold to be told that they will cancel my booking. Having not received a fund and having sent 8 emails, called in multiple times to be placed on hold for 30 mins for them to hand up on 5 occaisions im still yet to receive a refund.

I then got an email to say i have been charged a no show fine on top of that... so im now further in with this. Continuing to make contact with no help from their customer service and emails still yet to be answered...

No resolution so far and i'm continuing to chase...</div>

                <div class='text'>I hired a car from Europcar for 10 days at a cost of £380. Almost immediately after booking, I realised I needed the car for 12 days instead. I phoned their call centre and was told not to amend the booking — just to call back once I had the car, and they’d add the extra 2 days at £38 per day. Sounds simple, right? It wasn’t.

Two days into the hire, I called to extend the booking by 2 days — exactly as instructed — and was told I’d have to pay £420. That’s more than the original £380 for 10 days, just for 2 more days! Even more outrageous, I checked online and the same car was available for £170 over the same 2-day period.

When I asked why, I was told the only option was to return the vehicle all the way back to Edinburgh Airport (a 140-mile round trip for me), start a new booking, and drive off again — all for something I was told could be handled over the phone for an additional £80 total.

I raised this as a complaint and was told to contact the Edinburgh depot directly. After 5 separate attempts and 5 hours on hold over 2 days, I gave up — which I suspect is exactly what they count on.

I went back to the main number and asked to speak with customer service, only to be told:
“It’s what the computer says — there’s nothing we can do.”

Absolutely disgraceful service, zero accountability, and pricing that borders on predatory.
BE AWARE before booking with Europcar.

I called customer service to arrange for a recovery van to come out to give me a new tyre but I was told sorry we don't come to the highlands you will have to arrange your own replacement.

I said too the person on the other end of the phone but I have full cover 24 hour cover is that not correct
I was told you do have that cover

So I said what's the problem

I was then told again we don't come up to the highlands

I said then you should not of sold me the policy as I told the girl at the Edinburgh airport

                <div class='text'>I was the victim of a very well practiced con trick by the desk staff at Faro airport. After I booked the car in the UK, I phoned Europcar and asked if they sold damage waiver Insurance (I normally buy it separately online). I was told that it wasn't necessary as all their cars were fully covered under the rental agreement. At the Faro desk, I agreed to pay for a vehicle upgrade, and they asked me for a large amount of deposit to cover damage. Realising that I did need damage waiver, I told them I was just going buy the damage waiver online for £42 for the 8 days i needed. The desk staff said they would sell it to me for £24, so I accepted. When my credit card bill came through, they had charged me £24 a day! They also charged me around an extra £50 to collect the car! I have phoned and written to complain, but they don't care. Of course they don't - it's their way of operating - deceitfuly. I'm really dissapointed, I thought they were a reputable company 😔</div>

                <div class='text'>Avoid Europcar Stansted at All Costs – Scam Artists!

I booked a car through Ryanair for €150, thinking I was getting a fair deal. Once I arrived at the Europcar desk at Stansted, the nightmare began.

They tried every trick in the book to confuse me and inflate the price – hidden fees, invented extras, unclear explanations. It felt like I was being hustled in a market stall, not a professional rental company.

In the end, I ended up paying three times the original price just to add a second driver and get full coverage – things that should have been clear and reasonably priced from the beginning.

This is not just bad service – it’s borderline fraud.
Run away from Europcar Stansted. Don’t fall into the same trap.</div>

                <div class='text'>I hired a car from Trieste Ronchi Airport on 22 June 2025, and returned it in Bologna on Thur. 26 June.

The pick up process went OK, but the car's conditions were worse than those described on the contract. This forced me to take something like 18 pictures of various damages and return to the office to report one of them in particular. This was particularly unpleasant as I had to do this under the scorching sun at about 37 degrees; it would be greatly appreciated if Europcar could rent some parking slots in the shade.

But the worst was still to come. The documentation I had been emailed when I booked contained 2 different addresses where to return the car in Bologna. When I asked about this on the pick-up day, the person behind the desk (Sig.ra Ilenia) said that, actually, both of these addresses were wrong, and gave me a third address ("V. Matteotti, 5 - Bologna"). She mentioned that, when I reached the car park, I should go to level -1. That was it.

On the last day, car return time was 15:00. Google map said it would take me 15 minutes to drive to the alleged return address (Via Matteotti, 5); I left at 1:45pm (1h 15min early).
Indeed, after less than 20 mins, I reached "via Matteotti"; however, when I started looking for no. 5, there was no “no. 5” anywhere. The numbering jumped from no. 1 to no. 7; in between, there was a huge bridge over the railway, and, after the bridge, Bologna's main Railway Station's car park.
The car park entrance had no indication suggesting that this might *also* be the place where rental cars had to be returned. There was NO Europcar sign to be seen anywhere, nor were there any other rental companies' signs, which would have hinted this could have been the correct location.

I stopped and called Europcar office in Bologna for some indications. It was about 2:10-15pm. Nobody answered. I tried several times, for about 5 minutes, but nobody picked up.

The clock was ticking. Given that I had 3 (three) different addresses where to return the car, and that, amongst those, one was Europcar's main offices', I decided to drive there, as the address placed it nearby.
After another 10 minutes, I managed to locate Europcar's office entrance, parked, and walked there.

It was 14:30, under a scorching sun (37 degrees C). When I got there, the office was closed. The sign on the door said "14:30" as the afternoon opening times. I waited for a few minutes, while occasionally ringing the bell, and insistently knocking on the office door.
No answer. Nobody was visible through the glass windows.
It was now past 14:35, the return time was approaching, and the door remained closed. I tried to call Europcar's office number again: no answer.
At that point I noticed a small sign (written in Italian) next to the office's door, stating that, should the office be closed, the car key should be dropped off at Europcar's car park located in the ** main train station's car park ***. It was now clear that Bologna's rail station car park was where Europcar also had its own car park.

But the calvary wasn't over. I drove the car to the train station car park, went to level -1 (where, finally, a "Europcar" sign showed up) and parked.
I had a look around, but there were no signs as to where to find the key drop box; there were no Europcar's desks anywhere. I walked to the top / ground floor, found a railways office, where a staff member of the national railways very kindly told me he believed the key box was on floor -1. He was not a Europcar staff, so he wasn't supposed to know this. I assume he knew as he had already come across tens of people who, like me, were looking for the same piece of information.
I then went back to level -1, where I found two other people equally lost and looking for the drop box: someone else had told them that it was at level -2, not -1. I decided to believe the railways staff member (for the reasons above) and we started walking around on level -1. Finally, in a very remote, dark corner of the car park, partly hidden by other cars, there it was, Europcar's key drop box.
It was now 2:55pm; I was drenched in sweat, and had spent 45' of my time doing this.

To sum up:
1. Europcar's office *never* answered any of my calls; I tried also later in the afternoon, repeatedly. This is simply a disgrace;
2. The documents I was sent contained 2 different addresses where to return the car, both incorrect;
3. Car conditions: some of the issues were not noted on the report I was given at car pick up;
4. When I picked up the car, Europcar staff (Sig.ra Ilenia) did not clarify that the return car park happen to coincide with Bologna's main train station car park;
5. Europcar's sign posting is abhorrent. A small sign next to the train station car park's entrance would have made this so much easier, as would some sign posting to the key drop box.

Overall, I will never hire a car with Europcar again.</div>

                <div class='text'>I recently hired a car from Europcar at Bergerac airport in France. As required, I returned the car undamaged, clean and full of petrol. Despite having three members of staff in the office, they just took the key from me without checking the car whilst I was there. Two days later they charged 222 euros to my credit card without any explanation as to why. I have subsequently contacted Europcar by phone and email (several times) but so far haven't received an explanation. Like many other reviewers I feel I've been conned. A terrible experience.</div>

                <div class='text'>Terrible policy - they charge if an emergency happens and you need to cancel your booking. Different tiers for bookings. Other companies offer free cancellation 24 hours and 2 hours before, which is standard, not with this lot. They're money-grabbing parasites. Smaller companies have better customer policies, so don't book with Europcar. I Recommend VIP Cars in the UK; they're great.</div>

                <div class='text'>Truly awful business.
If you book with Europcar expect a grossly inflated bill for the tiniest bit of wear and tear. They are nothing more than rip off merchants excessively profiteering with scandalous post handover practices. For example 500 euros for a tiny scuff mark that you can barely see. Good luck with challenging that when you get served with robotic AI written responses. Save yourself the hassle and book with someone/anyone else.</div>

                <div class='text'>Hi, it has been 3 weeks from 9th July, when the prepaid car was not given to me. I am still awaiting the refund for that amount. It is not only bad you did not give me the car, instead of compensating me for the inconvenience and higher costs imposed on me, I have to write to you 7 times by now to ask for a refund. What kind of customer service is this?

I had a prepaid confirmed booking for pick up yesterday from London Stansted on 9th July and drop off to Gatwick airport on 28th July. I had prepaid 585.47 GBP in advance for this booking.
I was not given the car by Europcar and neither given a refund.
They said the booking was done with a 3rd party and i need to talk to them. I have spent 4 hours yesterday and today and tried to speak to them and no resolution has been made till now. This is how you treat your customers?
I have made many bookings with you till now but I will not make any more if you do not refund this entire amount and compensate me for the inconvenience caused. I had to take an Uber to come to the city at a cost of 70 GBP and have spent many hours trying to find alternatives at the last minute that are far too expensive.
How will you compensate me for this?

1 more week has passed and I continue to try to reach to them to get a resolution but they really dont care at all. Never rent from Europcar. They are not interested in customers, only our money.</div>

                <div class='text'>I had Prebooked with a Carflexi Voucher from abroad but was denied rental when arriving at the (Heathrow) pickup desk due to Europcar's error. The worst part was that they couldn't contact their own internal department to correct the system because that department was closed for the long weekend.

I was left stranded and so had to go next door to Hertz and pay a large amount more for a 'walkup' rate hire (but was fortunate they had a car available.)
I have still not had my original pre-paid deposit refunded (but in fairness to Europcar, that would be by Carflexi - another issue).

A bit more explanation if needed - after hiring a car from Europcar the previous year, I received a notification from them that I had been issued an automated parking fine & associated Europcar admin fee (I don't have an issue with paying an admin fee for any legitimate infringement). However, I successfully challenged the parking ticket and Europcar confirmed they had rescinded the Admin Fee. Then I got a follow up letter from their Collecting-Agents / Solicitors chasing payment of the Admin Fee. Again, I sent the correspondence to them and again Europcar assured me this was rescinded and they had corrected it in their systems. They obviously couldn't be bothered to actually do that. When I arrived at Heathrow (after a long flight) they said they could not provide a car to me because I was on the 'watchlist' for this very same 'outstanding invoice'. I realized exactly what the issue was, but the department I needed to talk to was closed for the weekend. When they opened a few days later, they confirmed they were in error & I should not have been denied rental - but it was way too late by then.

Absolutely appalling systemic incompetence on Europcars part.</div>

                <div class='text'>Shame I can't give them zero stars! Hired a car through an agency prior to holiday in France. Picked up the car at Montpellier airport Europcar. Noted the damage and took extensive photos to ensure I was 'covered'. Returned the car 10 days later and, despite there being 3 persons in the Office (2 were just on their phones browsing the internet/on social media!), no-one wanted to inspect the car. I checked in at the airport and went through security. Just prior to boarding, when I had no chance to get back to the Office, I got a 'return invoice' detailing damage I had done to the car. I checked my photos and it was on both the before and after ones.....i.e. Pre-existing. Unfortunately, i was unable to dispute this at the time and rang Europcar customer service the next day to dispute this. I said I had photos, but they said they didn't need them at that time. However, 4 days later I get an e-mail saying that they were going to charge my credit card for the repair and they had attached the costs. There were no attachments! I immediately replied with the date/time stamped photos showing the pre-existing damage. 4 days later still no reply, other than the invoice for the repair! Europcar are obviously thinking "Here comes an old man, I wonder how much money we can get off of him?". Bunch of robbers! Never again!</div>

This is the third time they have done it and previously twice I had to call them after six weeks to get my money which was another headache. Poor Customer Service and very poor business service.. please award at all cost.
After second time I decided not to get anything from them but one of the colleagues insisted that they have improved now but doesn’t look like they are even worse.</div>

                <div class='text'>They’ve left me with a tyre that can blow-out at any moment!!!

Car was dropped off from their Leeds branch to York. On pickup the car had a lot of damage but that doesn’t matter as all noted - photos taken including the horrific alloy conditions. After having driven 250 miles, the next morning I check the vehicle over before setting off on a business trip and notice a huge chunk of rubber missing from the tyre. I check and the damage was there from drop off - you can literally see the tyre cords. I could have had a major tyre blowout on a motorway. I have now called Europcar 6 - 6!! Times in the space of 2 hours and STILL no resolution. If nothing gets resolved I am leaving the car at the hotel and will be claiming the taxi and railway costs from Europcar. I need to get back home and will not drive a car that has major sidewall damage. This will be going straight to the ombudsman due to the utterly unsafe condition they have supplied this car in.</div>

                <div class='text'>We arranged to pick up a hire car at Alghero Airport in Sardinia for a five day hire period. All was going well and a set of keys were set out for us. This was UNTIL the rep realised we had purchased fully comprehensive insurance and that both husband and wife would be driving. The key was swiftly removed from us and we were handed keys to a Dacia Sandero. All I can say is that this car looked like it had been owned by a succession of learner drivers. There were scratches and dents everywhere and the car wasnt particularly clean inside. The tyres were barely legal and in a bad state for the dusty roads. Total deception on our side as we paid over £500 for this experience (and were parked next to the shiny new Peugeot we were meant to be picking up). Will not ever use this company again and will be watching the credit card carefully now following other reviews.</div>

Unfortunately, I got my flight times mixed up and was late collecting the car. I didn't think it'd be a problem, as I'd already paid for it. BUT if you are more than 1 hour late you forfeit your booking with no refund! (should have read all the small print) Being stuck with no car, kids and a three week holiday in front of me, I had to hire another car and pay a much higher additional cost—complete nightmare and very expensive.

                <div class='text'>I was told it's now IMPOSSIBLE to book a small car from Glasgow, unless you pay extra. I'm a Europcar regular - I'm looking at my online record and I see ten rentals in the last two and a bit years. These are private retals, spanning Portgal, France, Germany, Spain and the UK.
I booked a Compact car ('Cupra Leon or similar' - that's a small hatchback. As on my last trip to Scotland, I was instead given a dreadful, wallowy, absolutely huge MG SUV. I asked for a smaller car at the desk, and was told I could have a BMW 1 series - for an extra £30 a day. I was told it's not possible to get the car I asked for without going premium - instead I had to put up with a bloated, rubbishy Chinese SUV.
To make things worse, the car stank of cigarettes - some previous user had been smoking in it. I complained before I drove away, and it was recorded (so I wouldn't have to pay for the damage - probably impossible to clean effectively) but I wasn't offered a change of vehicle.
Still, at least there wasn't a queue. On two receent trips - to Toulouse in France in June, and to Portugal in April - I had to queue for more than an hour to collect the keys. There's no 'Privilege' desk any more for regular customers - no reward for customer loyalty, for filling out details in advance to speed things up. No, you queue with all the people who need every last comma on the contract explained to them, while staff try their hardest to up-sell. EVERY. STUPID. TIME.
Anyway I'm getting utterly fed up with Europcar, I noted that queues at some other rental places are much shorter. I don't know if Hertz or Avis have a functioning loyalty programme but I might give them a try.
I moved to the Europcar app after using brokers for years, after two unforunate experiences (with Greenmotion in Edinburgh, and Goldcar in Italy - the latter now ironically a Europcar brand) where I was ripped off for non-existent damage I didn't do. I have a global excess policy that I use everywhere from the US to Taiwan and Japan, as well as across Europe. But these two were the only times it's been triggered. To be fair, Europcar haven't ripped me off in this way. It's a credible brand. But customer service has not recovered from COVID and it seems it may well be time to move on.</div>

So they charge me for 1 extra day, which is fair enough but what they didn’t tell at all until I confronted them about the extra 700 miles in charges! My booking was 6 days/ 1500 ml. This is 250 ml a day. Because I went over a few hours they change the mileage allowance to 90 per day which meant I was over 700 mos. Very deceiving. Never again I will hire from them. Also Bristol south not very nice people. In the end they charge me an extra 144£ for bringing the van a day later. Completely out of order!</div>

                <div class='text'>I have only given them 1 star because I cannot give nil. The most useless bunch of incompetents in the world. Do not use them! Was given a hire car by them whilst mine was in for repair. Told to call them to arrange collection when finished with to arrange collection. Can only call central number who could not organise collection every time they tried to put me through to the local depot I was sent back in a circle to the incompetents on the central line. Eventually after an hour calling these buffoons I gave up and called my insurance company direct. Do not use these if you value your sanity. A central number is no good if they can’t do anything and transfer you to someone who can! Br told they will put it in your notes repeatedly is no use- I just want it downhired and collected!</div>

                <div class='text'>Worst company ever. Customer service is a waste of time.they all need retraining in customer service, we had a car from europcar through motability. Took the car back to the dealership when I picked my own car up at 10.30am. Took europcar four weeks to txt me to say their was damage to the left passenger door, no damage when I returned the car , opened a dispute .no communication whatsoever, then recieves a letter saying damage was caused at 1.15 pm how they knew the time the damage was caused is beyond me , I returned the car at 10.30 yet the damage was caused at 1.15? They couldn't answer my question as to how do they know the time the damage was supposed to have taken place, still in a dispute .until they can prove i caused the damage when I didn't even have the car .

On what planet does it cost an extra £208 to hire a car dwarfing the original cost.

                <div class='text'>Never again! The worst car rental company. Do not book with them!
I just spent 3.5 hours travelling to Europcar Croydon just to find out that I cannot pick up my car as I needed to get an address check. This was neither mentioned nor highlighted to me when I booked the car. I haven’t only wasted a lot of time today I have also wasted money travelling to and back from Europcar. When I asked Shantee, Europcar Croydon’s customer service advisor whether I can provide address proof now or whether there is anything we can do so I can pick up the car that I booked a long time ago, he was not willing to help in any way.
I am left with the cost and no car. Very disappointing. I will never book with Europcar again.</div>

                <div class='text'>Having a car booked for 6 pm today, I received several confirmation e-mails, 3 only today, to get there and have the car rental denied was heartbreaking.
I rented with the company before and had no issues, all very smoothly. Also had rented another time and, with plenty of notice, had the reservation cancelled (which is fine), but having received several confirmation e-mails throughout the day to get there and having no explanation why I had no car waiting for me is less than human. I have lost my hotel reservation, deposit, and exhibition.
Worse is, I've gone around King's Cross to the other rental companies (including the same one, just a different branch), they all ran background checks, said it was all ok, but either had no cars or only £1k+/day cars.
There is no way of knowing whether you will get a car or not with Europcar, a company that is not very trustworthy.
What my trip was about shouldn't matter for the episode, but it's extra sad that it was a birthday present that got completely ruined, as there's no way of getting where we planned on going.</div>

                <div class='text'>I have worked with Europcar representatives for over 27 years, I generally hire from other outlets but decided to go with them. Booked a Nissan Quashqai size vehicle in advanced and presumed it would be, My wife and I arrived at Peterborough Europcar premises, completed the paperwork and then was given a smaller Jeep Avenger. The young person, told me thats all he has got and gave us £10.00 off (big deal), the vehicle was dirty on the inside, damaged rear bumper, scuffed wheels to name a few. Had the vehicle from 25th June until 3rd July 2025.</div>

                <div class='text'>My experience with Europcar has been extremely frustrating. I picked up the car at Edinburgh Airport, and the price we agreed on at the desk was not respected. I was charged significantly more than what was originally confirmed, including extra fees and taxes that were never mentioned in advance.
I’ve sent several emails to their customer service and haven’t received any reply at all. The lack of communication and support is unacceptable.
Overall, this experience has been really disappointing. I will definitely not use Europcar again, and I cannot recommend this company to anyone. There are other rental services that are at least transparent and reliable.</div>

                <div class='text'>My flight was diverted to Toulouse, my booked hire car was in Carcassonne Obviously stressed, as any passenger would be in the circumstance, I arranged an alternative at Toulouse. The office there oversold and, because I was so stressed, I wasn't thinking at the time and I signed the contracted. Later, I realised that the excess insurance which I had been told was included was an added extra (cover I didn't need) and I also realised that I should have been offered a one-way hire for one day, rather than being given a cancellation of my week's hire at Carcassonne and a new hire one-way hire from Toulouse for the week at a cost of some €600 more.

                <div class='text'>I rented a car from Europcar Gatwick in February 2025. When making the booking I added full insurance through the booking agent Discover cars and the supplier being keddy (AKA Europcar).
At the desk the lady verbally said she could see I had insurance so all was good, I paid the deposit.
It wasn’t until I looked at the invoice at home and saw a charge for premium insurance which had been added on top of the full cover insurance I had already purchased online. The premium insurance added was for £274. I immediately phoned Europcar, they told me they couldn’t do anything til after the car had been returned. So I emailed them once I had returned the car and keys to the out of office box.
This was in February. I have formally complained 3? times now. And nothing. I left a review on Google and Europcar just sent me the link to complain, the same link I’ve used several times already with no response.
I’ve seen lots of other Google reviews where people have been in the same situation as me. They just seem like an absolute scam of a company. And then actually ignore you when you try and pull them up on it. AVOID EUROPCAR.</div>

                <div class='text'>I book around 8 car hires a year for personal use. I decided given the loyalty program on offer I would pay slightly more to book all car rentals through europcar given the quality of their cars. Over a 18 month period I spent the equivalent of 1994 euros + local charges. This should have given me 2545 points. On taking out the loyalty scheme I was promised that all rentals in the last 2 years would count. In the last 2 months europcar have launched a new scheme and wiped all history of my points now starting afresh! I have formally complained and been told that I will receive no carry over of points. This is an absolute disgrace. I will not be booking anymore europcar in the future. All it would have taken was some common sense to credit me the old points in the new scheme</div>

                <div class='text'>I had some problems with the car I was given. After several hours trying to get the issue resolved, I decided to make a formal complaint by phone. This was ignored. I made another two complaints in writing, also ignored. I then sent a notice before action so I can take them to small claims court. I had a response saying they'd investigate, but of course I heard nothing afterwards. I don't want to go to court, but I've given them plenty of opportunity to resolve my problems.</div>

                <div class='text'>Absolutely appalling experience with Europcar Newtown branch. After reporting my car fault on Monday (window stuck fully down and eventually falling inside the door, leaving the car completely open to theft and rain), I was promised a courtesy car. They finally arranged one for Saturday at 11:30 am.

I waited around, but nobody ever showed up. I tried calling the branch repeatedly all week and again on Saturday—phone just rings out every time, no answer, no call back, nothing. In the end, no courtesy car and not even the basic courtesy of a phone call to say they wouldn’t come.

Truly shocking level of customer service. I’ve never experienced anything quite like it. The Newtown branch clearly can’t cope and really needs shutting down. Avoid at all costs!</div>

                <div class='text'>Collecting from Stanstead Airport on Thursday 26 June.
Only two reception staff and about 10 people waiting to pick up cars.
Took over an hour to get the keys. Since every car had been pre booked the company knew exactly how busy they would be and yet made no effort to staff up.
It says exactly what the management think of their clients.
Also a new , lubricious rule that you have to peovide your incoming flight number (seriously) as well as your departing flight. Why could that possibly matter?</div>

                <div class='text'>Despite successfully completing the online pre-checkin, I arrived at Bristol airport to be told that my address was not on their database and ‘computer says no’: I could not have a car. I gave two previous addresses but still ‘no’. I asked the desk clerk to phone her IT support team but ‘no - we can’t do that’. I asked to speak to the manager who was rude, surly and, after making no effort to resolve their issue with my booking or to provide me with a cancellation invoice to prove I had turned up, he dismissed me and returned to poking his computer. Email complaints to the customer service desk received fairly cursory, unhelpful replies. I never received an explanation- beyond ‘human error’ or any acceptance that their system was at fault. The desk staff have no ability to resolve issues. I luckily managed to get a car from SIXT at a similar price. NEVER BOOK WITH EUROPCAR - if something goes wrong, you are on your own.</div>

                <div class='text'>WORST HIRE EXPERIENCE – NEVER AGAIN

Absolute shambles of a company. Took nearly £500 from me for a van hire, I returned it in perfect condition with a full tank (after spending £200 on fuel), signed off at the depot with no issues… and then out of nowhere, they try and slap me with a random charge for “extra mileage.”

Funny how this supposed charge wasn’t mentioned when I handed the van back. Not a word at the time, but suddenly they’ve got the confidence to send robotic emails quoting “terms and conditions” after the fact, like that justifies daylight robbery.

You’re a multimillion-pound company chasing people for £60 like desperate vultures. No integrity. No transparency. Just jobsworth tactics and automated nonsense.

Avoid Europcar unless you enjoy surprise charges, smug copy-paste replies, and having to argue over scraps after already paying through the nose. Total disgrace.</div>

                <div class='text'>Terrible Experience – Hidden Fees and Misleading Practices

I strongly advise against renting a car from Europcar. Our experience was extremely disappointing and felt intentionally misleading. Upon arrival, we were pressured into renting a larger car than we originally booked, with the agent quoting us a price that did not include VAT—a detail they conveniently failed to mention until after we agreed.

To make matters worse, we were charged an unexpected Station Fee that was never disclosed on the website or in our confirmation email. These hidden costs added up quickly and left us feeling scammed.

This kind of lack of transparency is unacceptable. We will not be using Europcar again and suggest others avoid them to save time, money, and frustration.</div>

                <div class='text'>Terrible experience at Europcar Sheffield – misleading and time-wasting

I booked a car online through Europcar at an average daily rate of £15. When I arrived at the Sheffield branch to collect the vehicle, I was told that the car I reserved was not available. Instead, they offered a Tesla and demanded an extra £30 per day for the upgrade during my 9-day rental.

When I declined, they offered another vehicle for an additional £12 per day. Again, I refused, and they then claimed that no other vehicles were available and that I would need to wait 3–4 hours for a car to be returned.

I had taken time off work and planned everything around this rental. After insisting firmly, they eventually gave me a car they had on-site — clearly proving that vehicles were available all along.

This company is clearly trying to upsell and exploit customers instead of honoring bookings. I had many options when booking, and I deeply regret choosing Europcar. They wasted over an hour of my time and caused unnecessary stress.

If the agreed vehicle is not available, you are supposed to upgrade the customer at no extra cost — not try to profit from the situation. This is unacceptable.

Avoid Europcar, especially the Sheffield branch.</div>

                <div class='text'>Very disappointed with the service from the Maidstone branch. A hire car was due to be delivered to my 76-year-old mother at 9:00 AM. At 9:20, we received a call saying it would be delayed by an hour. When we asked for clarity or if the time could be improved, we were met with hostility and completely unhelpful customer service.

We were given contradictory excuses—first that they couldn’t reach the driver, then that the driver hadn’t even arrived at the office (despite the drive itself taking an hour). None of it made sense, and it was clear the car was never going to arrive on time.

The most frustrating part was the lack of honesty and the rude attitude. Eventually, the car was cancelled without informing us—we only found out through our insurance.

Extremely poor communication, no accountability, and unnecessarily stressful—especially for an elderly customer. We would never choose to use this company again given the choice.</div>

                <div class='text'>We rented a car for our holiday in lake Garda .
And what a an unsafe shit show it was .
Firstly they tried to charge us more for our insurance cover and more for the child seat that we had all ready paid for.
Then the Q5 that we had originally thought we was getting was a beat up old Citroen which didn’t barely have room for our 2 suit cases and the boot flung open on the motorway where the bags were crammed in and they had the cheek to try and charge us more insurance on this car and more for the child seat !
Then when we got the car this is the whopper the child seat that we had booked and paid for for our 2 and half year old they brought out a car seat for a rear facing new born baby. When we alerted the staff they brought out a booster seat for a 4 year old plus and before we could raise concerns the man literally ran off and we had to leave the car park due to other cars trying to leave and blocking up the car park.Them they said you agreed to pay the extra insurance which was flung on us at a busy desk with a queue of people in a foreign country!
So for our holiday for 8 days we had to drive with our daughter in a seat belt which is completely illegal and unsafe and restate the work unsafe !
Due to this we didn’t drive 80 % of the holiday which we had planned to .
And still when I rang up customer service about all this when home they just brushed off the safety of our child as we have no evidence of the car seat and there is nothing we could do…. Surely they had the 2 car seats in there depot so surely that would be evidence enough.
The fact that we paid money to Europacar pre booked our child seat and car and they didn’t have the safety equipment of the car seat to keep our child safe is outrageous.
And then to be told we can not do anything about this is a sneaky and unsafe way to do business.
I would like to see if I rented a car and child seat for one of their children and rush them out of the car park and see how they would feel.
I would never use Europacar ever again unsafe unprofessional and sneaky aswell in the end .
Take your money and provide an unsafe service disgusting.</div>

                <div class='text'>This company has a history of being fraudulent but i thought it was reputable....until i used them.
Similar to so many reviews i was inundated and pressured on arrival to upgrade every aspect of my booking.
I didn't as i had selected my chosen option prior to booking as 99% of us do so why annoy us so much on arrival.
The car had damage but was functional for the purpose of our trip.
We returned the car and left the keys in the cabin as there was no staff so we assumed that was it.
I complained about an invoice for £100 which i thought had been charged for alleged damage. I complained and said that i didn't and couldn't have caused the damage.....and that the damage shown would cost £5 to polish out.
It transpired that they wanted £450 for the alleged damaged and even referred me to a debt collector so i then owed over £500.
I eventually paid but intend to take legal action independently and will no doubt gain support once up and running.
Avoid at all costs this company will defraud you however way they can. Their business model is to sell low but looks to upsale or defraud.
It is an absolute scam and i cannot believe they are still in business.</div>

                <div class='text'>I strongly urge others not to use Europcar. My experience was nothing short of a rip-off. After returning a rental vehicle in good condition and signing what I believed was a routine check-in form, I was later hit with a staggering £714 charge for a tiny scratch.

There was no transparency about how this figure was calculated, no prior notification before the charge was applied, and no opportunity for a fair dispute. I formally raised concerns with customer service (Case #23359929), but the response was robotic and dismissive – no explanation, no breakdown of costs, and no engagement with the clear disparity between the "damage" and the fee.

The process feels deliberately opaque, and the customer support offered no real dialogue or justification for such an extortionate charge.

Warning to all renters:

Do not sign anything when returning the vehicle unless damage is properly reviewed with you on-site.

Document everything with photos.

Be aware Europcar may charge you excessively and without transparency.

This kind of behavior from a major rental company is unacceptable and exploitative. I am sharing my experience to prevent others from going through the same.</div>

                <div class='text'>This was my first time hiring a car, and I am so frustrated with my experience with them. They gave me a car that had a screw in the tyre. Without going into all the details here, they basically accused me of lying. I wrote many emails of complaint but they still charged me £195 for a tyre. I had taken insurance with a different company because it was cheaper but honestly I have never known any company to have such little regard towards their customers. From start to finish with company, I would go as far to say that they are the worst company of any company I have ever experienced.
The dashboard said there was a low tyre as I was leaving the depot, so I had a quick look and judged that none looked low to the eye, and just thought I’d keep an eye on it and pump it up myself to get it to the correct level. According to them, I should have checked all the tyres for screws and nails before leaving. Are you serious? I drove home and left it on the drive over night. In the morning it was nearly completely flat. I drove to a petrol station to pump it up noticed a screw in the tyre. I called them and was told to take it back to the depot. I did this, and I was told to take to Kwik Fit. I was also told it would be free as it wasn’t my fault. The apparently have no recollection of this. Their customer service have been terribly rude, and condescending, and any emails I have sent have not been personable in any way. No apology for my bad experience due to their incompetencies.</div>

                <div class='text'>Booked a car with europcar at Edinburgh airport on arrival they took my license & then advised I could not hire a car off them , couldn’t advise me to why I had been declined ,the booking was carried out as usual on the europcar app, I had booked several bookings this year & last year through the app , I found this quite astounding that they could decline with no reason , I called the DVLA Swansea & checked with them if anything was on my license that would decline this & the answer was none, I then noticed then that my middle name was missing a letter & I think this could be the only issue that could show up which is quite petty
Will never use europcar again & all the rest of our colleagues will be told the same
And to take this to an insult they tried taking £102 from my bank today
There were many Events on at the time & I believe they off loaded me to facilitate over bookings that they had booked
I am now awaiting for a response from europcar in this matter before I take legal proceedings to recover the costs that it cost me to take out another hire from another company which was an excessive charge</div>

                <div class='text'>I went to Europcar at Stansted on Sunday 22/06/2025 @ 19:30. I made the booking directly on Europcar website and I made the full payment ahead of the collection.

The person at the counter said my booking was rejected due to "policy reviews" preventing them from renting to locals. That was the only explanation and he didn't provide any alternative. This was a booking for a company for a professional meeting.

This is the worst experience ever. I completely advise against using EuropCar and I will never use it again.</div>

                <div class='text'>The staff here are friendly and helpful. The car requested was available, clean, and fit for purpose. The one star relates to administration and customer services. In a nutshell, they are claiming that I never paid a deposit so won't get the £250 that I did pay back. I paid a deposit and I can prove that; after all, who can hire a car without having to pay a deposit? What worries me is the stress and hassle for me in getting it back, and the convenience for and monetary interest earned by them. It's quite simply wrong.
EDIT : As of 9 July and following more emails from me STILL NOTHING! Small claims court, here I come.</div>

It is standard industry practice to provide an upgraded alternative if the class of car ordered is not available and this was not done. As a result I was left having to pay for an expensive taxi.

                <div class='text'>I was surprised to find so many negative reviews for Europcar as until recently I had used them several times and thought their service was good.
Sadly my last experience has shown me what their are really like. I inadvertently drove into an area in London that is no longer accessible to non-residents, unless you’re a guest. No longer living in London I didn’t know this and received a penalty notice.
I was surprised to receive it from Europcar week after my car was returned, but on realising it was my mistake I paid the notice and informed Europcar it had been settled. My complaint was that having paid the £65 fine promptly and thinking that was the end of the matter. Europcar then deducted another £45!! from my credit card to pay for their admin. I wrote to their customer services dept in case it was a mistake, as all they had to do was look up who was driving the car in question and send on an email informing them of the fine.
It would taken them 5-10 mins of their time to carry this out and for that they thought it was fair to charge £45 - which works out at an hourly rate of around £250-300p.h.
When I pointed this out the customer services department were obstructive and extremely rude, repeating the same comment that’s it’s in the t&c’s I had signed on hiring the car.
I tried to appeal against their argument but I kept receiving replies from the same 2 people who wouldn’t even listen to my point.
I understand that they need to make a charge for admin but £45 - on top of a £65 penalty notice is really extreme.
But it’s their poor customer service and the way my complaint was dealt with …or should I say ignored, that means they have lost yet another previously loyal customer. I need to hire a car every 4-6 weeks so they have lost my custom along with a lot of other people from what I am now reading.
Such a shame they are so short-sighted. Maybe the chiefs don’t know what the Indians are doing but if not then they deserve the criticism for not following the reviews on here.</div>

                <div class='text'>We rented a car in Faro over three months ago and were required to pay a €300 deposit, which we promptly provided. When returning the vehicle at Europcar Praia da Rocha (Portimão), the company attempted to charge us an additional €167 for "an extra day," despite returning the car on the agreed date. We were informed that our deposit would be refunded within 10 days. However, after this period elapsed, the deposit had not been received.

We contacted customer service, but their responses were unhelpful; representatives repeatedly disconnected our calls and were unable to provide clear information. Eventually, we were advised that the refund would take up to 28 days due to international processing times. Despite this, the deposit has still not been credited back to our account.

We have since liaised extensively with our bank and Europcar, but the issue remains unresolved. Customer service has been unhelpful throughout, and the situation is currently under investigation. We advise others to exercise caution when dealing with this company.</div>

                <div class='text'>Utterly shocking. Paid upfront for car hire, then paid for a taxi to go pick it up. Arrived … only to find that they “didn’t have a car after all”. (No car for hire at all, not just the car I had paid for). They are unable to give an immediate refund, for payment which was instantly taken for a service they cannot provide. Hundreds of pounds. It “might” take 10 days to receive a refund, could be longer, no one knows. Phone lines are not answered. In the meantime how can a person then afford to go hire another car? Made enquiries at their other office in the city, before realising they were not about to refund me, and they offered the same car type for twice the price. Walked the miles to the other depot, to find a damaged car which they would have been unable to hire to me anyway as the damage was so bad. Awful. Am needing to seek legal counsel to recoup money. I never write reviews, but this needs to be noted. This is the Stoke on Trent branches.</div>

                <div class='text'>I booked a car with Europcar UK and successfully applied a discount coupon — I even have a screenshot showing the discount clearly applied and reflected in the final booking price.

Shockingly, upon returning the vehicle, the discount was quietly deducted from my deposit with no warning, no explanation, and in complete contradiction to what was shown at checkout.

I reached out to customer service with full evidence (including a timestamped screenshot), only to be told “no coupon was applied” — a flat denial despite clear proof. Since then, I’ve sent follow-up emails and received no response whatsoever.

As a customer recently made redundant, I find this treatment not only financially unjust, but in breach of basic consumer rights.

I am now escalating the matter to Trading Standards, the Financial Ombudsman, and leaving this review to warn others.

It’s outrageous for a large company to behave in such a dismissive and unethical manner. If you apply a discount with Europcar, they will just remove it. Avoid at all costs this company!!</div>

Have spent a day wasted waiting for them to collect - despite having a text message at 09:30 to say they were on their way way.
Spent hours waiting on the phone - only for them not to answer.
Got a phone call at 15:23 to say they were nearly here and then a text message at 16:01 to say they were on their way 🤷‍♂️

                <div class='text'>On picking up my car it had 2 minor scrathes on a plastic wheel trim. On returning the car they have charged me £240 for 2 alloy wheel repairs. Their own charges schedule says that a broken or damaged wheel trim is £45, and the exact trim is £30 from Citroen. The guy tried to stop me taking of the wheel trim and taking a photo of it. I have submitted said photo and demanded a refund but they do not get back to me. On top of this he said that if I didn't sign his device I would lose my £500 blocked deposit.</div>

                <div class='text'>Since the beginning of the rental, I have faced several problems with the vehicle. After going to the city of Porto (about half-an-hour from the airport) and parking the car, I realized that the doors did not lock with the remote control and that the car would not start. I contacted their helpline and was told that the vehicle would be towed and a taxi would be sent to take me to another Europcar counter.

About an hour later, I arrived at the counter on Rua Gonçalo Cristóvão, where I had to wait another hour to be served due to the high number of people. I requested priority service, since the problem was Europcar's responsibility, but I was treated with indifference and a lack of professionalism by an employee, whose response was that I would have to wait the necessary time and that it was not her who caused the problem. I consider this attitude unacceptable and completely disrespectful.

After finally delivering a second car to me, I continued on my journey. However, when I arrived at my destination, I realized, to my surprise, that the remote control of this new car did not lock the doors either. I was again forced to return to the same counter, where, after another wait, I was provided with a third car, without any apology.

Since I picked up the first vehicle at 8:30 am, I spent about four hours without access to a working car, which means that I spent that time without enjoying the service I had already paid for. This lost time compromised important commitments that I had scheduled, namely a trip to the Citizens' Shop, which caused even more delays and inconvenience in the following days. All of this was made worse by the fact that I had been awake since 2am, having arrived in Porto at 7:30am on a flight.

I have filed a claim 4 weeks ago and have received no reply yet. Very unprofessional</div>

                <div class='text'>I wish to provide a candid warning to those contemplating the prospect of hiring from this company, particularly with regard to their Heathrow branch. This caution is underscored by a significant volume of negative reviews available online, and my experience is not isolated.

During my interaction with the Heathrow location, I was subjected to charges exceeding £200, categorised as a Premium Station surcharge. This fee is levied despite the availability of other provincial alternatives within a reasonable taxi or cab fare of approximately £20. Furthermore, I was charged for Super Premium Personal Accident Cover, which is redundant as I possess my own comprehensive annual coverage with premiums totalling less than the cost of their two-week charge. Additionally, their breakdown cover was almost twice the cost of a standard RAC or AA annual policy for annual duration.

Regrettably, I discovered these exorbitant charges only upon receipt of my invoice, as none of these fees were disclosed to me in advance. I strongly advise prospective customers to explore numerous online options for car hire excess cover provided by various insurers, which are available at a fraction of the costs imposed by this company. It is prudent to exercise caution; these charges are often hidden until after the transaction.

My attempts to rectify the situation were met with a lack of accountability. I engaged with a representative named Monica at a Spanish call centre, who assured me that the matter would be investigated. However, after a five-day interval, I was informed that no action had been taken, and I was told that Monica would face internal disciplinary measures.

Although a decision was made to refund my charges, I was subsequently informed that the process would take five days due to the sum exceeding their operational limits, necessitating approval from the UK. This was further compounded by a call handler abruptly ending our conversation when I sought clarification, stating that they were restricted in the length of calls. Once approval was secured, I was told that an additional ten days would be required for the funds to reach my account.

This level of indifference displayed by their representatives is striking, particularly in light of how they would likely respond if the roles were reversed and they were in a similar predicament. My experience has been distressing, exacerbating my PTSD with multiple triggers stemming from their deceptive practices.

I encourage anyone who has previously rented from this company to reassess their charges. Even years later, with the appropriate documentation, claims may be pursued in the County Court. To summarise:

1. Avoid utilising the Heathrow location.
2. Scrutinise all charges, regardless of the duration of your rental.
3. Research supplementary services available from various providers online.
4. Review competitor options thoroughly, paying particular attention to customer feedback.

Protect yourself and make informed decisions.</div>

                <div class='text'>We rented a car from Europcar Manchester via Expedia. As older French customers with limited English, we signed the rental agreement believing we were simply confirming the vehicle pick-up.

However, Europcar added extra paid services (premium insurance and roadside assistance) without clearly explaining them, even though we had already purchased full insurance coverage via Expedia.

Despite our complaints, Europcar refused any refund, relying solely on our signature and ignoring the language barrier and the context in which it was signed.

This was a very disappointing experience and, in our view, a clear abuse of vulnerability. We strongly advise non-English speakers or older travellers to avoid Europcar unless all documents are clearly translated and explained.</div>

                <div class='text'>Diabolical service - Lincoln branch, terrible service!
Booked a car with Europcar a few days ago to travel to Wales for a funeral. Paid for it online, did the online check in with licence etc all accepted and they took the money. Paid on a credit card.
Went to pick up the car they said I couldn’t have it as I failed the credit check. 1. They couldn’t have called to say you can’t have the car before going to pick it up several days after it was booked to give me an opportunity to sort it out. 2. Why do they not do a credit check before accepting your booking and taking your payment. 3. They do not highlight that they do a credit check or get you to tick a box to give permission for the credit check. Had they done this, we could have booked under my wife as I had an issue with being scammed and a fraud identity which is still impacting credit score.
They left me stranded unable to get to a family funeral which could have been completely avoided.
Obviously do not care about customers at all! Also they still have my money and I am yet to see my £150 returned!</div>

When I picked up the corsa if had unbelievable amount of scratches fir a car of say less than a year old body work and wheels totally damaged. Within the hour I Rang the company about all the Damage on the car which was not Discribed on my invoice document the said take pictures of the Damage ( luckily I did plus video footage). When I returned the car I also took more videos and pictures of the car just to be safe. Anyway 2 abd a half weeks later I received and email from a second party company representative if Europe car, They said I gave Damaged the car abd the are assessing the cost and would charge me, I was shocked as I emailed them saying I Reported the Damage that was nothing to do with me. After many phone calls and emails and me sending many mire video and pictures of the Damage they finally admitted the damage was nothing to do with me, To this Day I am still waiting for a Reply that why did it take them 2 and a half weeks to claim damages from me and also with a car with so much scratches why didn't they repair the car before the hire it out to the next customer.</div>

They told me a €100 deposit was included in the charges at the desk for pick-up, which I have not got back and had to raise a formal credit card dispute. They also gave wrong instructions to pick up the car, causing unwelcome delays with a baby. The staff were rude and dismissive and Europcar have closed my complaint even after I provided full details. Truly awful experience.</div>

                <div class='text'>My entire experience with Europcar has been nothing short of shocking and deeply disappointing. Upon arriving at the rental desk, I was told that my reservation was "blocked" without any clear explanation, despite having a confirmed booking through Carflexi. I was then told I had no choice but to pay double the original price (for a new contract) for a different vehicle on the spot. Feeling pressured and stranded, I had no other choice than to comply.

What followed was a series of deceitful and contradictory actions that made it clear this was not an isolated incident, but rather what felt like a systematic scam.

The agent handling my rental, someone named Sheikh, presented a false "upgrade" that I had never agreed to, and I was misled about what I was actually being charged for. It later turned out that I had been mistakenly identified as someone else with the same name, which Europcar themselves admitted in writing, confirming the error was entirely on their side.

However, when I requested a refund for the extra charges caused by their own mistake, Europcar refused to accept any further responsibility. They effectively cut off communication and showed no willingness to resolve the issue, leaving me with no option but to escalate the case to the European Car Rental Conciliation Service (ECRCS).

To make matters worse, days after ECRCS confirmed I would be refunded £157 for the unjustified upgrade fee, Europcar attempted to charge my card an additional £142 without my consent. The only reason this unauthorized charge failed was because I had already transferred all remaining funds from that account, leaving no balance for them to take. I then had to urgently contact my bank and request the card be frozen to prevent any further attempts. This added yet more stress and time to an already exhausting situation.

I have never in my life encountered a company that operates with such blatant disregard for honesty, accountability, and customer trust. I strongly urge others to avoid Europcar, especially at this location (London, Heathrow), unless you are prepared to be deceived, overcharged, and ignored when things go wrong.</div>

I signed their document only after being reassured by their staff member that my credit card would not be debited. On returning the car, by credit card was debited nearly 500 GBP for 'Premium Protection' cover. They refuse to refund or investigate the actions of their staff member.</div>

                <div class='text'>Booked a car only to be refused when I arrived because apparently my address couldnt be verified by their system!! I've lived here for 25 years!

They tried to get me to put my wife on the agreement at the cost of an extra £100. They knew I needed a car and that I'd made the journey there, so hoped I'd just do it.

Such a transparent tactic to make money.

I used Enterprise.

I know they are more expensive, but save yourself the pain and avoid these clowns.</div>

                <div class='text'>Booked a compact elite car, when I arrived to pick up the attendant at the desk was using fear mongering to get me to pay for extra protection cover which costed more than the total rental of the car. He told me that even if someone else scratches or hits my car I will have to pay a massive sum of money as excess. In the past I haven’t added this cover and had no issues but this time the attendant was being really pushy and made me feel so uncomfortable that I added it anyway. He made very clear to me the only charges that will come out my account is the extra protection charge, the deposit, and the toll payer. I double checked with him because I already felt very ripped off paying over double what I booked the car at and he reassured me that was all the costs- nothing else would be taken from me. After I gave my car back I got an invoice with 2 extra charges that made the total 3 TIMES what I initially agreed on. My card was already set up from when I collected so they took the money. I emailed them a whole month ago and they refuse to get back to me to explain why I was lied to about costs. DO NOT book with them, you will see a price online - multiply that be THREE if you want the actual cost of hiring it. Customer service doesn’t even exist so you won’t be helped after the fact either. Appalling company and I’ll never book with them again. Some of the cheaper companies are actually a lot better..</div>

                <div class='text'>AWFUL AND RUDE CUSTOMER SERVICE
These morons added numerous additional charges and charged my card without confirming or providing any evidence.
They claimed I drove into Europe or the Republic of Ireland, something I absolutely did not do. They refuse to listen to me and instead ignore those parts of the emails.
SAMUEL at customer service is an absolute idiot who uses AI to respond to emails. He can't even respond properly and doesn't acknowledge half of what you say.

DO NOT BOOK WITH EUROPCAR! They will charge you for things you did not do, they won't provide any evidence for it, and they have TERRIBLE customer service. The company should be ashamed.

I obviously will never book with Europcar again, and nobody else should either. Ignore this clown company.</div>

I rang to inform europecar very very early on within a few hours of the airport IT FAILIRE to tell them and that I could not pick up for 2 more days they said thanks for being so quick and helpful and that I would not be charged again ...but when I picked the car up they charged me again making up some very poor excuse because I booked with Ryanair.I have used them maybe 5 times and twice they have double charged me -the previous time I was with my very unwell Father....not nice at all and completely unfair in all the circumstances.</div>

                <div class='text'>I wrote a review back in March about the terrible service I am receiving with regards to damage to a car I rented last July. Well things just got worse. I am continuing to email them regularly, but have now reached a point where everyone has closed the case, Europcar, their lawyers, the third party insurers, but no one has paid me back my money! And in case Europcar comment saying please contact customer services, I have! At least 20 times. I will seriously be avoiding this company, and good luck anyone who's car is damaged, even if it's not your fault. Looks like they keep your money!</div>

                <div class='text'>Europcar are a disgrace don't use them.

They impose a ridiculously high accident excess of £1600 because they know this will then force the customer to take out the equally over priced extra charges for accident protection which is pretty much the same cost as the hire itself.

This £1600 is disgraceful, Europcar are basically extorting money from customers and they know it. Use Enterprise/AVIS anyone but this awful company.</div>

                <div class='text'>Absolute thievery. I paid for the vehicle on line on the proviso that I would pay a holding fee of £500 on collection to be released on return of the vehicle. The woman at the desk would not let us pay the holding fee via credit card, claiming that it wasn't working (It was working perfectly and is still working perfectly now) She then would not allow us to pay via phone using the credit card on the banking app. She claimed it was a problem with our card/bank It wasn't. She refused to let us try paying on a different terminal and put us in the position where we were forced to pay a non-refundable fee of £208 on debit card or cancel the hire losing the deposit in the process. We had two young children with us and a long journey to undertake so we had to pay. Unless this is resolved I will not ever use Europcar again and will encourage anyone and everyone that will listen that Europcar encourages immoral methods of obtaining payment.

                <div class='text'>I was told the car was full of fuel and to return it full. But when I got in it, it was only half full.
No problem I thought, I'll take a picture of the dashboard and get on with my journey or else I'd be late for my meeting. Just to be sure though, I phoned the customer service line when I was free a few hours later to report the half full tank. They said they'd log the issue and could I please email in my picture of the dashboard, which I did.

I topped up the tank back to the half full level with 20 litres petrol before returning the car 2 days later having driven 221 miles (petrol hybrid). I mentioned to the agent on return about the fuel issue and naively thought that would be it sorted.

How wrong could I be - having been charged to refuel back to a full tank, I got in touch to remind Europcar about all the efforts I'd gone to inform them that I received the car half full. They have subsequently accused me of lying about this! Their attitude to customer service is just unbelievable...I've hired plenty times over the years, all of which they have on record, yet they assume that out of nowhere after being an honest customer for years, I suddenly want to get £50 fuel from them? I've sent pictures of the dashboard at time of pick-up and return that are time-stamped, clearly proving that I am right. I've sent a picture of the receipt showing I filled up with 20litres fuel - an ideal volume to have travelled 221 miles in a hybrid car! What more evidence do they need. They've lost me as a customer for life now because they've accused me of dishonesty. There are plenty of other hire companies I can choose from instead.</div>

                <div class='text'>Every single time I have dealt with Europcar I have had nothing but problems!!!
I tried to book a vehicle as per my insurance company had advised.
It took 8 phones call over 2 days and 3 agents to finally get it booked.
I received an erroneous email confirming my booking for the wrong date and found that I’d been lied to by agents about the booking being made.
Then the car wasn’t delivered on time (over an hour late) after I called to find out where it was and was told.
The booking hasn’t been put on the computer.
Car was great in fairness, a few bits of damage (which I have photos and videos of) but ran like a dream.
Today I took the car to the garage as agreed and tried to advise Europcar I had left the vehicle as agreed.
6 phone calls, 2 agents and countless lies later (and being talked over) I’ve been advised that the car will be collected tomorrow.
I’m very sceptical and wouldn’t be surprised if it’s isn’t collected. I was promised written confirmation to protect myself and haven’t received it.
We’ll see if it is collected or not and if it isn’t I swear I’m going to go absolutely nuts!!!
I would rate 0 if I could and would highly recommend not using Europcar.
Interestingly I’m clearly not on my own.</div>

                <div class='text'>We hired a car from Bristol Airport. We have been charged an extra £86.28 at the end of the hire & no idea what for. Emailed the company to be told it was a verbal agreement with the staff member who dealt with us. There was no verbal agreement & no other service was sold to me. I was asked if I had the correct insurance which I had as I had purchased the premium insurance & the guy behind the desk was not happy I was not spending more money.
He then said that £186 had to be held on my credit card & it would be refunded. This was a lie & he has kept £86.28!!
I have emailed advising this is fraud & theft! Waiting on a response.
Do not use Europcar the are fraudulently taking money from people!!! Dreadful customer service</div>

                <div class='text'>Reading the reviews on here I realise I have experienced ALL of the same problems as other customers over a period of time whilst using Europcar on a regular basis.

I was accussed of tyre damage 6days after returning a vehicle, I challenged them asking for eveidence, the case was closed and I never received any eveidence.

I was then unknowingly charged for the additional Insurance, actially adding a further £884 to my hire, I challenged them again requesting for the CCTV from when I collected the car as I wished it to be viewed in the hope a lip reader could translate my conversation with the member of staff that dealt with the hire. The case was found in my favour & the case was closed.

A car I had on hire was parked outside my house, unfortunately another drived crashed into the hired car 🙄 I was assured by Europcar that the car would be collected & a replacement would be delivered, 2 days later still no replacement car, so I hired from another company as needed a vehicle for work purposes, Europcar had already lost me 2 days income 🙄
Several days later Europcar took a further payment from my account! Which then raised my hire by ££££'s! I have emailed & called then raising concern and asking for an explanation, to date I have received a email response advising "Once they obtain the relevant information they will be intouch" I sent them screen shots of everything with my initial email 🙃 The email they email me from you can't reply to 🤔
Several weeks later I have called them 3 times, each time being told they will contact a diffrent department as they can't help 🤪
My latest email May 30th asking Europcar for an update has received no reply 🥴

Oh yes! I was also accused of damaging a panel on one of their hired cars to! Luckily for me I took a video of all the vehicle inside & out before I left the hire depot, the case was closed. There is never any previous damage maked on the paperwork they give you on hiring a car, Please be wise and take a video 👍

Do I have to take them to the small claims court? 🙂

I swear NEVER Again!

                <div class='text'>From start to finish dreadful. Courtesy/hire car was arranged through AA insurance following our car being involved in an accident.
Europcar sent me a supposedly secure link so that my payment card for the £1 deposit was logged. About 4 hours later I received a telephone call from a private number with the caller saying he was from Fraud Prevention. I was asked if I had used my card within the last half hour, which I hadn't and was then asked if I had made a payment of £1 to Europcar earlier. I was told that a payment of £2000+ had been made using my card and that it would seem it had been cloned. My money would be refunded and a new card issued but I needed to give more digits from my card. I realised this was a scam so hung up and contacted my bank. They were very concerned about the caller knowing about Europcar and asked me to contact Europcar which I did. I was assured that this matter would be investigated by their Fraud Department and that I would be kept informed - I haven't.
As far as the courtesy car is concerned it was delivered and collected a day late with little communication.
Appalling.</div>

                <div class='text'>Absolutely disgusting service. I just spent 1 1/2 being placed on hold by 3 of their employees at the motability rental. They were rude. They didn’t know how to help me so fobbed me off by placing me on hold or either cutting me off. I’ve never ever had such bad service. It frustrated me so much i ended up having to take tablets for goodness sake.
After this experience I would suggest that Europcar Uk need to train their employees. Anybody could do the service they provide!! Crazy experience
And all I wanted was to find out where the rental car was that an employee there, yesterday PROMISED me that it would be delivered today. Obviously I guess it’s not coming today.

It’s left me so stressed out and wasted so much time when it could have taken only 1 employee that actually knew their job to tell me what is happening.</div>

                <div class='text'>Absolutely disgusting service.
I booked a car when I arrived to collect the car the customer service person was serving a customer and was upgrading the customer without consent with an additional charge.
I went to the counter and he tried the exact thing with me. I told him No and he still continued to upgrade my booking telling me it would only cost £200 for the upgrade. I got upset with this and told him I wanted the car I booked and he was very reluctant to give me the keys and accused me of being aggressive. I will never use this car hire service again.</div>

                <div class='text'>Terrible customer service after not being given the car that I booked through this website. I pre-paid and now I'm out of pocket £250 having spent 120 EUR to and from the airport. Heraklion airport let go of my reservation after not showing up for 2hrs per their T&C's but the UK office when I called assured me the car would be help after my arrival. I have called muliple times their customer service number and was hung up once, the others put on hold for an extended amount of time only to be told my case was closed and tough luck I'm out of pocket with no refund issued. DO NOT BOOK WITH THEM, it's a SCAM.</div>

                <div class='text'>Abysmal customer service experience.
Misled in to purchasing additional insurance that I didn't need - ended up costing more than the cost of the car hire. I noticed this an hour after taking the car out and got in contact to cancel to which they said to wait until the end of my hire. I waited until the end of my hire and now they are refusing cancellation of policy.
Additionally had car issues which I tried to sort over the phone. Continuously passed around department with no ownership being taken. Europcar employee told me to drive car (which wasn't working correctly or safely) to nearest branch (over a 2 hour round trip) or they couldn't help.</div>

                <div class='text'>Please take heed — I would strongly advise avoiding this car hire company. We booked our rental through Auto Europe, unaware at the time that they act as a broker and that the actual rental would be fulfilled by Europcar. Had we known this in advance and read the reviews, we would never have gone ahead with the booking.

Upon arriving at Verona Airport, we eventually located the Europcar desk, and that’s when everything began to go wrong. The staff member at the desk was very insistent that we purchase additional insurance, despite the fact that we had already bought full protection through Auto Europe. Even after I phoned Auto Europe and they confirmed we were fully covered, the staff member continued to push the insurance, making us feel pressured and uncomfortable.

When we were finally given the keys, we discovered that the car provided was completely different from what we had booked. We had reserved a VW Tiguan or similar SUV specifically to fit our passengers and luggage, but were given a saloon instead. I returned to the desk, where I was told that SUVs and saloons fall into the same category. I contacted Auto Europe again, and after speaking with the Europcar desk staff, they informed me that nothing could be done as Europcar uses a different classification system than Auto Europe.

Eventually, a more suitable car was located, but we were told we’d have to wait 30 minutes while it was cleaned. In reality, we waited far longer — not an ideal start to a long-awaited holiday.

The car we were eventually given wasn't in the greatest condition, but at least it could accommodate both our group and our luggage and done the job. Still, the overall experience was disorganised, frustrating, and disappointing.

We left feeling exhausted before our trip had even begun. Based on our experience, I cannot recommend Europcar or Auto Europe and would urge others to think twice before booking.</div>

                <div class='text'>I would never have hired a car through Europcars had I read the bad reviews and unfortunately have to echo previous reviewers experiences. Didn’t chose them specifically but Ryanair must hold a contract with them as it automatically booked the car with them. Picked up lovely shiny car from Knock airport - did a cursory look around the car - MAKE SURE YOU VIDEO EVERY PART INSIDE AND OUT OF CAR which we didn’t and surprise surprise on returning the car the staff rushed out with a little measuring device and said we had scratched the car on the bumper and it was going to cost almost 1000 euros to fix!!! Firstly the car was driven very carefully, parked in wide disabled places and kept in locked area and never left unattended. I believe the scratches were probably there before. Not checked and they must have thought we will charge us for them. 1000 euros for scratches that could even be rubbed out!!! They even invoiced us within the hour. Even though I have separate insurance I am challenging this as a matter of principle. DO NOT HIRE A CAR A CAR FROM THIS COMPANY</div>

                <div class='text'>Terrible business. Customer care is non existent. I have spent over 3 hours trying to speak to the Birmingham Newton branch. No one has answered. I have even attempted to call at 8am in the morning (when the business opens up), still no one answers the phone line. I have spoken to their customer service department multiple times, and they haven't been able to hlpe me. As a consumer, it appears that the branch simply doesn't have a phone line, or they're ignoring their phones ringing. I have dealt with countless numbers of businesses a cross all sectors as a consumer, I have never found any business this terrible. Europcar pride themselves on empowering mobility and helping their customers, it looks like they are doing everything besides sticking to their business culture. For anyone reading this review, just go to Enterprise Mobility (another car rental company). I'm not sure how this business is still in operation looking at their trash customer service.</div>

                <div class='text'>My daughter and son hired me a car from this company through Expedia. They paid extra for Expedia premium insurance. Expidia stated i need pay a £250 deposit. When I turned up at Gatwick airport from Latvia the representive said I had to pay £500 deposit which i never had. After a stressful wait my family transferred the extra money to my account. Europcar representive asked me to sign rental agreement which I did and they issued me a car. The car was returned 10 days later and I flew home. My £500 deposit was returned the following day. Then i had 2 payments taken from my account for £380, I found out that the representive had added premium insurance without my knowledge and after many emails to there customer service department they refused to refund the charge. I am a pensioner on a small income this has created me with financial problems. BE CAREFUL OF THIS COMPANY WATCH WHAT YOUR SIGNING FOR.</div>

                <div class='text'>When I wanted to extend the hire period, I called them and was told the van had actually been returned the day before, which is not true. I started calling them around 10:30 and kept trying until the afternoon, but still no answer. I was even on hold for hours, and no one was able to help. They kept pushing me from one person to another. It’s now 15:10 in the afternoon, and I still haven’t gotten an answer.

I wonder if the van shows as returned because I have the return statement and the invoice, for which I paid in full. However, the driver was charged for insurance again at the branch on the collection day.

What if I keep the van since no one has been able to fix this inconvenience? I would not recommend this service at all. Their communication skills are poor, and when I finally managed to get someone on the line, she hung up on me just because I was asked for stupid details that were not relevant at all, considering the van hire period was completely closed.
I am talking about the Stevenage branch and Peterborough branch.</div>

                <div class='text'>Awful experience. I was in the UK to move my mum into care following her strokes and I hired a car from Eurocar. I returned it, with no damage to the car, gas tank full, and got a return receipt as proof of that. I had already paid for the hire and full insurance prior to arrival, so when I queried the additional large charge to my credit card when I arrived back home 2 week later, I discovered they had in fact charged me twice for the one car hire. It has been extremely stressful given why I was in the UK in the first place, but then to have this extra charge on my card, it has caused me no-end of stress. I made a complaint, raised a claim and have heard NOTHING from them. They owe me almost £400 and I have not had any response from their claims team. PLEASE DON'T USE THEM. Unfortunately I am now involving a solicitor which they will end up paying for. Such a simple solution could have been given, with all my paperwork and proof of overcharges, they just needed to refund me. I hate giving bad reviews, but this time it is 100% warranted.</div>

                <div class='text'>Shameful Conduct at Stansted – Predatory, Dishonest & Utterly Disgraceful

Avoid Europcar at Stansted at all costs. My wife was traveling urgently to visit a critically ill family member and was emotionally vulnerable. Europcar staff seized the opportunity to pressure her into a vehicle upgrade she never asked for, slipping in a £142+ charge that she was never made aware of — all disguised beneath a rushed signature.

Let me be clear: this was not a misunderstanding. This was exploitation. A predatory upsell tactic targeting someone in distress. And when we raised the issue, Europcar HQ responded with a robotic, tone-deaf statement dismissing it entirely — citing a "signed document" as though it excused the behavior.

Worse still, the Cardiff Europcar branch reviewed the situation and told us clearly: 'this would never happen under our watch.' So yes — the Stansted team is acting on its own agenda and damaging the Europcar brand in the process.

This was manipulative, unethical, and cowardly. If this is how Europcar treats long-time customers and Privilege Members, they deserve every bit of reputational damage this review brings.

We are escalating this to senior management, Trading Standards, the Competition and Markets Authority, and the ECRCS.

You’ve lost our business permanently.

                <div class='text'>Utterly deceitful scammers.
They convinced my wife to upgrade, claimed it was a discount, but charged us 250 pounds a day, when the same car was listed on their website for less than 200 when I checked later in the day. The desk at Heathrow, led by Shane the manager, are nothing more than con artists who forcefully upsell and trick people into massively overpaying, and the customer service is useless when trying to recover some of the fees. Never, ever rent with Europcar. I had previously had decent experiences but will never deal with them again.

Edit: Europcar have replied asking me to contact their customer service, but I already did and they refused to do anything about it</div>

                <div class='text'>Rented a van, with only 650 miles on the clock, I drove it 30 miles and it averaged 38mpg. When I refilled the tank with diesel I was expecting to only put a gallon of fuel in. But, to my surprise I had to put 3 gallons in to replace (top up) what I had used as I was informed that the van had a full tank of fuel when I picked it up.

So, obviously the fuel tank wasn’t full when I picked the van up but I was told the tank was full and it should be returned with a full tank. I spoke with the branch manager at Chelmsford where I rented the van from and requested a refund for the 2 additional gallons of fuel that I had put in their van.

The million dollar question is… are they carrying out sharp practice to fleece their customers or is it some skullduggery from an employee, either way it’s not right.

Be warned make a note of the mileage and the average mpg used whilst in your rental.

I have twice been on their website to complain, filled in all the questions, written a lengthy complaint and when I pushed the upload button it defaults to “there is an issue with our webpage” handy so I am left writing this review to vent my frustration…

I have tried to contact customer services again as requested in their reply below and it still says there is a technical issue and it sends you back to the start again. It’s now 4 times that I have tried this method….Like the company it isn’t working properly 😡</div>

                <div class='text'>We hired a car through Europcar in France via a third party. All went well until we returned the car. The receiving agent spotted a scratch in the bonnet, that I hadn't seen at pick up, and had to squint in certain lights to see when she pointed it out. It could easily have been there when we picked up the car and I wouldn't have seen it. We rubbed the 'scratch' with a bit of water and a thumb and it appeared to be lifting, so I thought nothing more of it as I was convinced a polish would buff it out.

When I returned back to England I got a bill for £320 to repair the 'damage'. I tried to challenge them, but got stock corporate responses demonstrating how little they cared.

They are cheap, but avoid as you will be ripped off if there is any hint of damage. I will never use them again.

Despite getting the stock response from Europcar below and emailing them with details of my complaint, a month later and I'm still waiting for a response. Their treatment of customers is truly awful.</div>

I have just wasted most of the day on the phone being told lots of different things, still no car and there is nobody around at the Chelmsford office to answer calls, you just get put through to a call centre, where nobody is able to tell you what is happening.

                <div class='text'>Cannot stress enough, avoid, avoid, avoid. We used Europcar for a courtesy car recently and have had the worst experience - the customer service line is abysmal, when they can't answer your query they put the phone down or pass you back to the main menu. Our local branch won't answer the phone at all (to us or our insurance company) and we're having to chase repeatedly to get their car picked up from us. After being told there's no complaints department, we're close to giving up. There are plenty of other car rental companies, please avoid this one.</div>

                <div class='text'>Have been incorrectly charged by Edinburgh airport branch for over 500 miles worth of fuel evidently used by subsequent hirer despite my having returned the vehicle on time, in person with a staff member who signed it off assuring me he was satisfied no charges had been incurred. Double checked all was well since he seemed casual and initially barely looked at the car until I urged him to check it thoroughly. He also appeared to get the wrong paperwork from the office but confirmed he had corrected this which I now realise was not true. My complaints and evidence attesting to having returned a fully refuelled vehicle have been ignored.</div>

                <div class='text'>I rented a van from Europcar, and the experience was nothing short of disgraceful. The attendant at the reception was not just rude — she was downright hostile. She repeatedly pressured me to accept unnecessary add-ons and even went so far as to suggest I’d likely end up in an accident for declining the additional insurance excess reduction. That kind of fearmongering is completely unacceptable. She asked the same intrusive questions multiple times — “How far are you going?” “When exactly are you bringing it back?” — in a tone that made me feel like I was begging to borrow her personal vehicle rather than paying to rent from a major company. The whole exchange was uncomfortable, condescending, and frankly, humiliating. At one point, I was so taken aback by her attitude, I genuinely considered walking away and telling her to keep the van. Renting a vehicle shouldn’t feel like being interrogated or talked down to. If this is how Europcar treats paying, polite customers — then count me out for good. I wouldn’t recommend this branch to anyone. Absolutely dreadful service.</div>

                <div class='text'>This was the worst car rental experience I’ve ever had.

From the beginning, we were treated with arrogance and disrespect. I had booked a decent car, and they handed me a wreck – filthy, falling apart, and barely drivable. It looked like it belonged in a junkyard. An absolute disgrace.

I had purchased full insurance coverage, so I wasn’t supposed to be charged for anything. Still, they held a deposit of £125, which was initially released, and then they took the money from my account after I had already left, with no explanation. That’s not a mistake – that’s outright theft.

This is not just poor service – it’s dishonest and unethical. Europcar in Tunis is running a scam. What they’re doing is not car rental, it’s abuse and legalized robbery.

Avoid this company at all costs. I wouldn’t wish this experience on anyone.</div>

                <div class='text'>The rental agreement on checkout at Newcastle had an existing damage described. When I checked the car in at Gatwick, the man gave me a form to sign on an iPad that had no description of any damage. He later (after I had signed and left) inserted pictures of the existing damage into the signed document under “new” damage. Completely unethical and illegal. Europcar are now claiming the original rental agreement was not signed and counter signed so the existing damage is not counted as existing but new! This company cannot be trusted. Avoid! To top it off, the original cost was £147 but I ended up paying £304. I’m astounded by the lack of customer service when trying to resolve this matter.</div>

                <div class='text'>Professional scammers. Stay away. One of the worst experiences we had with a car rental company. We ended up paying €1000 for a basic 208 Peugeot which on their website was €300 when we initially paid for it. They also scammed us with €200 for a 3cm scuff on the wheel which was there before we rented the car, I showed the picture to them and the representative said I shouldn’t worry because it’s covered by the insurance (this was of course a lie) but they just need to record it for the next rental. They then also billed €87 for the damage admin fee. Be prepared to never see your deposit back and once you return the car if you don’t have a credit card then make sure you move the money from your account as they will just start charging random amounts to your debit card. Make sure you email all photos and videos and detailed description 1hr after you get the car as otherwise they won’t care what photos or videos you have. They lie, scam and steal and add secret charges that you didn’t ask for. We didn’t ask for roadside assistance and somehow it showed up on the invoice. There’s also a massive airport fee which they don’t tell you about in advance. Every price they say is without VAT, which they forget to mentioned. Do yourself a favour and find a local/family owned company outside of the airport and never go near Europcar as you will be robbed. Hopefully someone will eventually win a legal case against them.</div>

                <div class='text'>I enquired on their website to ask if they would hire me a Peugeot 3008 for 35 days before I complete the booking by transferring to the payment section and received a vague response from Gabriela of their reservation team - saying that 'due to the dynamic nature of our pricing system we are unable to guarantee prices over email'
Having been bitten before now by finding out at the last minute that they hire for a max. of 30 days I wanted an answer before spending £3,400.

                <div class='text'>Bait and Switch, it's their standard practice from my experience. Just this morning I spoke to a friend who had exactly the same experience with these shonky pricks.
They present you with two sets of keys (presumably because they don't have the car you have already booked and paid for), then, when you ask what the price difference is, they say "50 pounds", or "30 pounds" in my friends case.
They conveniently forget to mention PER DAY.
My friend was clever enough to catch them before he signed. I was not, and it tripled the cost of the rental. They have no interest in reversing the transaction with ended up costing my wife and I (who were both at the desk, and both heard the Europcar staffer NOT mention that it was a daily charge), 1250 pounds extra!
Read the other reviews. You will find that it is their standard tactic. They are amoral and unprofessional.
Complete shysters.

                <div class='text'>BUYER BEWARE if you are thinking about renting a car from Europcar.
After reserving and paying for a car rental through a third party before leaving the United States, on arrival in Southampton I presented the 3rd party rental voucher to the Europcar agent who accepted it without comment. He told me, however, that the car I reserved was not available and I was offered an upgrade for £9 a day extra for the 14-day rental period. I accepted this and the agent made out a rental agreement reflecting the upcharge. At no time did the agent in Southampton tell me that the payment we made through the 3rd party would be disregarded and that Europcar would be re-billing the entire rental amount again. However, 4 days after returning the car, Europcar charged my credit card the full rental price plus the upgrade charge. In other words, I ended up paying for the car twice.
After calling the company’s customer service three times and explaining the situation by email, my complaint fell on deaf ears. I was finally told that the voucher I presented in Southampton and that the agent accepted and kept without comment had not been applied.
To add insult to injury, upon returning the car at the exact time and date stated on the rental agreement (as confirmed by the agent who received the car), I was charged for an extra day after being told the car should have been returned an hour earlier.
Apart from being conned out of more than $500, the worst part of this experience has been trying to communicate with a company that is completely deaf to their customers concerns. The customer service rep., who is located somewhere overseas, will let you talk about your problem endlessly and then do nothing about it. Ask to speak to a supervisor: ‘sorry there are none’. I have to assume that using bait and switch tactics to justify ignoring payments from third parties is a common Europcar practice in order to avoid paying fees to those parties.
Since we still needed an additional rental in the UK, we discovered Drivalia, which came highly recommended. It is understandable because their rates are half of what Europcar charges and their customer service reps are extremely friendly and accommodating.
Hopefully, my own experience with Europcar’s unethical business practices will serve as a caution to anyone in future looking to do business with an ethical car rental company.

Review update: In response to Europcar's standard corporate response.
We had already contacted Europcar 4 times by phone and email, detailing the complaint. They have either not bothered responding at all or on one occasion were completely dismissive.
The attempt by Europcar to act like they care now is nothing more than a laughable PR stunt.</div>

On my return I inspected the vehicle and proceeded to do a short run to the local store but found the tyre warning light on, I thought maybe the tyre needed pumping up , after a 8 minute journey the tyre went completely flat resulting in calling out the AA and being escorted to quick fit for a new tyre, the AA engineer found a tyre valve wedged in the wall of the tyre.
Eurocar want me to pay £159 for a new tyre which is an absolute disgrace.
They should have let me inspect the vehicle before leaving the keys with someone els , as now I can’t prove the vehicle was ok at time of drop off.
SO I SAY DONT EXCEPT A VEHICLE WITH EUROCAR UNLESS YOU INSPECT IT INSIDE AND OUT .</div>

                <div class='text'>As we've said many times yes we signed a contract but we were told an untrue story about our luggage which was not corroborated by their other 2 depots namely our luggage was too big. The other depots both said we should not have been charged more for the car and they hadn't heard of any luggage laws as told to us.
1. We asked the guy in Edinburgh to try our luggage in the car we hired but he refused. He told us there were restrictions on putting luggage on the rear seat (a small carry on bag) He also told us the police were on the lookout for hire cars doing this on the North Coast 500, not knowing the laws we believed him. But I haven't seen any corroboration on the internet to say this is true.
2. We went to Inverness to swap our car as instructed by Europcar's head office via email.
3. Inverness advised us he had not heard from head office and advised us to keep going as smaller cars are like hens teeth. What did they expect us to do? We had already paid $1900aus and had pre booked accommodation.
4. We only signed because we had to have something because we were booked ahead.
5. At no time after we went to Inverness depot were we instructed to go back for a smaller car which we would have done. So why were we instructed to go to Inverness only to find no car available, and why weren't we told to come back the next day or at some other time...were we expected to walk around Scotland??
All of the above borders on a shonky deal and we have been trying to resolve this since April 24th....how long does it take.
The contract was signed after we assumed the story we were told was true but since found out it was dubious at best so....if you sign a contract under wrong assumptions it should be voided. Was the initial amount we paid not considered?
The car had lollies and other packets in the glove box...the guy in Edinburgh said we might have to fill up with Adblue which we had to do on the first fill of the tank....this should be done by Europcar not the customer...there was no manual in the car so we could not learn anything about how the controls worked. We would never recommend Europcar to anyone, quite the opposite especially when we have been fobbed off with the phrase "but you signed the contract" so even though we were told a story to get us into a bigger car which we didn't want and didn't order it doesn't matter to Europcar?
We booked a Citroen C3 or similar and we would have easily fit our luggage in that sized car. When we took the car back to Manchester Trafford Park the man who took delivery of the car was called Usama and he told us we should not have to put Adblue in the car as it's Europcar's job to do it...he said the guy in Edinburgh might have lied to get a bigger bonus...he said we would be reimbursed for the Adblue and the bond money both of which we are yet to see.
Thanks,

I have selected no extra protection at the website, then I said I don't want extra protection at the woman when I was taking the car but she has sneak extra protection at the papers.

                <div class='text'>We booked a car via sunny cars for eur 350. When we came back home I received an extra amount to pay of eur 500 for upgrade car, surcharge airport and insurance. This is what happenend.

We were in a hurry , because we had a delay with the airplane and had a meeting. The woman who helped us , Sharon, was very nice and said to help us as quickly as possible and that everything was taken care of. She said that she would provide us with a nice car. She saw that we already had full coverage via Sunny cars so also no need to check the car.
“ We have to block a certain amount on your credit card but that is for deposit purposes only” she said “ You just have to sign here , here and here and then you can go “

So that is what happened . When we were back in the Netherlands I received your mail about the credit card payment. AN EXTRA eur 500 ( apart from the gasoline which is OK )

This is part of their business model . BE CAREFULL with EUROPCAR UK</div>

                <div class='text'>I got a hire car through the RAC until my car goes into repair with Arnold Clarke next week. Thought great it’s coming within a few hours but once the car arrived I wasn’t happy at all. I was told the car was with the valeting team before it gets delivered which was a lie. The car is filthy to the point the cloth I used was black after wiping down all the interior. The carpets are full of crumbs, dirt and stains which look like blobs of sick 🥴 It also smells horrible it’s a 74 plate MG which is the same year as my car with just over 10,000 miles for a car to smell the way this does you’d think it was 12 years old and never cleaned. For someone that’s on a mobility scheme for my child & have my child in this filthy was just not a option I will be cleaning it for my use only but I will not be returning it immaculate as this is not the condition it was delivered in very disappointed and haven taken pictures as proof.</div>

                <div class='text'>Scamming extras out of nowhere.

We booked a small car to go away for the long weekend in the beginning of May and everything went well, they even gave us an upgrade which was amazing. Quick to pick up the car, great to bring it back, everything speedy...

However.... not being a local and not having driven loads in the UK roads, it can be extremely hard to avoid getting an automatic fine. I went into a bus lane on a Monday (bank holiday though) on an empty road, at a junction that is designed so you will unavoidably touch the bus lane if you are not laser focused on the markings on the road. A very scammy, tricky place to get a fine.

I get the fine on my email. £35. Angry but i said ok, better luck next time. Then i see that Europcar thinks its ok to add a £45 'administration' fee, as if they have to do anything time consuming, other than send an email.

So they want MORE than the fine because what you can do? Its in the booklong terms and conditions.

Fear not, i will pay you this administration fee but you WILL NEVER SEE ME AGAIN as a customer.

I took great care to be careful with the car and return it in great shape, i was on time and i get 'fined' with nothing, so you can pocket easy money? That's the last you will ever see from me again. Bye!</div>

                <div class='text'>Absolute scammers. A car crashed into my rental while I was 15 miles away. The company have ignored my requests for any information on the insurance claim, only able to send invoices and debt collectors. It's been seven months since the driver knocked my door and admitted fault. They've given me no communication on the insurance and now im at a dead end where every department has told me they dont deal with this but also refuse to give me another department to try. I have even explained im happy to pay the money I just want to see some documentation on the insurance outcome as over one month after they confimed they hadn't started this process yet. I just want to know how to get reimbursement when the insurance claim goes through. Don't use this company if you like your sanity.... Absolute disgraceful service</div>

Reservation confirmed and payment of £203.54 was taken from my bank account immediately (14/05/25). At approx 6.00pm the same day I received a phone call to inform me the car I had paid for was no longer available. I was asked if I wished to upgrade. I refused and asked for a full refund immediately. Despite the inconvience of having to sort another car rental our at such a late date the worst thing is I have still not received a refund despite phone calls and emails. Europcar were quick to take the money but 6 days for a refund seems a bit much! DO NOT USE this company.</div>

                <div class='text'>Would have given 0 stars if option

Seems to be a theme about mis selling insurance. I am currently "in conversation" with customer services about added extras I never ordered and I am looking for a refund. I never requested roadside assistance or personal protection but these were added to invoice. This is a scam where they make these additions part of your deposit. It is basically theft.

Customer services have now told me that cannot do anything as they were not part of verbal conservation at location - they have said that I should have been offered extras and asked to accept or decline which never happened.

So basically buyer should be aware of this practice and scrutinise what you are signing up for and make sure no extras have been added surreptitiously

I would also beware of premium location surcharge that is added to costs.
I certainly will not hire from them again.</div>

                <div class='text'>AVOID. Terrible hire company.

Paid to hire a van online, money came out of my bank. Rang the HQ the day before to confirm everything is good to go for the hire day, they confirmed that the van will be ready and everything has gone through fine. When I turned up to pick up the van I PAID to hire, I got told they do an “eligibility” check to see if you can afford to pay the fees. I got declined, even though I already paid for the hire. There’s no credit?? What hire company does credit checks for something not on credit? Afford rent a car, enterprise are MILES better than these cowards. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.

They are doing a scam at the moment (particularly with new electric cars) where you are led to believe you are getting a complimentary upgrade.

                <div class='text'>I recently had a car delivered by Europcar mobility section while my mobility car was being repaired after I was rear ended, the car was left outside my property unlocked and they left the key and paperwork with my son, when I went out to the car the next day I found it had a couple of dents that weren’t on the paperwork.
When they picked up the car I made sure it had a full tank of fuel, but then they tried taking £49.60 out of my bank account, I complained and sent proof of the amount of fuel it had in, they then admitted it was full but are now trying to make me pay for delivery and return mileage fuel ! This company are Scam artists!!!</div>

                <div class='text'>Edit 26 May: It is impossible to get hold of anyone on the phone or via email. It all looks professional but there is ZERO customer service. Do not go near this company.

For a 6 day hire my bill so far is gbp 400 plus deposit. I feel totally ripped off. I have not been able to drive the car because a tyre had 2 holes in it and no one was interested in resolving the problem. I have been stuck in one place waiting for repairs to be done. There was no spare tyre.
I went through Rentalcar.com which is a broker. I was in a difficult situation and had to hire in a hurry for a next day, Saturday, start. I requested a Leeds city pick up and Manchester airport drop off on Thursday. I was charged 233gbp, then 85gbp extra when I went to pick up the car because the ‘different drop off location’ had ‘dropped off’. Plus a deposit which was ok and expected, if large. There was another extra charge for road usage when I picked up the vehicle. Prices are advertised in GBP but my UK credit card was charged in NZ dollars - I’m using an NZ mobile phone and drivers license but there was no obvious option to change the currency quoted/charged in. So then the insurance cover was added - the wording strongly suggests you need their full insurance offer. This was £65 for 6 days. Charging my UK credit card in NZ$ incurred four times unnecessary conversion fees. By now I’m committed and don’t have time (or energy because I’m dealing with a family emergency and really need a good reliable car, right now) to find another supplier so accepted the deal.
I booked a 10am pick up. There was a 15’ wait before being able to begin completing the paperwork and pick up the car. The car itself is ungroomed in the interior, and didn’t drive well from the get go. Shortly after leaving the pick up point an alarm appeared saying ‘tyre pressure low’. I did not have time to deal with this immediately. When I called Europcar (the end supplier) two days later, by which time the wheel alignment feels obviously wrong, I waited a very long time for an answer and was eventually shunted through to someone who turned out to be the AA who came out to check the car through their breakdown service. Whilst the AA is always great, I could have called them on my own membership and saved the 30 minutes + waiting for Europcar to answer. So at this point I had no usable car (for which I’ve paid a very expensive total hire rate) and was stuck waiting for a roadside rescue service to help me out with ‘my’ problem. The AA turned up as promised an hour later, removed a nail ‘which has been in there a long time’, did a temporary fix so I could get to some local appointments early the next day (having by now not been able to get to that day’s necessary hospital visit and run other urgent medical-related errands), and booked a new tyre service Kwikfit who replaced the tyre the next day. They found another nail in the tyre and let slip that poor quality tyres on loaned-out vehicles are a common problem with Europcar vehicles. The worst part of this is that Europcar do not answer the phone and even when they do couldn’t give a damn. When I did eventually get through to a customer service agent she was smugly rude by just meeting my concerns with deliberate silence. She finally put me through to ‘the local branch’ (an ad loop telling lies about how great Europcar is) which clearly no one answers) where I was on hold over 30’ before I gave up. Worst customer experience ever. Will never use rentalcar.com or Europcar ever again.</div>

                <div class='text'>I've never left a bad review for the response to a bad review before!
The usual terrible experience that so many of you have described (Europcar rang us 2 hours before we were supposed to pick up the car from Morpeth station saying they don't do pick ups at stations! The 'solution', after much wrangling was a drop off at our hotel, incurring huge drop off fees which they failed to tell us about, but they already had our credit card details, so they just took the money without telling us). The result was we payed over £300 for a 3 day hire, which we had NOT signed up for. I got a generic response to my review (that looked good on the review page) - 'we're so sorry etc, contact customer services on this phone number (didn't work) or this email (bounced back) or via our website (hooked into a loop that there is no response to). So I am admitting defeat and am going to sign it off as a really bad customer experience in which I was cheated by Europcar.
But as there is no option to respond to their 'helpful' response, I am leaving another review here. I'll probably get another 'we're so sorry etc' reply to this, but it goes nowhere, don't be fooled!
I hate leaving bad reviews, but I am still feeling angry about this.</div>

                <div class='text'>I would give this company 0 stars. First the try to scam you by getting bigger car, then try to scam insurances on you, then if you don’t take additional insurance they contact you months later and try to scam you that there was a damage that never happened and not written on your return report. Scammers from start till the end. DO NOT RECOMMEND!</div>

                <div class='text'>Respect yourself, your time and your money - stay away from Europcar GLA Office!
Very strong price pressure on car upgrade and purchasing unnecessary services, threatening with fictitious penalties, manipulating documents, adding additional fees etc.

A good tip for your safety - record the conversation with their staff when picking up and dropping off the car, always talk in the presence of witnesses, take lots of photos and do not arrange anything with them verbally, do not allow them to add anything to the contract, keep an eye on the documents at all times, when returning car request an employee's signature stating that the vehicle was returned without damage and refueled!!!

or choose someone less greedy ;-)</div>

                <div class='text'>Very disappointed
I was requested under pressure to pay extra £71.40 as “After Hours” fee when we arrived Birmingham airport for car collection.
Due to a flight delay, we arrived at 11:04 PM—just 4 minutes past office hours
We did promptly call their office at 7:30pm (UK time) in Italy before departure once we knew there was flight delay. This staff, who is on duty, confirmed he could wait up to 30 minutes beyond the usual closing time – until 11:30 PM. We expressed our deep appreciation in phone.
Before making the car booking, we contacted your Customer Service team to clarify what would happen in the event of a flight delay, given that your office hours end at 11:00 PM. We were assured that, as long as we provided our flight number, your staff would monitor our arrival and wait for us accordingly. Based on this reassurance, we proceeded with the booking and submitted our flight information
We explained our situation and referenced the prior conversation with that staff. However, he remained adamant. When we requested an official policy document justifying this charge, he became defensive, accused us of being impolite, and refused to provide any documentation. He then stated that unless we paid the fee, he would close the office and WITHOUHOLD the car.
Adding to our discomfort, before demanding the late fee, this staff spent over five minutes trying to upsell us additional insurance. We informed him that we had already purchased full coverage. He replied confidently—but misleadingly—that full coverage did not include wheels and tires, and pressured us to purchase more coverage. When we declined, his attitude changed abruptly, and he immediately brought up the “After Hours” charge.
Lastly, when we arrived at 11:04 PM, the staff member had just finished completing the documentation for the previous customer. He was not simply waiting in the office for serving us.
I fully agree that flight delay was not Europcar’s fault and was not their responsible for this either.
However, they did not keep promise and still charged us after failing to sell us insurance, simply because we were only 4 minutes late.
They not only refused to issue a refund, but also failed to provide any documentation justifying the 'late charge' as per their Terms and Conditions
Please think carefully before ordering a car from them, even if their initial prices seem cheaper.</div>

                <div class='text'>I had an accident with my car (not my fault) and received a replacement car similar to mine, from Europcar. It took about 40 days to fix my car so during this time I did about 2,000 miles. When finally my car was ready, I was told that I can leave the rental at the repair garage, as this was apparently, the usual practice. It took Europcar 3 days to collect their car and I received the collection report with all the images, which looked okay. I've been driving for more than 40 years, dozens of different rental cars around the world, never had a damage. I did not suspect any problems with the rental car, as usual.
What was my surprise when a month later I got a message from Europcar stating there was damage to the rental car worth nearly a £1,000! There was no visible damage to the car while in my possession and I am not aware of anything like that! The images presented were magnified x20, making minor scuffs and scratches look massive. The car was not at the place where I left it, and was also cleaned. There was no mention in the contract that 2mm scuffs will be considered a damage worth £1,000!
I feel so sorry I accepted their service as they are clearly after ripping off their customers. The car was not even repaired, it was rented again to other people, and the damage claimed is barely noticeable. They took advantage of me as I was so stressed by the accident I had. Europcar made me sign documents I was not in a proper state to thoroughly read, made me agree to a huge excess (£1,000, no coincidence?), they even claimed a damage described in their paperwork upon vehicle delivery.
I would strongly recommend - DO NOT use Europcar! They would only try to rip you off as much as they can! I wish I never had to use their lousy service and will, most definitely, avoid Europcar from now on. Europcar is an absolute disgrace!</div>

                <div class='text'>The experience with the car itself was fine.

What really let me down was the treatment I received.
I arrived with my quote for the car ready, online check in completed, ready to pick up my vehicle.

Then the employee proceeded to ask me what option I wanted for insurance, giving me only two, and choosing his words deliberately making it sound like what I was choosing was the option that would leave my quote unaltered.

Perhaps there was an element of me being naive but the same thing happened to the person before me, so I tend to think it’s a tactic they use.

When it came to the payment, lo and behold, the price was DOUBLED.
So, when they give you insurance options, make sure to ask what ALL your options are, and make sure to specify that you want the cheapest/no additional insurance. Otherwise they will try to take you for all you’re worth.

That’s without even mentioning the lack of care, they are supposed to come out and show you the car’s features, how to use it, etc.
Mine was an EV which I had never used before, he just gave me the keys and sent me on my way.

Overall extremely negative experience.</div>

                <div class='text'>Avoid at all costs!

My insurance company gave me a rental car from Europcar for a week in September 2024. Everything went smooth and handed back the car with no issues. After 7 months my insurance company had called me saying that Europcar have put a claim through mentioning there is a chip on the windscreen! They blamed me for it after 7 months which surely doesn’t make sense! You have customers all the time using your vehicle so how can they accuse me for it? They didn’t call me or send me anything and next thing you know I have been charged £619.89 on my credit card out of nowhere without consent. No mention from them for this charge at all. This is fraud!!!! Avoid these scammers! I have called them up and they just mention they have put a dispute in. 1 week later no call back nothing. They have stolen my money!</div>

                <div class='text'>Miss sold upgraded car
We arrived to pick up our car 20 minutes early and were told our car was not ready and that they could not tell us when our car would be ready. But that if we wanted we could take an upgraded car that was ready to go for £20.
Given that I had 2 young children (4 and 1) with me and we’d been on a long flight, I didn’t want to wait an indefinite length of time for the car I’d booked to be ready, so I said I would pay £20 in order to take the car that was ready and leave the airport.

It was only once my card was charged that I double checked the contract and had been charged £20 PER DAY. Had this been clearly explained there is no way I would have paid £200 to leave the airport 20 minutes early. The upgrade was not sold honestly and I have been left feeling tricked by what is meant to be a reputable company.
Would definitely not recommend and be very careful in trusting any information given to you in person

Also, please do not reply saying to raise an issue on the link as you have with the negative reviews of other people, I already submitted a complaint using this process on 28 April and have received no response 10 days later</div>

                <div class='text'>So unbelievably bad it's shocking. My first experience with them was a year or so ago when I booked a van to move house. They cancelled the night before and ruined everything. Unfortunately I had forgotten this when I booked a car for a weekend away recently. I thought I had paid for everything online (about £200 for 4 days I think) only to be charge over £150 more when I got to the airport (Manchester). I was also told they were offering a "deal" on an upgrade to an automatic - they told me the *upgrade* was an extra £100/day usually but that they'd reduced it to £40 as an offer. Not only am I fairly sure this was a lie (it's not £100/per day more online), the *per day* part was said very quietly. Then they gave me an automatic anyway! A few weeks later I got an admin fee of £45. I believe it easily cost more than double what Avis would have charged (I have used them before and they were honest and transparent and I highly recommend them). This felt like a scam. I'm still angry over a month later.</div>

                <div class='text'>Con merchants! Avoid
We rented a vehicle from Europ car at Belfast airport, we were in a rush so signed what I was asked to sign as thought it was just a standard rental agreement, had the car for three days , filled the vehicle up before taking it back and everything seemed ok .
Got back home and thought I would check my credit card transactions and noticed they had charged me £480 ! So I read through the paperwork and found they had put all these upgrades and charges on top of my original booking without my consent! So I called up customer services to complain and they also informed me that I had also been charged for fuel top up even though I had filled it up at a fuel station less than half a mile away from I had to drop the vehicle back to … very dishonest company and staff</div>

                <div class='text'>We had booked a 9-seater Mercedes van on line for a short holiday in Spain. Arrived at Malaga Airport on 5th April. We thought it would be quick service to get our vehicle. Were made to wait an unreasonable amount of time while the staff struggled to locate a Mercedes vehicle. After some delay, the customer service agent remarked, “At last, I’ve found the Mercedes van for you,” and then immediately pushed a rental agreement towards me for signature.
This document listed more than half a dozen scratches, broken parts, and damages — yet none of this was explained or reviewed with me in any way. Most of the text appeared to be in Spanish, with only a few vague English notes.
After waiting for over 30 minutes at the desk, we were handed the keys and told to collect the vehicle from level -2 of the car park. Not only was this an inconvenient distance from the desk, but the underground storage was extremely poorly lit — making it nearly impossible to conduct a proper inspection of the car.

We were told to report any additional damage within 24 hours or risk being held liable for anything not listed. Due to the lighting conditions, we were unable to thoroughly inspect the vehicle. We drove it out and parked at a nearby shopping centre, where we finally had a chance to properly look over it. What we discovered was shocking: the vehicle had over two dozen scratches on the bodywork and extensive internal damage, including loose parts that rattled loudly during the short drive. It was very clear that this vehicle was not roadworthy and should never have been released for rental.
Have already complained (22966365). No explanation has been provided in response to my formal complaint, which I find unacceptable. This response lacks the seriousness the matter deserves and reflects poorly on how Europcar treats its customers.
Don't rent a car through Europcar at Malaga airport. Their cars are parked too far underground, and you cannot inspect the vehicle because of poor lighting. Avis or other cars are parked at a reasonable distance. The message is clear - AVOID Europcar. They only want your money by even putting your life at risk</div>

                <div class='text'>I had a very disappointing experience with Europcar. I had planned to rent a car for a long weekend, and although they accepted my booking, they failed to provide the specific vehicle I reserved. There were no suitable alternatives offered, and I was left with no real choice but to accept whatever was available. I ended up cancelling my rental which ruined my weekend plan. Not received my money as well. The lack of transparency and poor customer service were extremely frustrating. I do not plan to rent from Europcar again and would not recommend them to others.</div>

                <div class='text'>I am sure I am not the only customer being abused financially by this no name company . I booked to rent a car for few days however I realised that I messed up the dates . I rung to cancel and I have been told that I need to pay £45 as my cancelation was not done with 48 hours before. I tried to explain as much as I could however apparently those are the policies of the company . This company appears very unprofessional and more then this they made the rules how they want . I hope and I wish that sooner then latter they will be close down , looking on all those bad reviews somebody needs to take some legal actions . I will go forward with my complain as I felt being financially abused by them in a country when everyone should be treat with respect and dignity .</div>

                <div class='text'>DO NOT HIRE A CAR FROM THESE SCAMMERS We had pre-ordered hire car which included insurance. I picked up the car from Glasgow airport and signed for the car. Later when I looked at the paperwork I noticed I had been charged for premium protection and roadside assistance. I did not ask for this and I was not told this had been added to the rental cost. I have been mis-sold and taken advantage off. The staff at you Glasgow airport desk do not operating in a customer friendly manor.

                <div class='text'>What a trapdoor this company is. Stay away please take my advice. The errors this company has made against me has cost me thousands of pounds. I am currently trying to retrieve over £1100 that Europcar took out of my account on a saturday morning without any authorisation and having never had a hire car from them. I tried to get a hire the previous month for work for 30 days. I entered everything for them and paid in full before going to collect the car from Manchester airport. When I got there the very aggressive and uninterested staff informed me that they were going to do a credit check on my address. I was not worried as I own my own house lived there for years and don't do credit or debt. The guy comes back and refuses me the car hire. I'm like hang on this can't be right. Also why was this check not done before I'd paid my money. The staff refused to help me I any way and would not allow me to speak to a more senior member of staff. There message to me was go somewhere else you are not getting anything from us today. I was left standing there having giving up the day to collect the car in the first place. I was informed that it would take 20 days to get my money back. Europcar held my money in their account making interest for days before I eventually got it back. No car and no money for 10 days. I launched an investigation to find out why my address had an issue only to find out that the poorly educated and extremely rude member of staff had entered next doors address. I feel he did it on purpose. These guys were a real bad bunch at Manchester Airport Branch. On the 28th April for no reason Europcar took from my account the money again. I have still nor had it back. There is no one to complain to at Europcar there is no real customer service to speak off. These accessed my personal data withdraw money from my account and have held onto it. I have had to register it as a theft with he police I've had to buy a vehicle in order to start my new job at the cost of £8000 taxed and insured lost days in work as a result of it. I don't think I've ever been so badly treated by a company in my life. I actually thought that this type of behaviour by a company was not possible in this day and age but it is. Don't be fooled by this company with the green t-shirt and little euro logo this guys are scam artists and should not be trading at all. I will be bring to the whole thing to trading standards and data protection etc. I never take the time to write reviews but I am writing this to try and save others from being scared like I was. Please stay away from these guys especially at the Manchester Airport branch.</div>

                <div class='text'>The actual car rental was fine and smooth. After I returned the car , a payment of £10.13 was taken from my account without my knowledge. Tried calling several times and I’ve been going round in circles, last call someone actually answered then I was given a recording for a survey and they hung up. In effect, if they want money from you they will pick up other than that they are not interested.</div>

                <div class='text'>I wish I'd read the Reviews here before ever using Europcar @ London Stansted Airport & wish I could give a negative score! We had never hired a vehicle before & could almost see ££s signs in the rep's eyes when he asked us. My husband did ask if the car we had booked had a Sat Nav system (Ford Focus or similar booked via Booking.com) & were told that only new electric cars had these. He then went into back office & bought out 2 sets of keys for a Hyundai Kona & a Volvo car - no sign of our original request!! After being bombarded with insurance information & other additional charges told that the insurance already taken out with Booking.com was useless, so told to take out their additional insurance - even charged more for the One-Way charge than anticipated - altogether had to pay an additional £400 for a car we didn't request or need!!! We weren't even shown to the car or shown around the vehicle to check for any damage & it was getting dark by the time we finished with the reams of paperwork. We didn't even know how to start the car initially & had to figure out how to operate the Sat Nav ourselves! The final figure on the Rental Agreement was deducted from my husband's bank account but then adjusted after leaving the Desk. All in all - a totally traumatic experience, which was unexpected & we left shell-shocked. I think the staff are trained to confuse customers into signing up for additional services that they do not want or need. I think that they make customers feel cheap & uneducated if they question the explanation for additional services. I wouldn't recommend this company to my worst enemy. I contacted Booking.com with these details and think they are aware of their practices as they refunded the insurance that I took with them without any questions & advised that the deposit (which we didn't know would be deducted either) would be returned within 28 days but not much else. PLEASE DO NOT HIRE VEHICLES FROM THEM - we will never ever use them.</div>

                <div class='text'>Thieves, they will steal your money.

I was given a courtesy car, RED MG, in January 2025. They collected it in February 25. On 28/03/25 they charged my card £163.56. I called to ask why they said it was for a Parking fine. I asked for proof which they took their time in sending. The parking fine was for a WHITE VESPA in LONDON. An entirely different vehicle type. Not just that, they don't have common sense. I live 300miles(one way) away from London. The mileage I used in the duration of me having the courtesy car was below 250miles.

Multiple times I have contacted them, but they have usurped the money, refusing to admit that they should have checked before paying the fine or at the very least contacted the Hirer before paying the fine. They keep saying to contact the Parking authority and there is no way to contact them. The Parking Authority's website states fines cannot be appealed once paid. So because of the illiteracy of EuropCar and thieving ethics of them, I am left with a huge £163.60 charge. Already struggling in the current economics and then businesses like these steal from you. I have pictures to provide as well.
I contacted them more than 5 times. I have names to name as well.

Update: I have reported them to the Police.</div>

                <div class='text'>Hamilton Branch. Absolute scumbags. Lied on my paperwork and said I refused to sign. Then been hit with invoices I have refused to pay and now threatened with legal fees.

I have not started legal proceedings against europcar for fraud and harassment. All for hiring a car.

Not worth the hassle. From reading reviews I can see that it's not the first time the Hamilton branch manager has lied and caused customer issues. This person should be sacked.

                <div class='text'>I accidentally booked with Europcar because somehow they were the first non-ad when I searched for Enterprise Rent-a-Car.
They asked me a lot of details and I jumped through the hoops with app and account etc.
On the day they sent me emails preparing me for my hire and I got to the counter they said they were refusing to hire it to me. No explanation, no extra details taken. Their system said no. I asked why they couldn’t have told me this when I booked it and they said it was their policy not to check eligibility until the customer turned up on the day. I travelled hours to get there and they left me no time to find an alternative. Fair enough if for some undisclosed reason you don’t want to rent it to me but this nonsense policy wasted a lot of my time and left me in a sketchy situation. And this could happen to anyone and you’ll never know till you get there</div>

                <div class='text'>I was offered an upgrade for £40, discounted from £80. Then told I was signing just to accept the extra £40 as I had already pre-paid the rental in full. Do insist on checking through your paperwork as I later discovered I had been charged £40 per day- £570. Europcar won’t do anything, insisting it is my word against theirs even though I pointed out that logically why would I complain near the start of my rental and why would I triple my costs on a whim? Do not trust the sales agents at Gatwick airport. If you must use this company do not accept any extras at pick- up.</div>

I sent numerous emails to Europcar customer services UK supplying clear proof of their error. After wasting hours on many detailed emails, Europcar still refused to refund our €79 fee. Europcar 'customer services' clearly exist as a barrier to refuse customer refunds and prevent case resolution. I successfully had a full refund from Mastercard after sending evidence for processing a chargeback against Europcar. I wish I had done it much sooner. So process your credit card chargeback directly after any first refusal in writing ( use email ) from Europcar customer service. Customer services are absolute time wasters. I will never use Europcar again.</div>

                <div class='text'>AWFUL FROM START TO FINISH.

I hired a van for the day, on a Saturday, to help a family member move house. I paid nearly £80 for the pleasure, along with a £100 deposit and £36 insurance upgrade. The collection process was simple and straight forward, and the bloke who helped me was nice. However, I was told I would need to leave the van in a nearby carpark when I was done with it, as there was no where else to leave it out of hours, but that it would be picked up at 1pm on the Sunday (the following day). Fair enough, although it would have been useful to know this upon booking. I dropped the van off 3 hours before my rental period ended at 7pm on the Saturday, and paid for the parking until the next day (as advised by the staff member) for 12 hours at nearly £8. I received a return statement and invoice on the Monday to say that I was being charged an additional £114.45 as I didn’t hand the car back until the Monday! I contacted customer via phone and email, and sent proof of my drop off, the carpark receipt and all additional info I had to and they essentially fobbed me off and told me it was my fault and that I had indeed dropped the car off on the Monday. They explicitly said I had been charged correctly. They then stopped replying to my emails. I phoned the branch where I hired the van from and they accepted that they had wrongly charged me BUT it took almost 4 weeks to get my money back, and in total I spoke to 6 different people who were useless at helping me. I kept being told ‘it should be with you soon, call back in 2 days’. Overall, a horrific service and unless you push and press them, they are reluctant to accept fault and refund you. I didn’t get one apology during this experience. DO NOT USE THEM.</div>

                <div class='text'>Our car was damaged on the Friday and the insurance put, us in touch with Europcar for a hire car until the car was repaired the following Monday. We were told they would contact us to take the £1 deposit and get us a car. We heard nothing from them. We made several calls to organise a car but, never got a car or even a call back from them. When we were told our car may not be repaired by then end of Monday, we contacted Europcar again and they told us they would deliver a car to us by 5pm. The car never arrived. Luckily our car was repaired by 2pm. We did not cancel the hire car. It just never turned up and Europcar haven't even bothered to contact us. We called them to make a complaint and they gave a number to call to make a complaint. We called that number and the woman was quite snotty and would not take the complaint.</div>

                <div class='text'>Update: it is funny how quickly you get a reaction when you make a public complaint compared to zero response to several e-mails and filled forms like the one proposed in the reaction of Europcar. I will try once again but have no issues of getting a reply or solution from Europcar.

---

I booked the car through Easyjet and (in short) this happened at the Europacar desk in Gatwick:

- When picking up the car the person behind the desk tried to upsell. She had 2 keys, one of the MG which would be our car and another key of a car which would have navigation and heated seats. Normally for 100 pound extra, but now only for 40. We declined this and the MG had navigation and heated seats anyway. Seems like very dodgy practice.

- I had to sign a document, I asked what is was for,, the person said I was signing for the car not having any damage. She even joked it felt like “siding your life away”. The car didn’t have any damage but it seems she lied about what I was signing.

- After that I had to swipe my card. I asked if this was for the deposit. She said, yes this is for deposit, this again seems like a blatend lie as my creditcard was charged anyway after returning the car.

Getting a reply from the client service department is a real nightmare. I have send about 6 e-mails (one every week) to get a reply of 2 sentences by someone who clearly didn't care to read buy e-mails or check my case. Renting with Europcar has been an absolute disaster and I wil never do so again.

I have bookked many cars with other rental companies all around the world and I never had any problems. Of course I wouldn't recommend anybody to book with Europcar.</div>

                <div class='text'>Beware of GLASGOW AIRPORT Europcar branch

One of the worst experiences of my life.
From the moment you enter their office, strong pressure to take a more expensive car, tricky games with additional services, scaring you with penalties etc.
When you repeatedly refuse to pay for something you don't need, the document combinations begin (folding signed documents in half, adding additional documents by hand, manual addition of services).
At the end, we were charged a deposit (which is normal and understood) but when returning the vehicle we were told that this was not a deposit but additional services and they won't pay us back !!!

Now think about, how you want to call it (#@$%), and whether you want to do deal with such people and such a company?!</div>

                <div class='text'>ok, I knew this is a waste of time, but I called customer service again, and I talked to Leo (Ipad) again. What are the odds?
At least this time he was honest and told me that there's nothing I can do and they reached out to me on trust pilot just so they look that they are trying.
Big surprise there...
Wow, this company is rotten to the core.

On April 10th we flew to Heathrow, and we took a shuttle to Europcar to pick up the car we already paid for online.
The guy at the desk started to push a free upgrade, a Mercedes GLE SUV. I said I don’t want it because it is an expensive car, but he insisted, saying that the car is not new and has scratches.
Eventually we agreed and he said there’s a deposit of 284 GBP that will be refunded when we return the car.
That’s when he realized that my wife’s driver’s license is expired, but because he was eager to scam us he finished the papers making her the main driver which should be not only against their policies but also illegal. Of course she didn’t drive at all, I was doing all the driving.
I signed the papers and then he said that because it is a free upgrade a manager will have to sign.
The manager came and he signed then we left. What I didn’t realize was that the manage added a 4 in front of 284 making it 4284 GBP.
Also, we didn’t realize until later that they didn’t take any deposit from the visa (for the obvious reasons).

When we returned the car, we noticed the amount on the back, and we asked to speak to the manager (a different one).
He was right in front of us, but we had to wait about 20 minutes because he was trying to push an upgrade to a family.
Eventually we talked to him and he said that it is our fault for signing and he pretty much called me stupid.
We tried to lock the Visa, but it was too late.

We returned to Canada and immediately called Europcar customer Service and talked to Agostina.
I explained the situation including the expired license. She gave us a case number and said she will e-mail us with a resolution.
After couple of hours we got and e-mail for her saying that our request was respectfully denied.
I called again and talked to Leo. I explained to him the situation again, stressing the fact that the contract should be void because
it was issued knowing that the main driver’s license is expired. He agreed and said that maybe Agostina overlooked that aspect.
He gave me a new case number and said he will e-mail us within a day.
The next day we got the e-mail, and he respectfully denied the refund saying “even in the case Mrs Bogatan would not have a
Valid driving license she would remain the legal hirer as it is her who signed the agreement and paid”. That is incorrect
because it was me who signed and paid the agreement.

At no point in our conversation Leo or Agostina seemed surprised that someone would spend 4284 GBP on an upgrade
for a rental that costed about 350 GBP which makes it obvious that everybody there is part of a big happy bunch f scammers that is Europcar.
We checked online and there is an overwhelming number of negative reviews, lots of them describing situations similar to ours.
I guess I should consider myself lucky for not damaging the car, because apparently that is Europcar’s main way to overcharge customers.

The question is how can big company like this openly rob so may customers without any actions from the authorities?

                <div class='text'>I have used Europcar for several years and never had a problem (renting around 8weeks per year) however my last trip to Bordeaux was appalling

My flight was moved and I contacted the helpline to inform them - on arrival they had no record of the call and had issued my car to someone else.

I was then given an old beat up dirty black 4x4 which had marks dents and scratches everywhere - inside and out.

The member of staff laughed about the condition of the vehicle , but time pressing I went with the flow

On returning I’ve been charged €700 for a ridiculous scuff on a door - there is no way that it could have been seen prior and the member of staff rubbed the door so much that they inflicted the majority of the damage whilst I stood there.

                <div class='text'>Watch out for this Europcar scam.
I hired a car in Thailand was NOT the car I paid for and had 130,000 miles on it with as you can imagine quite a bit of damage. However that’s not the worst Eurocar scam to look out for. I have just had money taken out of my account almost 2 months after the hire for an undisclosed reason , my communications and phone calls resulted in them basically telling me it’s not their problem and for me to deal with it so Europcar are saying it’s not Europcars problem you need to speak to Europcar. A total scam and absolutely not willing to help anyone resolve the issue so likely an orchestrated and common occurrence. Best approach would be to not use them and be careful with other car rentals .

                <div class='text'>Avoid Europcar unless you want to be stitched up after doing the right thing.

I hired a car from Europcar Inverness and reported unlisted damage on the same day I collected the vehicle, within their 24-hour grace period. I physically went to their return hut, pointed out the damage to a staff member, and was told it “didn’t matter” because it didn’t affect the paintwork. No paperwork was amended, and I followed their instructions in good faith.

Weeks later, I’m being charged for that exact damage — the one I clearly reported. Europcar now claims there’s no record of my report, despite it being made in person, and is proceeding with the damage charge anyway.

This feels like a scam, plain and simple. They ignore attempts to follow their own procedures, then turn around and pin the blame on the customer. Disgraceful behaviour from a company that clearly puts profit over honesty.</div>

                <div class='text'>Absolutely atrocious service...
I arranged and pre paid for a van hire for 1 day, arrived at the depot at the agreed time all relevant documents and credit card ( in my name ) only to be told they can't hire to me as their system isn't able to identify me at my address ( a soft credit search )
I have hire vehicles from numerous agencies all over the world and have never had this experience.
The don't appreciate or care how this will effect the clients reasons for hire.
While I appreciate there are always two sides to a story and people only write their version of events but this is actually how i was treated. I appreciate they have to protect their assets but surely a better systems should be in place i this day and age.
Never rent from them.</div>

The worst experience I have ever had,
Please Avoid at all costs. Europcar falsely claim for 100 0 GBP for scratches they were there upon I picked the car. However I have gathered evidences like photos and videos of the vehicle upon pickup and return.
But Europcar still mad their fraudulent claim and charges. There are really stressing me out, also harassing, intimidating me by their Emails and phone calls. For the time being am looking for solicitors firm eligible for a lawsuit.</div>

I have spent two days trying to have a car collected as part of the hire arrangement and despite multiple phone calls to the central office as despite trying multiple times there is no answer from the Preston branch
Europcar arrive at my property today and walk past their car and post a letter advising the vehicle is now overdue if they had bothered to knock on my door they could of taken the car
we unfortunately cannot return the car to them as we are no longer insured to drive it and not one person within the company will help so totally at loss with nowhere to turn the stress is horrendous and I would NOT recommend this company to anyone</div>

                <div class='text'>I hired a car from Europ rip off car for 1 week. I had paid for a full tank of feul in advance with the idea being that what you don't use you get refunded for. I paid £80 and only used about £25 at best. This bunch of thieves then charged me the whole £80 and refused a refund. If possible avoid these thieving vermin and go for a much better car rental company. Which would be every other car rental company in the world.</div>

                <div class='text'>I have been hiring a car for a month with various returns to the branch to extend / return & rehire.

I was charged a late fee when I was not late (£54) to then be charged a further £316 from my bank without authorisation when I queried the late charge!

My £250 deposit has not been returned yet customer services are ignoring all questions with regards to my deposit.

Europcar currently have £621.18 of my money with no care that I have a family to feed and bills to pay. They are currently telling me they are going to refund me £146.83 which is nowhere near the amount they have stolen from me.

One mess up on their end has caused a whole string of problems.

I have no idea why they thinks it’s acceptable to just take money from accounts for absolutely no reason. I currently still have the hire car but I will not be hiring again after this.</div>

                <div class='text'>Hirer beware!
Make sure that you take photos/videos of the car when you pick it up.Unfortunately I didn’t before leaving Knock Airport.
When I returned the car after 3 days low mileage trips in Mayo the person inspecting the car drew my attention to a mark on the alloy wheel.Despite my assurance that I had not had any accidents with the car she had to report the 2” mark. I assumed that I would hear no more about it but on my next credit card statement I discovered that without any notification they had deducted €391 to cover the cost of repair. My insurance company asked me to submit an invoice for the repair but Europcar admitted that the wheel would probably not be repaired and that €391 was an estimated cost! WhenI showed a photo of the damage to my local body repairers in Rochdale they estimated €70 as a true cost. Europcar Knock will never again get my custom and I return to Ireland every summer.</div>

                <div class='text'>When I hired the car at Carcasonne airport there were no apparent scratches. There was some road dirt on the car when I returned it , due to normal usage. When I returned the car they rubbed the road dirt off the car at two small isolated spots , and pointed to some hardly noticeable marks which I must have missed when I took the car ( as they were extremely difficult to see, even when they were pointed at ) They said I caused them, but I 100% did not as I am ultra ultra careful with my cars , including where I park etc at all times . The minor scratches could have been rubbed out with T cut in 10 minutes, but they have charged me £480 . Firstly I don’t believe I caused the scratches, secondly how did they just go straight to them under the road dirt on just those two isolated locations, thirdly what garage charges such high costs for a T cut type repair. I have hired cars for 50 years and never had any damage, and believe I didn’t on this occasion either. I believe Europcar have some vested interests in inventing these situations, and consequently will never use them again .</div>

                <div class='text'>Avoid this company at all costs!

Please avoid using this company particularly the Gatwick Airport Branch. We ordered a car online and when we arrived the car wasn't available which is standard but what I wasn't made aware of was the replacement car was an upgrade that I'd have to pay for. The agent didn't make me aware of the extra cost and got me to sign everything with no explanation and I felt under pressure to do so. Its as if the agents have a target and are paid commission to up sale. Pity I didn't read the reviews before booking this company, hopefully someone reads this and doesn't make the same mistake and goes with some other car hire company!</div>

                <div class='text'>I called to arrange collection of my hire car and was told that it would be collected between 2pm and 6pm. I waited in all afternoon but no-one turned up, there was no phonecall or communication to advise that they weren't coming or running late. Just before 6pm I called to check if they were coming. The gentleman I spoke to, refused to help me and said that I would need to call the branch. I then called the branch - they were closed! I then called back and spoke to an extremely rude and abusive lady. She refused to help me, refused to put me through to a manager, kept talking over me and hung up when I asked for her name. Her attitude, lack of customer care and rudeness has left me extremely upset. I cannot understand how someone with her attitude and unkindness can work in customer service.</div>

                <div class='text'>I hired a large van to move some items all in all around 30miles. I needed it on a Saturday and this was the only company with availability. I booked it on the Thursday beforehand. Booked the van from 10:00am-22:00pm on Saturday and was charged £71.45 which I thought was fairly reasonable. Noticed when booking that a charge would be added after as I would be returning the van out of hours. I called Europcar to ask how much this charge would be and was told £20. I asked for this info to be emailed to me in case they tried to charge more later. They said they couldn't provide this info in writing which made me nervous but I needed to go ahead with the booking. The next day (Friday) I had a phone call from them saying that the van I had booked was not available but they could offer me a smaller one. I declined as had to move a sofa. They said it was OK and they would make sure the van was available for my booking the next day. Saturday we arrived at Europcar at 10am but there was nowhere to park at all - it was a tiny site with cars/vans everywhere. I ended up dropping off my partner and parking at the shop down the street. He was waiting for about 15 minutes till he got served and was told the van wasn't ready. He had already checked in online but they wanted all of his details again. Clearly they needed to waste time as the van wasn't ready. They asked for the payment card so I had to go back and provide this, they made a comment to my partner saying something along the lines of 'we will cancel this whole thing off until she gets here and then start again' - my partner said 'no that is not necessary she is parked 30 seconds away - keep it on the screen she will be here now'. I arrived and they took all of my details and tried to sell me insurance. I said that the basic will be fine as we are travelling very local. They proceeded to try and scaremonger me into taking the insurance but I said no. At this point it was about 11am and they were cleaning the van. I said that I want a discount as the van wasn't ready 1 hour after my booking time. They said as a gesture of goodwill that I could have the van until the following day. I said this is no use to me, I am doing 1 trip - I want you to waive the £20 key drop-off out of hours fee and they said they would 'try'. So far, I haven't been charged this but wouldn't be surprised if it comes out of my account in the next few days. Would not recommend at all. Problem at every stage. Should have read reviews before booking. Even if you're in dire need I would go elsewhere.</div>

                <div class='text'>Arrived ~45 minutes before the reservation time. Approached the counter, asked if there were any issues and was assured by James that this isn't a problem - that there won't be any additional charges for the early pick up, and the original reservation will hold (i.e. able to return at the original time without incurring any late fees as well).

I had added on the fuel option and was told that there'd be a hold on my card for excess fees, which will be returned. Went through the contract quickly, and James only pointed out the additional fuel option and got me to sign. BIG MISTAKE. I should've noticed that the contract now showed an additional day's rental charged at a ridiculously high rate, along with associated fees.

For context, my original booking was a compact sedan over 3 days, and the spot rate charged for what was essentially a 45-minute early pick up was £100 (40% of my initial cost). Might I add that due to the hard selling, we only received the key to the car 20 minutes before the original pick up time.

After returning the car, I wasn't provided a statement of return nor a final invoice, despite them responding to confirm that it would be sent over in the next 10-20 minutes. When I saw the absurd charges to my card a few days later, Europcar representatives informed me that the dispute was filed, but again, they never got back with a case number and went radio silent after.

Despite 2 follow-up emails, sharing the intention to file for a chargeback based on fraud, Europcar refused to respond. Filed for a dispute with my bank, took months and multiple emails before I finally got my money back.

Save your time and wallet, pay the extra and go with more reputable car rental firms in Bristol.</div>

                <div class='text'>Wow if only I had a look at reviews before hiring a van to move house with europcar, shoddy across the board. We paid for a LUTON van to move house, a week before they phoned to say it wasn’t available and we’d need to downsize but that the capacity was similar. Begrudgingly we said yes. They then phone to say we need to repay for the hire of that van?! Despite already having 170£ for the original hire (assured this will be refunded within 10 days), we then pay out AGAIN for a second van. You guessed it the day before completion they phoned to say we don’t have that van now, unless we want to wait until 5pm?! Erm no. So we downsize yet again to what can only be described as a large car, we refuse to pay again but are then asked to pay a whopping deposit despite them already having 2x van payments from us. The customer service was beyond shocking, people have the communication skills of a wet lettuce, and that’s putting it nicely. You ask at the desk and are met with blank faces and “we don’t know how to do that”. Honestly shocking from start to finish and 300£ lighter.</div>

                <div class='text'>Terrible, avoid! Returned a car to discover it had a crack in the windscreen. No point of impact so was obviously caused by the cold weather which is common in weakly manufactured screens. Sure enough searching the car make and cracked windscreen shows other drivers had this problem. Despite there being no impact damage, no surrounding scratches etc just a clean crack they are insisting its damage not a defect. They are asking for £900. I did take out insurance elsewhere but they wont cover manufacturing defects. Complete lack of care from them means I wont be using them in the future.</div>

                <div class='text'>This company fraudulent removes money and makes it difficult to claim it back so people give up on claiming. I am currently applying for a court date with small claims and have reported this company to trading standards. 
On the 15th Feb you charged me for a car you refused to rent me because your new employee didn't know how to read Spanish driving licences and his superiors refused to help him read it. Renting from another company meant additional charges. I wrote to you on the 15th Feb asking for a contact in you legal team as I was going to put forward a case for you to pay for the additional costs. You refunded the original charge about 40 days later. 
On the 20th Feb you charged me £102 as a penalty for not turning up to collect the car! I obviously disputed this and was told you had sent instructions to Gatwick South Europcar to refund this. It has not been refunded at this point and I am incurring interest payments due to the incompetence of your company in leveling this charge and then not refunding it in a timely fashion.
I wrote 3 weeks ago saying I expected compensation given the 20+ times I have explained this, your failure to refund, the additional costs incurred to hire a car from another company and my time and effort. two weeks ago I received a message that you were investigating and would get back to me. Today 6th April, I received an email saying the case is closed because you had refunded the original £135.18 charge. 
Please1/ cancel the £102 charge for the fine for "not turning up"2/ respond to the request for compensation via a legally trained representative with an email address so I don't have to wait 14 days for every failed response from "customer service".
I am posting this email daily to every review site for every branch of europcar until I have received the two above items

I have emailed that address over 20 times. I have started this in this copy of my latest email. This is exactly what has happened everytime. You don't read them message and send a copy and pasted response. I email again and 10 days later you send another copy and pasted response.</div>

                <div class='text'>If I could give 0 stars I would. I hired a car 4 months ago and was overcharged by over £400. Before booking the car I was assured by two Europcar employees what the price was and was promised that the extra number on the paper was my deposit that I would get back. They then took the extra money out of my account and when I raised this with Customer Care they said they would speak to the Park Royal branch I rented the car from, but they never did - just fobbed me off with an email saying the case was being dismissed. I then had to go back to the branch and speak to them in person. It took 3 months of my life to finally get the money back only to then receive an email from Europcar's lawyers fining me for not paying a bill that I had in fact already paid. They also charged me for a full tank of petrol when I returned the car despite the fact that I returned it full. It seems that Europcar took money from me at every chance they had. If I hadn't spent the time sorting this I would be several hundreds of pounds out of pocket. This has caused me so much stress! What a nightmare company to deal with.</div>

                <div class='text'>If I could give no stars I would absolutely rip off paid over £200 to hire a car paid up front. I did all my ID checking on line. Travelled 45 mins to get there to be told that they couldn’t hire me the car.
No explanation or reason given all this in front of other customers so made to feel really embarrassed.
Now I have to wait for my money as a refund which now means I can’t hire a car from somewhere else which means I now have to cancel my holiday as I can’t get there as no other hire car services are open.

I would not recommend this company. If you do use don’t pay upfront.
I was told by a customer outside that they were fully booked with reservations and so had to cancel 8 bookings so obviously overbooked and therefore making excuse to customers.

                <div class='text'>Worst experience of my life.

I didn't take out additional insurance, and I returned my car to bristol airport after a flawless drive and signed off on the tablet to confirm that all was fine. The staff at the car return looked over the car and didn't raise any issue. I then received a damage notification followed by a £100 bill for a 'light scuff' on one wheel, (which wasn't caused by me). I was shown no proof that this was not there before my rental and as much as I did check the car for dents/scrapes on the doors, bumpers etc (Bearing in mind it was dark at almost 11pm at night when I collected the car), I did not get down on my hands and knees with a torch to check the car tyres, if I had done I would have seen that this 'light scuff' was already there. At the time of returning the car I signed the tablet with no mention of any damage by staff even after they had walked around and inspected the car.
I contacted customer services and was simply told that 'any damage needed to have been reported before hand'. Will never use this company again and strongly advise others to avoid as I feel I have been victimised and ripped off for failing to take out additional insurance.</div>

                <div class='text'>Further to my complaint - I got an email asking me to contact Europcar, they don't give you an email - it has to be done via their site. So I dutifully tried to upload my email but gave up after numerous attempts - each time having to enter all my personal details etc. I keep getting a site error message from Europcar. So email is out. They make it so hard to get a phone number and my day is now whitling away with more time wasted on this company. I do not believe they care or are invested in their complaints procedure. I did try to give them a chance to follow up.

You couldn't make it up! They have emailed back again as a response to my second review and directed me to do the same thing! I think it’s an automated response, not a person.

I'm still waiting to see what DiscoverCars says - they sent an email and I have emailed them - at least they gave me an email adress.</div>

                <div class='text'>Your service is appalling. I paid a deposit 2 months before arriving for car hire in New Zealand. When I arrived I was told that I was on a watchlist in the uk and couldn’t hire the car, after a 26 hour flight. I was in disbelief as I’d never hired a car off of you. I asked the desk colleague to investigate who said there was nothing he could do as it was a uk issue. I then had to hire a different car which wasn’t fit for purpose from another company, I needed a truck one way from Nelson to Queenstown as was moving Items.I then had to stay up till it was 9am back in the uk (10pm nz time) to sort out myself, jet lagged as hell. You then admitted it was your mistake and I could now go and pick up the truck, I drove back 2 hours to the airport to swap the cars. I’d had to pay for a full weeks hire of the car I didn’t need and the other car company wouldn’t refund me, I’d need to obtain a refund from Europcar for the £700 I was now out of pocket. I then sent an email to the relevant department after speaking to one of your call centres and you replied saying I’m still blocklisted and you can’t issue a refund! I then have tried calling 4 times to your call centres (in India not the UK) who when I ask to speak to a manger to escalate have hung up on me 4 times. I’ve never experienced such poor customer service. All I wanted initially was my refund for the car I had to hire because of your ineptitude, however I will now be taking you to small claims court and claiming for the car, my time, and the stress you have caused me, along with the interest on the money you owe me. DO NOT hire from this company, they are absolutely useless, the departments don’t speak to each other and no one in any department has the authority to make a decision when something goes wrong, I suspect the staff don’t get paid well enough to care about their jobs or to provide any worthwhile level of service. I look forward to taking them to court to expose their level of incompetence.</div>

                <div class='text'>Booked a medium size van nine days ago to pick up the Tamworth Branch. Received a confirmation at the time and another confirmation yesterday saying that I would be collecting a medium size van.
Today (less than 20 hours before my planned pick-up) I get a call from Tamworth to say that someone has extended their hire so a medium van is not available.I'm offered a large van which is not suitable for the road that I will be driving down. Apparently there is no other medium van available.
I phone customer services and ask to be put through to the complaints department but all they can do is log that I have complained. They can't sort it out. So they transfer me back to customer services who explain to me that when you book via the website and even though you receive 2 emails confirming your booking, it doesn't mean that the booking is actually confirmied. It is just noting what you would like. All they can suggest is that I try to book a van from another location. I suggest that if there is a van at another location, it could be delivered to Tamworth for tomorrow. Apparently that can't be done. They did offer to cancel my booking free of charge but that doesn't help me with my need for a medium size van in 20 hours time.
In the end they suggest that I ring Tamworth and ask them to sort it out, which obviously Tamworth can't do because otherwise they wouldn't have rung me in the first place.
UPDATE
As readers can see I got a response from Europcar some time between 5-6.00pm so I followed their instructions and tried to email them with further information. The email failed due to a problem their end - probably closed for the night.</div>

                <div class='text'>BEWARE!!!! These guys are a broker or third party so sell you insurance, but it's a claim back policy (?!). I thought I was getting it all through Europcar. However, Europcar tried to upsell me their insurance - even though when you do manage to read through DiscoverCars policy - it says you are covered. But Europcar then ask you to fully cover the car with a credit card - in my case, 1800Euros which if you don't have a credit card it's more on a debit card- around another 25euros a day. It was exhausting - the operative at Europcar also said she had never heard of DiscoverCars - even though the bus was outside with both their logos on and if you Google them - they say they are partners! I ended up having to get a cab. The whole thing exhausting and leaves you feeling like fresh meat to be plundered!</div>

                <div class='text'>After getting a vehicle from Europcar I returned it the day after because my vehicle was fixed, I did around 10 miles in the hire vehicle but went to a fuel station to top it up and was surprised when it took nearly £15 of petrol.
When you hire a vehicle from Europcar you have to give them your card details so they can fill the vehicle up if the vehicle is returned empty, the fuel gauge on the hire vehicle was reading full before I topped it up so how come it took nearly £15 of petrol.
Unfortunately I also pick up a parking fine ( it was my fault ) but this company paid the fine of £40 plus a £33.56 administrative charge without sending me the fine so I could appeal the fine because I have a blue badge and that was in my vehicle that had broken down.
This company has since then hounded me for the sum of £73.56 which I have paid and are still sending me debt letters. I have done a load of phone calls to this company regarding this matter at lo and behold they can’t find me on there system
I have finally resolved this issue but through Motability who lease my vehicle to me and the fine has been paid but no response from Europcar. Avoid this company like the plague</div>

                <div class='text'>This company has been a big letdown. I picked up a car and was given a vehicle with no real alternatives. The vehicle stank of cigarettes. This is despite there being a big sign in the car and a written policy of no smoking in the cars. I had to accept the vehicle given the lack of alternatives and the need to be on my way quickly but mentioned it on return and it was treated as a non complaint. A totally couldn’t care a less attitude. I then complained to the company in writing and they didn’t even acknowledge the complaint. I wrote to them about an unexpected charge along with the smell complaint and they acted like I hadn’t even mentioned the smell aspect. They also wrote off my complaint about the unexpected charge. Despite repeated attempts to have the smell aspect acknowledged they refused and pointed me to an industry complaints organisation. Ridiculous and disgraceful as well as lazy not only in valeting the vehicle but in the sense of not dealing with a normal complaint and instead forcing the customer to deal with a different body. This displays traits that show this company has no desire towards customer service, is willing to pass on substandard vehicles and charge for the privilege. My advise, go elsewhere. Anywhere else.</div>

                <div class='text'>Really disappointing experience – won’t use Europcar again

We hired a car from Europcar after ours was taken off the road due to an accident. During the hire, the car developed a tyre issue and we had to wait a long time for it to be repaired, leaving us unable to use the vehicle for a period of time.

We also spent far too long on the phone to customer service, who gave different information and weren’t particularly helpful throughout.

At the end of the month-long hire, we were charged £201 for a valet – due to dust, gravel in the footwells (it was winter). The rest of the car was spotless, and even one of their own advisors agreed the charge seemed excessive. To top it off, it took 4 months for them to tell us the price they wanted to charge.

I’ve used plenty of other car hire companies without issue – this was by far the most frustrating experience. I won’t be using Europcar ever again.</div>

                <div class='text'>The Agent was very skilled at distracting you while he added extras that he said were free but in fact added hundreds of pounds to the rental. He then keeps you focussed on one part of the contract while getting your signatures on the other parts. This cost me hundreds of pounds. I was cheated but the lesson is to make sure they explain every cost and every aspect of the contract even if there is a queue behind you. Don’t let them rush you. I turned around when leaving to see the Agent high fiving their Manager. So they are very brazen about ripping off customers. I formally complained about the actions of the Agent, accepting it was my fault not to check everything. But the attitude of Complaints matched the attitude of the Agent.</div>

                <div class='text'>I was constantly advised against using Europcar by others who had bad experiences with them. I recently went to Gatwick Airport to hire a car for the weekend, and the price of £408 for just two days has completely turned me off from this company for life. This experience has become a topic of conversation among my colleagues, friends, and family. I'm sorry, Europcar, but your time in the market is up; this situation is outrageous!

It seems like either the employees are making money on the side for their personal gain, or the company is poorly managed. Their advertisement claims that you can hire a car from £40 per day, but when I inquired, they were quoting me £200 per day instead! This feels like false advertising, and they are clearly breaking laws left and right.

Advisory is if they mess up the best thing is to open a complaint and conduct an ADR process, wait for their final response, and then to Financial Ombudsman Services, which is a free service. Once you have a ruling in your favor, this is the key for charges to be added. One colleague was ready to sue this firm for £8,000 when initially Europcar only owed £2,500 for falsely extorting monies for their personal gain, which is fraud under the 2006 Act. They had to pay very quickly; otherwise, their stock of cars would go to auction with more costs to them! And then see them in court with your decision from the FOS and then send in bailiffs to collect your debt! Easy way but will take time. Theur customer services are incompetent to deal with complaints so court is the best action.</div>

                <div class='text'>I have used Europcar several times and never had any problems with them, until the rental car I had last summer was damaged by a third party. This third party admitted responsibility and I filed a damage report following Europcars instructions. They had all the details of the driver causing the damage and I assumed that was the end of the issue. However, sometime later I received a claim for payment of the damage from Europcar. I explained the situation but they had no record of my damage report. The alarm bells should have started ringing then. I had to pay the 850 pounds damages, while they claimed the money from the driver responsible and I have still not been refunded some 8 months later. I have been passed from department to department, emailing on average once a month to try and resolve the issue. The driver that caused the damage has told me his insurance company case number and as far as he is concerned the matter is closed and his insurance has paid, but I have not received any money. I will continue to email Europcar, but I am wondering if I will ever get my money back. The only thing I am sure of, is that I will definitely think twice before renting with them again!

Guess what? I contacted customer services and according to them the case was closed!! I have been instructed to email them again. Feel like I am banging my head against a brick wall!!!</div>

I was dropped a car off with the petrol at 3 and a half bars, when I returned the car I gave it back at 3 and a half bars with the range showing more than i was given the car at, i was told I was given the car at full tank therefore was charged an extra £35. I emailed them but they refused to reimburse me. I have spoken to another person who had the same issue. Poor business conduct.

                <div class='text'>I paid for a car rental online, when I got there I was told they need to do a soft credit check. Mind you I’ve rented cars for over 20 years and I’ve never come across a car rental company that does a soft credit check. They said it was declined and I don’t know why.

The reason I’m so annoyed is that they don’t make this clear on their website, if it was, I wouldn’t have bothered, since to me, renting a car is no big deal. I’m paying in advance so a soft credit check makes no sense. Also, I had to pay £40 in taxi fare, and now I’ve got to wait for the refund to go back on my card.

I do not recommend this car rental service. A total waste of time and money!</div>

                <div class='text'>Don't use at all. Booked online had a specific time delivery, spent 5 hrs on calls trying to find out what was happening. Well past agreed time for the car.

Requested a full refund due to failure to deliver within agreed time and no information of when could be expected. Spoke to so many people over the 5 hrs including customer services 4/5 times. On hold for over 1hr of the 5hrs. They couldn't even reach the local office for an update.

They cant actually refund you as its against policy. You have to cancel (even when it's their error) at a cost of £45.00 and then make a claim back against them for a cancelation fee. No idea how long that will take. Would have scored minus if option was available.</div>

                <div class='text'>Appalling service, my daughter mobility car broke down on 24th March 2025 in which she required a courtesy car. Mobility use Europcar for their courtesy cars. On Monday 24th March I received a phone call from europcar asking for a deposit and then told me a car would be delivered that evening between 4-5pm, at 6pm I phoned them to ask where it was to be told that it would be delivered the following day between 10-11am (therefore we had to travel via a taxi to and from my daughters day service which is 100mile round trip per day) anyway I went with my daughter in the taxi to drop her off to her day service then I was dropped home to await the car being delivered. 12pm came so I phoned them to ask if it was still being delivered and was told that the time had been pushed to 1pm and someone should have phoned me to let me know (I didn’t receive a call) I then waited till 2pm and still no car, I once again phoned them to ask where the car was because if it wasn’t going to arrive in time I would need to get another taxi so I could collect my daughter, I also asked to make a formal complaint because I had been told several different days and times and they hadn’t stuck to their agreement nor contacted me with any updates. I phoned back again half an hour later to ask if a complaint had been logged and I was told the previous person had spoken hadn’t put anything in the system. I asked again to file a complaint (which I’m not sure if they have or not) the car eventually arrived at 16:45 (24hrs later after the original planned time) there were no apologies or explanations given. It seems that there’s a miscommunication issue between (Europcar motability and Europcar Maidstone. I had already had a stressful day on Monday when the brand new (three months old) electric car came to a halt and the Electric Traction battery failed, leaving myself and my disabled daughter sitting at the side of the road for five hours awaiting RAC and tow truck (8 hour before car was recovered) so I really didn’t need their stress on top of it all</div>

                <div class='text'>I had an absolutely terrible experience with Europcar, particularly with their insurance, claims, and customer service departments. They were consistently unhelpful, gave misleading information, and showed a complete lack of professionalism.

I was repeatedly told that documents would be sent by a certain date, only for them to fail to follow through. They say one thing and then do another, making the entire process frustrating and unnecessarily drawn out.

Their inability to provide accurate information and their poor communication made resolving the issue a nightmare. I would strongly advise avoiding Europcar for any car rental – the hassle just isn’t worth it.</div>

                <div class='text'>I booked a van in advance. I needed a specific internal load length and checked the vehicle dimensions. On arrival at Watford Europcar presented me with a short wheel base van that was not what I had booked. It was useless for my needs. They cancelled the rental agreement yet I am still waiting for my refund. I found them very unhelpful.</div>

                <div class='text'>Booked a van fairly easily online for a few hours to move some things into a house. Paid the full price as you’d expect. Completed an online check in and all going well. 24 hours later I receive an email to say I’ve failed a credit check?? I’ve already paid in full. Can’t get your money back until there process is complete to send the money back to you. It’s not like I’d need it to get another van from a normal company is it! Then another 24 hours later I receive another email saying I’m due to pick the vehicle up as planned. Which one is it?
These may be slightly cheaper but just go to a normal company and pay slightly more. It will save you the hassle</div>

                <div class='text'>Do not use Europcar in the uk, hired the car, took out additional cover which we were told at collection at Edinburgh airport, would cover any tyre damage. Have since been hounded by their collection for $300.00 to replace a tyre, I have provided the additional insurance cover document but have now been told, it doesn’t cover tyre, why else would I have taken out the additional cover. Previous when in the UK, I had a puncture when using Sixt and it was no problem and covered without any additional insurance. Now they have charged my credit card. I have never used Europcar before and will never again, my fault as I had heard of this happening to other travellers.</div>

                <div class='text'>Had the car for a week but on the first day one of the tyres dropped pressure so topped it up but it happened again 2 days later so called and they booked it in for a new tyre. Handed the car back and then a few days later was told I was liable for the tyre as I hadn’t reported the slow puncture within 24 hours of getting the car initially. At no point when I was sorting the new tyre did they say I was liable for a slow puncture and they have been totally unreasonable. They refused to complete a fault check on the car to show when the tyre pressure fault was initially recorded on the car and seem to think that a slow puncture would be obvious within 24 hours. If you ever are in the unfortunate position of having to deal with this awful company then accept they will screw you over and send you a bill for £180 for one tyre. I did the right thing and got the tyre changed even though I could easily have just pumped it up and handed it back to them and then they would have had to sort it which is what they did to me. No common sense and a an absolute rip off. Also told that this is classed as insurance claim, I hope the useless complaints person is wrong about this as it is totally ridiculous. Avoid this company unless you accept they will rip you off at any opportunity.</div>

                <div class='text'>If I could give less than 1 star I would. Europcar operate a 'scam' service.
I was flying from Australia to London Heathrow and decided to hire a car from Europcar during the Doha lay over. I selected the car to be picked up at the airport, filled in all the necessary and selected to pay upfront. The process went through up to my bank where it came back with 'there was an error with your bank' (Scam 1)

I found this odd as there were no issues. I tried a different credit card in case - same response. I tried calling Europcar, no answer. I decided to back myself up by selecting a 2nd rental from SIXT but to pay at the airport. Within seconds I received a SIXT confirmation of booking.

We arrived at Heathrow on Sunday 23rd March at around 5pm and decided to first go to Europcar as we had in the interim received an email stating 'YOUR CAR IS WAITING FOR YOU' (SCAM 2), and we had made a payment and if it had gone through whilst we were in flight, we didn't want to pay twice.
But we couldn't find Europcar. We asked SIXT desk and they said it is a shuttle SERVICE (Scam3). We went back to where the shuttle was supposed to be with 2 trolleys of suitcases. No signage. Went to ask again and told it is lane 3. Pushed the trolleys to lane 3 only to find it was not there. Asked again and directed me back to the first point. We waited 20m for a shuttle and a 20m drive to the EUROPCAR satellite office where there was another wait to be served of 15m. By this time it was now 8pm. I got to the front desk eventually, pulled up my email and the Europcar agent says 'you didn't finish your booking?'. I said I did and showed him the email stating 'your car is waiting'. He said that the booking was not confirmed, and the error message showed that. I asked why if the car wasn't available didn't they show this online and how was a customer to know that an error message for payment meant the vehicle wasn't available? He responded with that he could do the booking manually but there would be a price difference (Scam4). On the app it showed a 30GBP difference between online and at airport booking. We were tired and frustrated so said ok to the difference if it was small. We had booked an Electric JEEP for the week at a cost of 284GBP. The guy came back and said it was now 722GBP. I told him that was unacceptable. He said that due to the fire, all cars were booked out and no other rental company would have a car. It was now nearing 9pm, we had to be at a hotel 2hours drive from Heathrow and I think this is Europcar's plan (Scam 5). We refused to pay the price which was almost 3x that of the original booking and seeing we were not buying this scam, he said he could give a discount and we could get it for 520 GBP. The online at airport booking was 309GBP so he was trying his luck with the higher amounts. We refused and asked them to take us back to the airport.
On arrival I went directly to the SIXT desk, was helped by a fantastic and knowledgeable lady and within 10m we had the car which we had selected, at the price we selected. Europcar you could learn a lot from SIXT.
We are frequent travellers and will NEVER RENT FROM EUROPCAR again as they deliberately show cars online that they use to lure customers and then when the travellers are tired take advantage and try to scam by tripling the cost of the vehicle. You should be ashamed of yourself Europcar.</div>

                <div class='text'>This is the second time I've had the absolute nightmare in dealing with this two bit company.
Motability sorted out a hire car on Friday the 19th March 2025, a hybrid MG which was such a good, safe car that it was actually braking for me driving down the street, then low and behold a immediate warning light popped up. So I rang the AA and had a lovely non patronising mechanic come out, plug his machine in and said yeah you can't drive that. Even the machine doesn't know the error code which 9/10 is electrical fault so potential fire risk. Then they had the cheek to charge me £25.74 for fuel they used to deliver the car. The second MG they provided my husband was told my the gentleman to tell me that the car is 200horse power. What he doesn't realise is I'm very much a car female! Absolutely atrocious customer service and atrocious unsafe vehicles. Needs name changed to rent a wreck.</div>

                <div class='text'>I hired a car and put my son as the main driver on the online booking form.
When I got to the desk in Geneva airport to collect the car, I was told the main driver had to be the same as the person making the booking, as stated in their terms and conditions page 123 (even though the online form allows this), and they had to cancel the booking. I could rebook with another car ( at over twice the price).
No compromise was available.
Thanks Europecar for all the stress, time wasting and expense. Oh, and funny you haven’t fixed your online form.
Europecar’s reply to my review, suggested I contacted customer services which I duly did. After 5 days they responded saying they were unable to find my booking.
How convenient for them.</div>

                <div class='text'>After renting with enterprise for 4 weeks and experiencing nothing but absolutely stellar customer service and satisfaction. I was unfortunately introduced to Europcar “the uk’s number one mobility solution” (completely mind boggling that they are number one in anything remotely positive actually. The email that they sent me contained the wrong link and map to their current address which then meant I took an Uber to the wrong destination (provided by them) which meant I was Unable to collect my rental. I tried to get through to customer services (generic one as it was after hours) where again they were so unhelpful and impolite , not even considering that I could be frustrated or stressed due to their own incompetencies. I then woke up on Saturday and made my first call to customer services by 8:53am in an attempt to be put through to the Dartford branch…. This was actually impossible to do as the branch did not once answer their phone throughout the course of that morning , despite the customer service team supposedly emailing them about my issue. I then arrived at the branch after calling multiple times with no response , only to be greeted with “we don’t have any cars” erm… I hadn’t even had the opportunity to explain , to which I responded that I had been calling all morning and been instructed to come straight to the branch to which she huffed and started typing away on her monitor. I was then told I could only rent a small corsa like car though I had booked for a compact (slightly bigger) and when I asked if that would be deducted from the price I paid she responded “no it remains the same price”…. Slightly bizarre seeing as it’s two different sizes. I accepted as I was already at my wits end. 5 minutes passed and I was told that they would not be able to rent to me due to not passing a credit check….. surely the check should happen at the time of booking or even if that’s too difficult how about at the online check in stage which I had done already.

These conglomerates think they can do what they please to individual customers with no repercussions but believe me I am going to shout on every possible rooftop about this diabolical experience.</div>

                <div class='text'>I am writing to formally lodge a complaint regarding my recent experience with Europcar.

Booking and Payment Details
I booked my rental car at the same time as my easyJet flights. The total rental amount was £91.00, and an additional £50.00 was paid for waiver protection. (Supporting details attached.)

Initial Interaction at Rental Counter
Upon arrival to collect the car, the representative at the counter inquired whether I had rented with Europcar previously. I informed them that I had, but had a negative experience regarding fuel charges, despite refueling the car minutes before returning it. I was forced to raise a complaint and provide proof of my fuel purchase in order to receive a refund. The representative apologized and offered me a free upgrade for my current rental.

Rental Agreement and Holding Deposit
I was presented with the rental agreement, which clearly indicated the prepaid amount of £91.00, as well as an additional charge of £86.90, which was explained to me as a holding deposit. I questioned this charge, and it was reaffirmed as a holding deposit, which would be refunded to my card upon the return of the vehicle. This conversation was witnessed by my colleague, who was traveling with me at the time.

Fuel Refill and Return of Vehicle
Prior to returning the vehicle, I refueled the car with 6.91 liters of petrol, totalling £9.66, at the nearest garage to the airport (PA3 2TH), as per the attached receipt. Upon returning the vehicle, I handed the keys to a Europcar representative named Jack, who inspected the vehicle, including its mileage and fuel levels. He confirmed that everything was in order and that no issues were present.

Unjust Charges
On March 21, 2025, I received an invoice for additional charges, including a Premium Station Surcharge and a charge for 6 liters of fuel. Furthermore, my credit card has been charged an additional £98.85 on top of the original rental charge of £91.00.

These charges are clearly erroneous, unjustified, and appear to be fraudulent.

I hereby request that the excess charge of £98.85 be refunded immediately to my credit card.

Additionally, I wish to file a formal complaint against both the employee who processed my rental and the representative to whom I returned the vehicle. Their actions were misleading and resulted in fraudulent charges being placed against me.

I expect prompt resolution of this matter. Should this issue remain unresolved, I will be forced to take further action to protect my interests.</div>

                <div class='text'>Absolutely useless company.
Staff are incompentent and seem to be computer illiterate.
Not only did they take FIVE FULL days to arrange a replacement car for me, they had just over 2 weeks to prepare, it took me an hour to speak to someone to arrange collection of the car and only then do I find out the car I have, registration given to them, was NOT in my name, Obviously I don't know whose name it's in but the clown I spoke to didn't have it in my name.
Is this why I had to wait 5 days for a car? people can't hand their cars back in quick fashion.
Add to this a dodgy phone call I received regarding the accident the car was in, no not one of those run of the mill scam calls, this one had my name etc, I am now absolutely convinced that Europcar passed my details on to a crappy personal injury place.
Only 3 companies knew the car was in an incident and out of the 3 of them only one is the likely candidate.
Wouldn't use them if I had a choice.
Wish I could give them zero they don't deserve 1 star.

24/03/2025 this is my response to them replying to my review. I had already contacted your company and got a hollow worthless response from that, so no I won't be contacting you again. I've now had the car 2 days beyond me trying to return it and no idea if they'll actually coming today. I'd wager the depot that is supposed to collect it knows nothing about it as your customer service clowns are worthless and when I was on call it sounded like they were struggling to use their computers.
again, I will never use Europcar by choice.</div>

                <div class='text'>I hired a car from Inverness Airport on 18/3/25. I returned it a few hours later having done 42 miles and having filled the tank up to the very brim with £8 of fuel just before drop off. I couldn’t get any more fuel in the tank. They hold £250 from your account to cover any additional costs. Just got my money back but with £10 deducted for fuel! If true this car used £18 of fuel to cover 42 miles. This is a SCAM. I made the guy at the Europcar check the car over with me which was a bit of a walk. The guy was very unhappy, wanting me just to leave the car for him to check later, but came with me. He checked the car inside and out (checking mileage and fuel) and told me everything was OK and that I’d get my full deposit back ‘soon’. When you leave a hire car you are at the mercy of the integrity of these hire companies. Europcar clearly has little of that. I made a complaint and will include the result of that later. However it might be something like:

“Hello John,

                <div class='text'>I never write bad reviews but this company honestly deserve it. They are scammers and for an easy life get the bus! Upon return they tried to charge me £16 50 for fuel luckily I kept my receipts and took a pic of the dashboard with a full tank which had the date and time and they refunded me . The car STANK of smoke to the point where I drove it twice for the whole week as my kids were complaining of the smell and I had to keep windows open as a result I did call and complain about this. Then to make the 4 day experience even worse they then tried to tell me I damaged the wheel ! Again luckily using my iniative i took pictures before and after hire . These people must be seriously hard up for money as they will try to take anything they can. DO NOT USE THEIR SERVICE save yourself the stress</div>

                <div class='text'>13th March 15.35 received email confirmation of car hire from 17th-21st March pick up/drop off Kinston upon Thames.
14th March 13.05 received call from mobile 07815 464792 to inform me that the Kingston branch would not be operational w/c 17th March therefore pickup and drop off needed to change to another depot. It was agreed reluctantly on my part that new pickup/drop off station would be Gatwick South Terminal which is 30 miles from where i live. I was assured by the female caller that this modification would not alter the t&c's of the hire contract including the cost.
14th March 13.12 , the modification email came through which still stayed pickup and drop off Kingston upon Thames.
17th March 08.04, i rang europcar customer services to again ask for reassurance that this booking had indeed been modified correctly. I was assured that despite the modified booking stating Kingston upon Thames, the team at Gatwick would see this change on their system.
17th March 11.30 ,i embark on 2 and half hour journey on public transport at my own time and cost to travel to Gatwick.
17th March approx 14 00, approach service desk, i am.told there is no booking. Customer service agent calls over manager who also looked perplexed and repeated no such booking. I insist and relay the information provided by Kingston. After 5 mins of phone calls and deliberation Customer service agent, tells me that i have 3 different options of car, each costing £30+ per day additional to what i had already paid. I declined having been completely misinformed by Europcar and was told only alternative was a refund. I went outside and immediately called Europcar customer services who passed me back and forth and eventually to complaints. They refused to acknowledge their error and when i asked them to resolve the matter as they were at fault i was told that i would have to make a new reservation at a new cost £200+, but that i would have to wait at gatwick another 3 hours as their system did not allow immediate booking and vehicle retrieval. I have now travelled 30 miles from home on buses and trains to be told a) booking not valid b) i would have to pay another £120+ c) if i want new reservation i would have to wait 3 hours.
UNACCEPTABLE
While this has been now registered as a complaint and assures an investigation, i insist on satisfactory answers to the following:
Why was Kingston upon Thames showing as open and operational on Gatwick system which initially impeded the gatwick staff from seeing the booking?
Why, when a customer has already been subjected to a 30 mile trip instead of a 20 min bus ride to their chosen and confirmed place of pick up and drop off, at their own inconvenience, time and money, does Europcar not accept their own internal failures and endeavour to resolve the problem?

I will also be submitting a claim for compensation to cover travel expenses to the airport and the additional cost of hiring a vehicle with another provider who were extremely helpful in overcoming the ridiculous bureaucracy around 2/3 hour wait times for a vehicle when they had one available and ready to go. Needless to say i will not be using Europcar ever again.
I would appreciate a swift and satisfactory response addressing the abysmal customer service illustrated above

Blanket response from Europcar which failed to address the specific failings of the booking.

"Thank you for contacting Europcar Customer Services regarding the vehicle not provided for your reservation 1187068944.

Firstly, I would like to sincerely apologise for the lack of provision of the confirmed vehicle. On occasion, unforeseen changes to our fleet utilisation, resulting from extensions or breakdown can result in the Rental station responsible for your hire being unable to fulfil the booking.

I would like to sincerely apologise for any inconvenience that may have been caused, and would like to assure you we constantly review ways to improve our services and minimise any disruption to our customers.

I trust this information assists with your query.

Regards,



David"

                <div class='text'>I booked a rental car through EasyJet after booking my flight to Gatwick Airport.
I booked through Discovery Cars who apparently use a company called Keddy who are run by Europcar.
After quite a trek to find the rental cars at South Terminal it was there I discovered my car had been booked through Europcar.
Somehow during the process and my very stressed self having lost my passport lots of extras were added to my rental without telling me or advising me there as I signed the paperwork. Even when I questioned the girl about the extra £409 she said she didn’t know how much the rental was but there was a refundable deposit.
After returning the car £409 was taken from my bank account with no warning and it appears the £78 on my original booking was none existent thank to the added extras I was not told about.
When I rang to complain they laughed at me.
A very poor service and left me feeling I’d
been scammed.
I wish I had read the other reviews for Europcar as I would have seen so many other people have experienced the same situation. Do not use this company if you can help it!</div>

                <div class='text'>I bought a full tank and returned it as a full tank. As written on the return invoice, 8/8: 8/8
The next day's invoice showed a Fuel charge of £12.53 for 1.74 plus VAT for 6 litres.
However, I filled up the vehicle with BP 5 minutes before returning it, as I had driven 57 miles.(I have Bp invoice) I received 8/8 and returned 8/8 as approved and written by the person who received the vehicle. So they found a way to make easy money. A complete DISGRACE

                <div class='text'>🚨 WARNING: DISHONEST & UNFAIR PRACTICES AT EUROPCAR 🚨

I am a disabled customer who rented a vehicle from Europcar, and my experience has been absolutely appalling. I was wrongly charged for fuel and mileage discrepancies, and despite providing solid proof—including a photo with the exact date, time, and mileage when I dropped the car off—Europcar completely dismissed my evidence.

Their response was nothing short of deceitful. The mileage on the vehicle increased after it was picked up, yet they ignored my concerns and insisted on charging me unfairly. Instead of addressing my proof, they gave vague responses and refused to acknowledge their own mistakes.

This company is dishonest and has no regard for fairness or customer care, especially for disabled customers like myself. If they can do this to me, they can do it to anyone!

🚨 BEWARE! Take photos, record everything, and think twice before trusting Europcar with your money. 🚨</div>

                <div class='text'>We have been loyal Europcar customers for years. Myself and my partner rented a vehicle and mid-way through the trip, when we finally opened one of the back doors, a handle just came off and stayed in my hand. The inside of the door handle was also visibly covered in glue (guessing done by the previous renter), but I would have no way to prove this. We returned the car immediately to the dealership and the agent (which knew us as this point) have assured us that we would not be held liable and that they will report it as damage caused in the previous rental period. Well, in a few months time we got invoiced for the repair of the damage, which we were advised to dispute by the same agent and once again assured that all they have to do is report it as "damage from the previous rental". We have emailed and called Europcar customer service to notify we are officially disputing the claims that we have caused the damage. We have got no response after that for months and assumed that maybe it was resolved. However, recently were contacted by Shakespeare Martineau, which is Europcar's legal representation, who have claimed since we neither disputed the claim nor did we pay the funds, we are now threatened by court proceedings and additional charges.

It is extremely sad and disheartening how the company viciously deceives and manipulates their clients to cover unjust fees. We will probably end up paying a large sums of money for repairs of damage we never caused.</div>

Again.
I hired a van over a weekend to move some household things.
When I got to my destination I noticed one of the side trims had fallen off the Van.
When I returned the van on a Sunday there was no one on site to complain to.
I received a notice that I would be charged for the value of the repair despite paying for extra insurance.
Totally unacceptable views when I complained they said it’s my responsibility to check all the trim and accessories are firmly connected to the van. What the hell europecar, if I hire a vehicle from you I’m not going to spend 2 hours giving it a full MOT before I drive it off the car park.
End result I’ve been billed an extra £230 for a £80 piece of trim which they’ve clearly inflated the cost of and charged me. A £45 admin charge.
I hope this lets europecar know there is a growing band of unhappy customers out there. We keep your company in profit, you need to start listening to us.</div>

                <div class='text'>This company is not reliable, be careful people, I've booked online, paid in full, and after rental, I've been charged another bill from the card that was secured for the deposit, when i called them, they've said was a problem with their other dealership, and will look into case. It's been nearly a month and no response, i keep sending emails but ignoring. Their website also when you want to contact by mail, says there is a problem, they are working on it, try later. The customer service not responding, or just tell you to wait.so if you're thinking to book with them, please have a look at the reviews first, they will charge extra, without informing, from the deposit. I will take this matter further to trading standards and also the Ombudsman.</div>

                <div class='text'>Absolute disgusting customer service on the phone and in person.

Stockport branch delivered the car to me with less than a full tank petrol and while I returned it with the same amount, they still went on and charged me for it.

I called the main number and they said they would make a note of it it. I went personally to the Stockport branch and they said they would refund it. A month later and still no refund and they are not answering the phone. Avoid Europecar at ALL cost.

Not surprising how low their score is.</div>

Ill try to cut it short
Rented a Skodia fabia which has a cargo space of 380l. I was given a toyota yaris cargis space of 170l with 2 kids and alot of luggage nowhere near in comparison to size. i got a Brand new car with no working headlights.

I emailed them and told them about it and was basically told there was no news of this i dont care basically. dont use europcar they have no care for their customers or safety. heres a snippet below of their comments about the non working headlight.

Finally, as per the station comments, no communication regarding the lights issue was found.

''trust me the lights didnt work. what do they mean by this and none of the contact numbers i tried worked to tell them about the fault''

Absolute joke of a company. imagine how dangerous it could of been if I was driving back with my family and it got dark before i noticed

                <div class='text'>I hired a car through EasyJet in innsbruch, Austria. On returning the car, the car hire people told me that there were two scratches on the door and bumper and the total repair cost would be Euro 2100. The excess payable is limited to Euro975, but the car hire people say that this excess is per scratch, making it possible that you would end up paying more than the car is worth. This seems utterly bizarre. No one in Europcar seems to understand how quoting for work works, let alone their own insurance policies. This position is not resolved and is ongoing.</div>

                <div class='text'>Worst Car Rental Experience – AVOID AT ALL COST.

Europcar is the worst car rental company I’ve ever dealt with. Their business is built on hidden fees, poor service, and poorly damage claims process.
• Damage Claims – Their damage claims department is the worst process on earth don’t sign anything and avoid. If somehow you have damage on the ie tyre damage due to a pothole they charge you an extortionate amount of money. Been disputing since January and now is the time they want to open things up again, when you want information from them they get quiet but anything to do with them and money they are loud. they ignored my dispute and charged me a ridiculous amount.
• Rude & Unhelpful Customer Service – If you try to challenge their charges, good luck. Their customer service team either ignores you or keeps passing you from one department to another with no resolution.
• Unclear Pricing & Hidden Fees – They lure you in with what looks like a good deal, only to hit you with unexpected charges later.

Avoid Europcar at all costs! If you don’t want to waste time and money. stay far away from this company!</div>

                <div class='text'>I turned up. We had an agreement to rent the car that I wanted, and that you had not provided me with the European branded car for which I selected from your website against the other options which was an MG style car, which was cheaper. I chose the more expensive option of the Peugeot 30083008. That was on offer as I wanted a European safe vehicle to travel in Europe.
I felt threatened by the manager and forced into taking a more expensive car to keep my family safe whilst in the car traveling in the UK .
I am bitterly disappointed with how it treated. It was embarrassing for my family. We just traveled 24 hours over 24 hours from Australia to rent a car from a reputable international brand and was treated very very poorly with disrespect and told good luck, we will cancel your order, and it’s 6 PM on a Friday night. Good luck trying to find another car company to help you. I was backing into a corner and had no other option. I could not fit the luggage the car that you were provided me that’s why I wanted the Peugeot 3008 that I ordered that I reserved that you could not provide once again your manager was very rude.</div>

I trust this answers your query and I apologise for any inconvenience caused.

Graham - it was a lot of hassle for nothing

                <div class='text'>Europcar at London Stansted is running a scam to fraudulently charge customers for extras they explicitly refuse. I clearly stated FIVE times that I did not want the premium cover, yet they added it anyway without my consent.

The agent, Fred, even lied to my face, telling me the extra charge was just the rental deposit—when in reality, it was the premium cover I had rejected. Later, he even called me for feedback, completely unaware that he had charged me for the cover! This proves that Europcar is either incompetent or deliberately deceiving customers to steal their money.

When I complained, Europcar’s customer service dismissed my case, simply stating that I had signed the contract—completely ignoring the fact that I was misled and scammed into doing so. This is outright fraud.

I will be reporting Europcar to UK Trading Standards, disputing the charge with my credit card provider, and will continue leaving reviews until this issue is resolved. Avoid Europcar at all costs unless you want to be scammed!</div>

                <div class='text'>I had an extremely frustrating experience with Europcar UK due to unjust charges and a lack of accountability.

First, I was charged over £100 for roadside assistance, which was never properly explained at the rental desk as a daily fee instead of a one-time charge. Had this been made clear, I would have declined or opted for full insurance, which would have been a far better choice. Instead, I was rushed into signing multiple documents without any real explanation.

Even worse, I was charged over £200 for a faulty tyre that developed a bubble after just 215 miles over 8 days—something that shouldn’t happen with a properly maintained vehicle. This raises serious concerns about Europcar’s safety standards. It seems that Europcar relies on renters purchasing insurance to cover defective or substandard parts, knowing they can shift the cost to insurance companies rather than ensuring vehicles are well-maintained. Those who decline extra coverage are left footing the bill for Europcar’s own negligence.

Hoping for fair treatment, I escalated this to BVRLA, expecting them to step in. But rather than questioning Europcar’s practice of shifting costs onto customers, BVRLA chose to focus only on Europcar’s paperwork, avoiding any real attempt to hold them accountable. This approach allows Europcar to continue misleading and overcharging customers without consequences.

Renters deserve better—clear terms, properly maintained vehicles, and fair business practices. Not hidden charges, misleading explanations, and financial penalties for defects that aren’t their fault.</div>

                <div class='text'>Europcar LCY very much operates a fraud scheme here as they charge customers for "damage" that is non existent or that they claim is the customer's fault.

In my case, I received emails after my rental that there was “damage” to the car. Photos were provided, but I am unable to see any damage in the photos. I have attached a photo they sent, apparently there is a scratch on the front bumper but I do not see one, especially at the resolution provided. Not to mentioning claiming "damage" on a bumper - a bumper! - just screams scam.

I was not asked to inspect the vehicle prior to the rental. I was not given any evidence of the condition of the car prior to the rental. (However, the pickup attendant tried to upsell me to cars that were 8x and 6x more expensive than my rental.)

Upon return (to London City), the attendant required me to drive to a remote part of the parking lot for the return - far from the Europcar office and designated return area, with no other cars around, and extremely far from the terminal. I now know why - to be out of view in order to execute a damages claim scam.

The car was only driven 4 times during the rental, and did not impact anything during those 4 trips.

Claiming that I am responsible for damages is scam-like, inefficient, inappropriate, and terrible customer service. When I stated so to the claims rep, they claimed I should've read the 49-page Terms and Conditions prior to the rental.

Highly advise renting elsewhere.</div>

                <div class='text'>I had booked to pick up a car with Europcar at Birmingham Airpot in England through an online website. I found the sales person very arrogant he refused me the saying they could not verify me through there credit agency search. Which I found difficult to understand considering I had taken a car from the same location twice in the past few months prior to the last refused rental.

Nevertheless I got charged for the rental, I was told that as Europcar didn’t take me payment the third party will refund the money. I got the feeling it’s because I was happy to sign the contract even after been told that I would be liable to the damage to the car because I refused to take out any extra add insurance from them, because this same person who stated they could not find my name on a credit check was present the last time I rented from that branch and I refused to take extra insurance from them. I actually choose Europcar because I believed it to be a reputable company, never again.</div>

                <div class='text'>Car rental for christmas in Cork, booked via HolidayCars. I bought a CD waver insurance policy which I showed at the desk on collection of the car. I had to use my debit card instead of a credit card as the PIN had been changed by my wife. Apparently using my debit card meant that I had to take compulsory and very expensive CD insurance that increased the cost by 112 euros. This was not exp[lained to me at the desk. On return I was invoiced for this extra amount and emailed their support. This was answered that I had signed the agreement when renting so nothing could be done. My point is that I cannot read the full agreements when renting a car especially when stressed to get to my final destination and with a queue behind me. I had bought a policy to cover the excess so clearly did not want or need extra insurance. I think that Europcar should have refunded this charge but they stopped replying to my follow up emails. I regard this as misleading me. Poor.</div>

I understand these are a budget car rental but the lack of customer service makes it feel like it's not even an established business
RUDE telephone staff ZERO business etticate
Called the branch over 20 times and when you ring for 21 mins the phone just cuts off!! We had to call EUROPCAR head office to complain an they can't even get through to the branch.
BOOKED US A RENTAL THEN GAVE THE RENTAL SOMEONE ELSE THEN PROMISED TO CALL BACK BUT DIDNT STILL AWAITING A CALL BUT DOUBT IT WILL HAPPEN.
Very inexperienced what would seem like teenagers as the staff that you do eventually communicate with as they are stroppy, rude and have no knowledge on their job description
ABSOLUTE FARSE OF A COMPANY I DOUBT THEY ARE EVEN A REGISTERED COMPANY AS THEY DO NOT OPERATE LIKE ONE
If it's a car rental with a quality serv9ce you need AVOID AVOID AVOID EUROPCAR AT ALL COSTS!!!!</div>

                <div class='text'>Let me first say this complaint was slowly escalated to the company CEO, who appears to be ignorant or deaf, maybe both!! No reply!! However this was in desperation to correct a very justifiable grievance, that had failed at branch level and also Customer services at corporate office. So here goes..
I had ordered and paid for a manual Intermediate sized SUV. I received an Automatic COMPACT SUV. Europcar's argument is they are MONETARY the same value, so a clear downsize is OK, even if it was NOT discussed, or even mentioned with me at the counter, when collecting my vehicle. In fairness I should have noticed when I got my vehicle, but it was parked next a large Merc SUV so just thought it looked small. My vehicle was a Hyundai Bayon, a very small and questionable SUV of any sort. I had to get to Portsmouth to pick up a disabled family friend and was already late(flight) so headed off. We just managed to get her mobility scooter in the boot but had to use the back seat for her walking frame, mine and her suitcases plus a backpack. Dangerous and also risking damaging the seats. These important facts have been totally overlooked by Europcar, who keep trotting out the same line about "Monetary" values of both vehicles were the same. Presumably for my 5 day Intermediate SUV, they could have given me a Luxury car for 2 days or Tiny car for 8 days, because it's the same Monetary value - extreme but the same logic. I never expected the CEO to deal with it, but delegate to an area/district manager who can have rung me and got my side. A request for an area/district managers contact details was made, but again ignored. This incident happened over 2 months ago but wanted to give ample time for someone to act, which is only fair. Long winded?? There lots more I could say.</div>

                <div class='text'>Do not waste your money, number of issues during my hire. Won't help you once they have your money, excuse after excuse.

Just been back and forth with customer services and they clearly think their perspective is always correct. Also their customer service advisors are shocking, had to remind them I was the customer. Replacement car offered a Fiat 500 which was not suitable and there is not attempt to correct matters. Spent hours on the telephone chasing them for an update, when a car was not available they suggested go to Manchester to swap the vehicle. Are you actually having a laugh? Then they say we are not saying you do this, so what are you saying?

Don't want anyone to go through the experience I did, so please find another hire company where they can look after you as you should be being a paying customer.</div>

Read our Guidelines for Reviewers
We chose europ car through rentalcars.com to rent a car for 4 days. It was supposed to be £125 for 2 people plus insurance. On arrival to pick car up the person behind the counter tried to charge us extra insurance without us saying yes. This would have been £100 extra!!!!! Luckily we realised before we made transaction. After we collected car we realised that we also were charged £55 for second driver. Then we realised that on our bank statement we were charged twice for the rental. We are now having the misfortune of having to claim the money this second payment back , which means you have to jump through hoops finding bank statements and proof of over charge even though they can see for themselves we were double charged …. AVOID!</div>

                <div class='text'>Rip off!!!!

Got cheap car rental through Booking.com for Europcar. Even paid an additional amount on the booking for full insurance for a 7 day hire.

Arrived at Fuerteventura airport and was told that the full insurance wasn’t any good as it was taken through a third party. They sold me the full insurance for €285 on top of what I had already paid!!!!! This ensured that any damage would be waived.

Picked up the car and noticed a few marks on it - I wasnt bothered as I had full cover.

Returned the car after 7 days, and with no damage to it. They scoured the car and told me I’d damaged the rear of the car (I hadn’t). Luckily I’d taken out their rip off insurance, so I could walk away worry free.

Can’t help but feel there’s some sort of scam going on here.

Stay away!!!!!</div>

                <div class='text'>Told car would be delivered Friday. it was not, then told Monday. First car totally not suitable, it finally seems that the car size issue is sorted so am told a 13;00-14;00 delivery. now 14:48 still no car call the office and am told they are having lunch and so they cant give a time the car is coming they will leave after lunch.. this is Purfleet office,

Absolute disaster, now having read reviews will be going over the car with a fine toothed comb and making a video of any marks or dinks on the car as I seem to be seeing hundreds of customers complaining about unfair charges. Is this company truly this bad? To management why allow your staff to specify a delivery time and then twice not turn up and then tell you they wont be leaving until lunch is over. get real... it would seem you deserve every bad review you are getting if this is the service you are providing.</div>

                <div class='text'>I am so angry with this company - On collecting the SUV, it was not the requested intermediate SUV I ordered, it was tiny and so I had to pay an additional 160GBP to fit the family luggage in a larger car. I had to wait for the new car as it was just having a puncture repair, the AMG locking wheel nuts where evident in the car on eventual entry. We dropped the car off and two weeks later, I received an additional invoice for 380 GBP for some light scratches on the underside of the nearside, rear wheel arch. It was impossible to make a scratch in this position UNLESS this was originally caused when changing the oversized AMG wheels. First and last time with this company. Awful.</div>

                <div class='text'>Am a disabled customer. Was meant to have a car delivered on Friday. It didn’t turn up.which means I have been housebound die to the let down of them not showing up. Then when I called them they kept telling me it woidl come sat. Still car. After countless calls I’m told that re office is closed and it will now be Monday. I shall post again Monday with update. But having read the reviews of how poor this company is I am not too keen at all in dealing further. My confidence in them so far is terribly low. Now I’m fully expecting to be scammed over fuel or supposed damage to the car. Who are the directors of the company. You would think that they would be concerned at such a huge amount of bad reviews.</div>

                <div class='text'>Follow-Up on Recent Rental Experience – Hidden Fees and Unfair Charges

Dear Europcar Team,

Thank you for responding to my initial review. While I stand by my praise for Peter’s outstanding customer service at Heathrow, I feel it’s necessary to share the full picture of my experience — not just for your awareness but also as a warning to future customers.

After reviewing my bill, I discovered numerous hidden fees that were never clearly explained. I was offered an upgrade that I was told would cost an additional £20, but I was later charged £150. Worse still, I was asked to sign documents under pressure and wasn’t given a copy, leaving me unaware of the full charges until it was too late.

This lack of transparency and the feeling of being misled has completely overshadowed the initial positive experience. It’s deeply disappointing, especially during what was already a difficult time for me.

Unfortunately, due to this experience, I will not be using Europcar again and strongly advise others to be extremely cautious when reviewing their rental agreements and charges.

I hope you take this feedback seriously and address these issues to prevent similar situations for future customers.

Best regards,
Owen

(My original review below)

Outstanding Service from Peter at Europcar Heathrow

I recently visited Europcar at Heathrow on the morning of Friday, 21st, to collect a car for a difficult journey to a close relative’s funeral. Understandably, I wasn’t in the best of spirits, but the exceptional service I received from Peter truly made a difference.

From the moment I arrived, Peter’s warm demeanor and positive energy were evident. He went above and beyond to assist me, showing genuine care and professionalism throughout the process. His kindness and willingness to help lifted my spirits more than he probably realizes.

It’s rare to come across someone who not only excels in their role but also impacts customers on a personal level during tough times. Thanks to Peter, a stressful day became a little easier.

I am deeply grateful for his support and will definitely be returning to Europcar in the future because of this experience. Thank you, Peter!</div>

                <div class='text'>Refused service because I had my original paper licence issued 1997 and passport for photo ID!!! Was told I must have a photocard driving licence - utterly ridiculous!

I booked to hire a car from Europcar, paying in full - when I arrived there was an issue with no car available so I was asked to wait. After an hour the gentleman said he’d take copies of my paperwork - he stated that my original paper driving licence was not valid despite all details being correct (name, address, signature etc) and me having my passport with me. I explained that I’d never been required to get a photo driving licence as this was a valid government document issued by the DVLA. I suggest Europcar staff are actually trained correctly in future - a complete waste of my time!

I went next door to Enterprise and hired with absolutely no issues</div>

                <div class='text'>I have been a Europcar Privilege member for 20 years, but my recent experience at London Stansted was nothing short of a rip-off. Despite clearly stating FIVE times that I did NOT want the premium cover and only needed the basic rental, I was still charged for it.

When I noticed the extra charge, I contacted customer service, expecting them to fix their mistake. Instead, I was met with zero accountability and refusal to refund. This is not just bad service—it’s deceptive and feels like a deliberate upsell scam.

Loyal customers deserve honesty and transparency, but Europcar has shown neither. I will be taking this further with my credit card provider and consumer rights authorities. Avoid this company unless you want to be overcharged!</div>

                <div class='text'>I recently rented a vehicle from Europcar on 02/02/2025, and my experience has been extremely disappointing. The rental process was smooth, and I returned the vehicle in perfect condition, with no damage whatsoever. Europcar even refunded my deposit, confirming there were no issues at the time of return.

However, 18 days later, I received an email claiming that I had caused a 5-15 cm scuff on the front bumper. This accusation is completely false. I drove carefully, parked safely, and at no point was the bumper exposed to any situation that could have caused such damage.

I immediately disputed the claim and requested proof, including time-stamped photos and inspection reports. So far, Europcar has not provided clear evidence that the damage occurred while the vehicle was in my possession. Given the time delay, I strongly suspect the damage happened after my rental and that Europcar is unfairly holding me responsible.

This experience has been frustrating, and I now see many similar complaints from other customers. It feels like a deliberate scam to extract extra money from customers long after their rental has ended. Beware! Always take detailed photos and videos before and after your rental to protect yourself.

I would strongly advise against renting from Europcar unless you want to risk being charged for damages you didn’t cause.</div>

Bought back our hire car to Salzburg Airport, an hour later got an email stinging us for £50 for ‘damages’ to the interior and ‘specialist cleaning’ required, there was a couple of foot prints on a foot mat, absolute joke!

                <div class='text'>I hired a plug in hybrid. Drove about 8 miles in city traffic within 30 mph speed limit. I recharged the battery overnight on my own charger. This company took £21 off my lodged credit card for “7 litres of petrol used”. I appealed twice and both times they replied that “the charge stands”. I know that a plug in hybrid system will choose electric before petrol in the driving circumstances I have described. Would they do similar if damage was found that the hirer didn’t cause?
I have since read reviews that they are a “Terrible Company”. Avoid for goodness sake.</div>

                <div class='text'>Hired a car from their Gloucester Branch on Saturday picking up the car at 8am and returning at 6pm. I only got the car at 8.31am despite getting there on time. But thats not my main issue as the branch only had 1 member of staff serving a lot of people she can only do much.

I returned the car at 6pm as stipulated in my rental agreement. The car had no damage and the fuel level was correct and the branch confirmed this.

The nightmare comes to being charged the rental for 2 days. I got an invoice being charged for an extra day saying i returned the car on Monday at 8.01 am which is ridiculous. I had the car for just 8hrs but being charged for 2 days how is that possible. And now they still haven't processed my deposit refund. I am out of pocket because of their incompetence and this is stressing me.

The most annoying thing is Europcar kept quiet about this had i not flagged it, it would have gone unnoticed. I am very disappointed about this and will delay me getting back my deposit which i desperately need.

Case of big companies lacking empathy.</div>

                <div class='text'>Absolutely horrific experience from beginning to end. I will never use this company again, whether in the UK or abroad. I rented a car for 14 days, I never got to drive it as the battery was flat. I had to call the AA twice. On the 4th day they took the car back. They agreed to a refund but still charged me £60 for the 4 days that I did NOT drive it. The worst was yet to come!
They refunded me (except for the 4 days) BUT then accidentally charged me 4 times the amount they refunded me! No one in the office I hired it from could assist as it's all done via head office which is a call center and no one can assist. They ask you to email and no one assists properly. This is still ongoing and I have reported them to my credit card company and plan to take it further as I still have not been returned the missing funds. They will probably send a link asking me to email based on their other responses to reviews! What a disgrace.</div>

                <div class='text'>**AVOID AT ALL COSTS**

I will never use Europcar or recommend them at all. So my Mercedes generated a fault which went in for warranty repair. I was offered a courtesy car with Europcar which developed a tyre fault out of the blue (no collision occurred no pot hole was hit). The inconvenience was immense as it couldn’t be sorted on our drive and had to be taken to Kwikfit.

The worst thing is they are trying to sting me with the cost!!

                <div class='text'>Terrible Experience with Europcar UK – Misleading Practices and Unauthorised Charges

I had a deeply disappointing experience with Europcar UK during my recent car rental. I booked a car for my family trip from 20th December 2024 to 20th January 2025 and paid in full (GBP 1,639.81) upfront. However, the problems began as soon as I arrived at the Gatwick Airport North Terminal after a 30-hour flight from Brisbane.

Despite explicitly informing the staff that I did not require additional insurance because I have Allianz Travel Insurance covering rental car excess, I was handed a document to sign under the pretense of providing a security deposit. Later, I discovered it was a completely new rental agreement with added charges for unwanted insurance and a so-called "free upgrade" to a Peugeot PG5008. The upgrade was presented as complimentary because the originally booked MG HS was unavailable, yet I was later charged for it.

Upon returning the car at Heathrow Airport, I was unexpectedly charged GBP 20 for cleaning without prior disclosure. The staff claimed it was because the car floor required more than five minutes to clean. This charge was never mentioned in the rental agreement.

After returning to Australia, I discovered an unauthorized charge of AUD 3,889.19 on my credit card, labeled as a second rental payment. I immediately contacted Europcar but received only an automated response. Despite multiple follow-ups, I was given no proper explanation or resolution.

To make matters worse, I noticed additional unexplained charges of GBP 45 each on 12th and 13th February 2025. Again, these charges were processed without my consent and with no justification provided.

This experience has highlighted Europcar's lack of transparency, misleading practices, and poor customer service. I strongly advise others to avoid Europcar if they want a stress-free and honest rental experience.</div>

                <div class='text'>I’ve been a long time Europcar customer but after my most recent experience I’ll never be booking with them again. Due to a flight cancellation, I needed to delay pickup by a few days. Rather than allow amendment of dates, I was told that to make this change I’d have to pay for a new booking. Which would cost double what I paid originally, despite it being for fewer days. Not only this but they told me they would need to downgrade my car type as the original wasn’t available. Which I can only imagine would have meant that if I’d made the original booking, they wouldn’t have had the car category I’d ordered and paid for anyway. Completely unhelpful and rude on the phone. This is just blatant profiteering at the expense of customers.

UPDATE
Contacted them as advised below and got back a confused and nonsensical answer - pasted below. It literally makes no sense that if I want to just reduce the length of my booking that my original car type wouldn’t be available. Seriously avoid.

“Your booking was initially created on the 17/01/2025 at which point the branch had more fleet available which would explained that the booked vehicle, for later dates would not be available anymore and the category you would have initially booked be under high demand.”</div>

                <div class='text'>Booked in advance online for £139 - they ended up stinging me for another £600 when I went to collect the car at the airport. Half of this was an additional insurance premium to avoid paying a €2,500 excess, the other two charges called variously emergency management fees and a special location surcharge (the special location being the airport). I was forced into signing the contract as I had a pre-booked place on a ferry and no time to argue about it. No-one with enough English to explain. No come back from customer services. Total cost during my holiday €4 per kilometre.AVOID, AVOID, AVOID

Oh yes - and pay no heed to their reply below. I've contacted the 'customer service team' who have declined to offer any kind of refund. The tone was 'Scammed you! - tee hee!'</div>

                <div class='text'>I asked a friend to track down a van hire company as i am moving and they found Europcar. What a disappointment. Europcar decided not to accept the method of payment my friend wanted to use and after over an hour they decided they could accept it after all. Because I work all week and I'm away I had one day to move my stuff. It isn't all moved because so much time was lost messing around and the van was so small when it came it was basically a car with the back seats down. Not worth 65 pound. Definitely not after the over an hour mess around. So disappointed.</div>

                <div class='text'>The experience to get the car was fine and Led from St Pancras branch was helpful and asked me to sign up for fuel tank option. Upon returning my car, Europcar still charged me for a fuel tank option despite I return the car back with fuel tank. Even the return statement said I returned the call with fuel tank. I have made an investigation, case number #22353882 and I’m still waiting for my refund. I see you replied people’s comment with the Europcar link. Your link does not work so I had to call my customer service and they were not helpful. Please, I just want my refund back for the mistake that you made.</div>

                <div class='text'>I hired a vehicle before Christmas and upon returning it Europcar gave me back the deposit. I hoped that would be the end of it as the rental experience was not good and I felt ripped off. However, over 7 weeks later Europcar debited my bank account with a large amount of money without my knowledge or authorisation. Their customer services department is less than useless and not responding. Clearly Europcar is a company that cannot be trusted (and certainly not with your data and bank account details) so my advice is to avoid at all costs. If you have used Europcar before then clearly need to be vigilant and keep a close eye on your bank account for subsequent fraud transaction(s).</div>

                <div class='text'>They charged me for damage I didn't do. When I returned my rental, they said damage that had been highlighted by them was not in the system but don't worry I won't be charged. What a joke.

I was never informed of the charge before hand, it just appeared on my credit card since someone mistyped my email address.

When I argued the point, I was told it would take 5 working days to investigate to confirm. It took well over a month.

During this time I was told it was resolved, with no details so I called them and they were still investigating. Then not to call we contact you asap. After a month and many, many emails and calls, I was told I was getting a refund in 3 to 10 days. Then I wasn't. Then it would take 3 to 21 days.

When I asked then to cover the interest their error had charged to my credit card, I was told no. It's not possible. Followed by how they offer excellent customer service.

This company doesn't know their a*@ehole from their elbow. Avoid.</div>

                <div class='text'>Booked the car was told on the app I would have to pay 124 pounds extra which isn’t great but whatever on arrival I was told I need to pay an extra 1200 pounds in total because I am 25 and that’s a young driver even though online it said 25 is fine. Got all that crap sorted ended up paying an extra 400 instead which is still a joke considering I had already paid for it online but never mind I have to get the kids home. I go to the car it looked nice small crack in the rear light took a picture of it but forgot to take a picture of the inside. There was a rip on the carpet and they are claiming it was me the car was drove no more than 4 time for about 30 minutes each way we had the car for 10 days so it was barely used just sat parked and somehow this old ass rip was me. Opened my bank today to see another 400 pound taken out without contacting me at all. Company is a joke just avoid and catch a train or bus</div>

                <div class='text'>Terrible! I was supposed to get a hire car when I was dropping mine off to the garage to be repaired. 25mins before the appointment I had a missed call from Europecar. I tried 14 times over the course of 90mins to call them back. I eventually got through and was told by a rude man that my car wouldn’t be there for another 2hrs. You can’t speak to anyone on the phone unless you want to book a car or make a payment for anything else it’s nearly impossible to get through.</div>

                <div class='text'>We hired a car for 7 days, and while hiring the car they were very friendly, but on our last day when we were heading back to the airport the car wouldn’t start. We tried ringing and it took ages to get through but when we told them what happened they said we had to ring the AA. We explained we were heading to the airport and didn’t have much time to waste but he just said I can’t help. You have to ring the AA if they can’t start it they will organise a pick up and you can follow them to the nearest Europcar centre and they will give you another car. We explained we had a 1 1/2 hour drive and by this time needed to be at the airport in less than 2 hours but he just kept saying I can’t do anything else. We then called the AA who said it could be up to an hour before someone could get to us. Obviously we couldn’t wait around for that. Luckily we were staying close ish to the airport with our cousins the night before so we didn’t have such a long drive that morning. They said they would wait for the AA and we had to book a taxi to take us to heathrow. Luckily the traffic wasn’t to bad and we got there just in time. As we were boarding the plane we had a message from our cousins to say the AA had been unable to fix the car and were just then picking it up to take to the euro car centre. Had we not taken the taxi we would have definatly missed our flight. We contacted the customer services centre multiple times after this and they IF they answered my emails it was not with an apology, I was told in the first response to upload the receipt for the taxi and they would pay it back. I complained about the lack of help and the fact we couldn’t use it that last day so that should be reimbursed to but they just said they had closed the case and could do no more. They then sent us an email to say they would reimburse the full mount and take out the full mount minus the cost of the taxi…. But that the reimbursement could take up to a month for international transactions. Without checking first with us they had taken a further £2080 out on our card leaving us then with over £4300 on our credit card while we awaited the payment to eventually go back in. I emailed 4 times after that money was taken out against our credit card without permission… I asked to speak to a manager each time. I never had any responses from those last emails. I am outraged and disgusted by the lack of support from Europcars, I will never use them again and I am going to write this warning on every social media site I can find.</div>

                <div class='text'>Gave 1 star as couldn’t give minus score! I am a motability customer who has been messed around by these people and been left high and dry. My own car is awaiting pick by garage, europcar are supposed to deliver a car - except although they say they will contact 24hrs ahead of booking they don’t. When finally get through their horrendous phone systems which switch you off and tell you to call back later after sitting for an hour - they say they will be delivering a car on day expected but 5pm - in the dark which means no opportunity to check vehicle, then on morning of delivery told definitely happening but can’t confirm car (booked electric suv) after midday call to say can’t deliver - basically I live in small rural town over hour away from them so of course they don’t want to deliver! I can travel and get though… the title motability customer gives clue in title - I cannot collect, get a taxi (few taxi firms will lose a cab for 2/3 hours on a Friday pm when they have school contacts to honour)… this is 3rd time they have failed with their obligations, apparently I can trust them to deliver when I’m not around to sign for it… if these guys cannot even undertake basic customer service skills or basic project management (can’t guarantee your booking for day booked maybe up to 3 days)… or in my case even with 2 weeks notice on booking they don’t source a car in time or deliver as promised… they made me feel completely worthless.. my car cannot get mended as I cannot be without a car!</div>

                <div class='text'>Never trust Europcar, their employees and their processes. They all are waiting for the opportunity to manipulate and deceive you to earn cheap money and commissions. After returning the vehicle I noticed on my invoice that an extra charge of amount £223.04 has been applied to my bank account (in the name of 'Premium protection'). I never asked to add any additional service on top of the booking amount of £ 327.35 which was paid already at the time of booking (before even using the rental service). If I need any additional services, I always make sure that everything is in place and paid for to avoid any surprises and to keep a track of by expense and budget.
I clearly mentioned "NO" multiple times for any additional services to Europe car rental agent (It must be recorded on their camera).
Even when I said "NO" multiple times to any kind of additional services, Europcar's agent printed 'Premium protection agreement' papers without informing me and put in front of me to get my signature with other many agreement documents which is really deceiving and manipulating the valuable customer and forcing unnecessary extra charges to the customers while they are trusting the process. When I explained the situation to them and asked for refund, they denied. Never ever going to book from them. I request you all to avoid such shameless deceivers instead of getting deceived.</div>

                <div class='text'>Avoid Europcar at all costs! I’ve rented from them TWO times, and each experience has been a NIGHTMARE with three different issues. 🚨 They downgraded my car, offered only a partial refund, and charged hidden fees that don’t add up. Their atrocious customer service rejects every claim and ignores all requests.

They also profit off unsuspecting customers by opting out of automatic congestion charge payments, leading to unnecessary penalties. This company operates like a scam – sneaky fees, dishonesty, and zero accountability. DO NOT RENT FROM EUROPCAR! 🚫

Edit to Europcar's response:
@Europcar UK, your response is disingenuous. I am already engaged in multiple email complaints and disputes with your customer service team, who have repeatedly dismissed my legitimate concerns and failed to address your unethical business practices. I am documenting every interaction, and my extreme dissatisfaction with Europcar’s handling of this matter is precisely why I am sharing this review. I will continue to highlight my experience to ensure other unsuspecting customers are aware of the issues they may face when dealing with Europcar.</div>

My car was In for a warranty repair and a replacement was provided by Europcar
The car was delivered to the dealership for me to pickup up next day,
When I arrived I couldn't start the car due to flat battery, I then had to drive back home in own car (Motobiĺity vehicle). Motobility rang me to inform me that Europcar would not replace the vehicle and that I would have to contact the A/A to arrange a repair or have the car returned to their Stockport branch.
Rather than go through a stand off, I contacted the A/A who came out and replaced the battery.
I returned next day to pick up the vehicle.
I just cannot believe Europcar did not know the battery was faulty before they dropped the car off.

                <div class='text'>Do not use Europcar and if you do be prepared to pay over twice the price agreed. I arranged to hire a car before leaving the UK for my holiday in Mexico and when I got there they would not release the car unless I bought a further insurance that doubled the cost of the car. The other people that also did the same as me, trying to collect their car, where also being fleeced by Europcar. I raised this on Facebook and Europcar requested I take this issue off Facebook and they would sort it out for me. If they offer this, do not believe them.. This is all a con. Never use them they are crocked.
I tried the customer service who sounded like they would try and help. They asked a lot of questions and then went to sleep. I tried to email them and they just ignored me. I think that customer service is there just to string you out in the hope that you will just go away.</div>

Interesting reading some other reviews, wish we had prior to hiring a car. I always take photos of the car, looking for dents or scratches etc. Have never thought to check rear wiper to make sure rubber blade is there, will from now on. Did the right thing and reported it when took car back, within 24 hours of realising it was missing. Initially all seemed ok, security deposit was returned. 3 and a half weeks later notified us we would be held responsible as it was 'new damage'. Not only did we then get invoiced for the rear wiper arm also, that was not damaged to our knowledge, was in working order, that is how we realised there was no rubber blade. Still in the dispute process and my friend's account used for the security has had a withdrawal for the full invoice without our knowledge it was about to occur. Will never use Europcar and neither will any of our family or friends. We will be sure to let our travel agent know so she doesn't use them either, it was her booking for us.</div>

                <div class='text'>Dreadful experience. I hired the van for 3 days on a delivery and collection basis. The van was great. The staff were not. They didn't collect the van as agreed and unjustly took additional monies from my account without my knowledge or authorisation. I had to report my card as lost to prevent further payments being taken. Avoid.</div>

                <div class='text'>I have rented several times from Europcar in the past 12 months, and had no issues until now. I have been charged £106 (inc £45 admin fee) for a scratch to an alloy that I did not cause. I’ve pleaded my case, and they aren’t interested. They also said that I drove almost 100 miles more than I did (no mileage limit but still incorrect). I guarantee that they won’t be fixing the scratch either as the car had various pre existing dents and scrapes.

I won’t be renting from them ever again, which will cost them more than the alleged damage that they’ve charged me for.

I should add that the staff at the Aberdeen Airport branch are great, and always very polite and helpful, always go out of their way to help.

EDIT: Do not be fooled by Europcar’s response to negative reviews. They do not engage with further emails, and clearly have little interest in resolving any issues.</div>

The Advisor at Wolverhampton didnt even Apologise, I made my way to your rental place and had NO apology. I have a clean license, good credit rating, do not understand how POOR this company is.

I am still waiting for my refund ASAP.

Absolutely DISGUSTING!

Happy went to ENTERPRISE immediately and hired a Vehicle straight away. No Issues, happy to give Enterprise £50 more for the Rental to boost their business.

Lets Hope Enterprise does BETTER than Europcar.

                <div class='text'>Absolutely disgraceful service from their customer service and complaints team. I have reported a GDPR breach and they have done nothing about it. They have been sending emails of my invoice and rental agreement to an address that is not mine. Even after I have stated the email is not mine, they then have the audacity to send a "we are still looking at your case" email to the wrong email AGAIN. No response after reporting the GDPR breach has left me to leave this review in the hope that someone of higher authority who knows what they are doing will follow this up.

If you are in the UK, use Enterprise or Hertz, far better, far smoother process and none of this rubbish.</div>

                <div class='text'>Not only the worst car hire company we have ever used, but the worst company and rudest employees I have ever encounted in my life - and I'm in my 50s.

Lied, lied and lied, left us stranded without a car, and call centres that are in every country except the UK that again, and again, and again and again, said they would transfer us to customer service, but either left us on hold (for up to 50 minutes) or just cut us off. Why do they do that? Because customers are given the opportunity to rate customer service at the end of each call if the call end normally - by cutting people off, or by leaving them stranded on hold for nearly an hour so they customer has to put the phone down, the nasty, rude employees don't get poor ratings (and presumably keep their jobs).

While I was trying to sort out the horrendous problems in branch, another customer came in, with a walking stick, an elderly man, who was promised someone would deliver his hire car in the morning. When nothing arrived he told me he spent hours and hours trying to call the branch but all calls are routed to Morocco or Bulgaria who refused to put him through. A pensioner, he had no option other than to pay for an emergency taxi at 5pm to the branch to find out why he didn't have a hire care. This is what you will deal with if you use Europcar.

Put them out of business... always leave an honest review, or take them to the small claims court if you can. Never, ever, EVER use Europcar.</div>

                <div class='text'>Nightmare. Picked up a car at Gatwick south terminal yesterday evening. I paid for an Audi Q5 but when I arrived they offered me some Alfa Romeo instead which is lower than the class I paid for. After about 30 minutes of driving the yellow check engine light comes on. Complete my journey and try to call them but their office is closed.

The next day (today) at 8:30am I call customer service who put me through to breakdown who then then put me through to the RAC. Waiting a few hours for them and then get a missed call from them but my phone never rang.

Called back Europcar and again got transferred. This time they said they would “deal with it themselves”. Shortly after this I receive a call from the AA. Meet the mechanic and on diagnosis of the issue he tells me the engine light is on because the car is overdue a service! He also advises me to contact europcar and forward on the report. He was a gentleman and very courteous and helpful. I must say.
I spend the rest of the day trying to talk to someone who can help. The worst interaction was with a Vladimir. He said that he couldn’t transfer me to Gatwick even though his colleague managed to an hour before. “But did they pick up?” he asked. No. They didn’t. “So see, I can’t transfer because they never answer the phone.”
I asked to talk to a supervisor. “I’m not allowed to transfer you to a supervisor”
He then said he would send an email to Gatwick and they would reply shortly. His colleague had already sent an email on my behalf several hours previous. I asked him if “shortly” meant by the end of the day but he wouldn’t promise. My interaction with the europcar web of entanglement lasted until 3pm and then the offices were closed.

All day I spent on my foreign mobile racking up charges. I didn’t use the car. It’s not the car I wanted. It is overdue a service so I wonder is it even roadworthy…. Did the right thing but they refused to help or engage.

I rented the car for 3 days to visit a relative who is ill with cancer. I just wanted a hassle free experience. Instead it was a nightmare. Terrible company. Never again.

I shouldn’t have to pay for the day I spent fighting for them to help and not driving thr car. I shouldn’t have to fight for help. Their system appears to be designed to prevent you from getting through to anyone who can help. The first customer service agent should have taken ownership of my problem to begin with.
Maybe tomorrow I will get a call. All I want to advice on what to do? I’m not sure the car is even roadworthy.</div>

First time I get delivered a Kia with a GPF light on dash so it drank fuel.
This time taken 3 days to get me a car and because no one listens to you it wasn't appropriate for our needs. Eventually was put into a MGzs ,again too small for what we need but had to take it or we have no transport..

                <div class='text'>I was their regular customer, but will never use their services again, because after one incident feel like they stole from me. I was using Europcar branch at the London City Airport and rented Fiat 500 on December 18th 2024 for two days. Had no accidents, returned the car safely, only to be told I've made a damage to the front windscreen. A tiny two dots, visible only from close. I'm 100% sure they were there already, but they weren't documented. I did took pictures of the car on the day I've got it, but the problem is that the pictures taken were from the few steps away and although you can see something is there, but if you zoom in, the picture becomes blurry and the damage is not exactly visible. It's so small (like 1mm), you can barely see it from close. So now they've froze my 500£ deposit ant investigating the matter. Investigation is already going for more than a month, no indication when it might end.
But even if it did happen, maybe without me noticing, the damage is so minor, you could literally find 50 more scratches this size throughout the vehicle. I mean, it wasn't a new car, to look at a dot and say you'll need what, to replace the screen? And what is there to investigate for a month and ongoing? I'm a single mother working two jobs to survive, these 500£ are very important for me, but the the company doesn't care.
Also, I would like to point out the extreme rudeness of the Europcar employee who examined the car upon it's return. She noticed the damage straight away (as if she new where to look) and was acting aggressively towards me. Didn't allow me to take the picture of the tag with her name on it and did not write her name on the Statement of Return report she wrote. Unfortunately, I don't remember her name now, at the moment we spoke I felt under stress, in part because how aggressively she spoke.
I will forever regret the day I chose Europcar.</div>

                <div class='text'>Shameless and dishonest Europcar!

My advise to you all is to stay away from this company. They may appear to be competitively priced to begin with, but by the time you see all the nasty extras and hidden charges is already too late. The Customer Support is also in on the trick and they come back to your substantiated dispute with standard automated answers which don't address the problem.

I checked in with a prepaid booking voucher and I was offered three options of cars to choose from, all of similar trim level and of the same category.

At no point whatsoever was I told that any of these choice might be an expensive "upgrade".

No extra charges were ever mentioned.
They just appeared on my credit card one and a half months later.

This is apparenlty a common and standard malpractise as I found similar complaints in various forums.

I guess their reception staff is so commision-driven that they don't mind bending a few rules by lying and hiding charges.

A very dishonest company with no customer orientation and no ethos.

I wouldnt normally bother writting a review but then I thought if this helps even one other potential customer falling victim to these crooks then is worth the effort.</div>

                <div class='text'>Terrible experience with Eurocar! I booked a car online, paid in advance, and when I arrived to pick it up, they refused to rent it to me without any valid reason. The staff was unhelpful and showed no interest in resolving the issue. To make things worse, getting a refund has been a nightmare—slow responses, excuses, and no clear process.

This company is completely unreliable, and their customer service is awful. Avoid them at all costs unless you want to waste your time and money!

                <div class='text'>It's such a shame when an employee of a firm can be so destructive reputationally to them.
I made a complaint about a young man on the desk at Gatwick over 6 weeks ago, and am still awaiting a response [despite being promised feedback after a week]
The young man in question had clearly taken aganist me, which was unfortunate, as we had been travelling all day, were tired, and was hoping to pick our our pre-booked car from the airport without incident.
However this individual seemed to have decided that our business was unwelcome, and proceeded to make this simple piece of administration as difficult and irritating for us as possible. Little tricks, such as demanding that I wrote personal details on a post it, that were already on the booking form, conduct DVLA checks [that i had never been asked to do in the past] fill in paperwork with details already given, and change the booked vehicle for a completely different vehicle, which ended up further as a completely different vehicle once in the lot collecting it [he gave us a Skoda, which clearly was our 'punishment' for daring to challenge him! -I'm pleased to report that the Skoda was excellent, and I enjoyed using it!!!]

It was all rather surprising. I've been hiring vehicles fairly frequently for over 30 years, and Europcar was even our contractor at a couple of firms where I have worked, and we never had any issues.
I have filled out countless booking forms, had my license inspected [which is clean and long standing] and never had a claim on a hire ever.

Perhaps one of their bods will see this, and finally deign to respond to this very annoyed customer one day...</div>

                <div class='text'>Lets see what happens after I post this negative review... My guess is that Europcar respond with a 'We're sorry to hear... etc. etc... Please give us a chance to solve this problem by writing to us at this link - etc etc...' within a few hours. Then I write to them and they write back saying that they are very sorry but they cannot help. Then you write to them again and they don't reply. Cynical business practice designed to exploit the vulnerabilities of TrustPilot's system, and blatant profiteering over decency and ethics - that's Europcar.</div>

                <div class='text'>I requested a rental car from the Hamilton branch, I made the payment and uploaded all the documents.
I received a phone call from Sam saying everything was done and paid for that I could collect the car.
When I arrived I was asked for my address which I had already done online and then got told I was declined.
Why could he not have told me this when he phoned me? I have now been informed it will take upto 10 days for my refund

They clearly make money off clients holding their money for a period of time and getting interest.
Not a reliable company stay well away from them</div>

                <div class='text'>Europcar Oxford tried to scam me of money for some damages were already on the car.

Short story.
On pick up they offered their insurance that would double the rental price and I refused. They bought the car outside and I asked for the existing damages report on the car that I was not provided with and I’ve been told that they are aware of all damages and I will not get charged for them. I took a video of the car in many angles that saved me probably paying over 1000£ in damages fees.
On drop off the guy looked around the car for 1 minute the came to me and said that everything is ok and I will receive my deposit back in 4-5 days, I left and then the scammer went back to the car took photos of 2 scratches and added them to the drop off report and said that they were new ones. I never found out until one week later when I received an email from europcar with the claim against me for 2 scratches on the car. I asked for the drop off report and I couldn’t believe when I saw the pictures of the scratches in the drop off report.
I cannot stress enough telling you how important it is to have videos and photos taken on the start of a hire as they will do everything they can to take some money off you.

Be safe 👍🏻</div>

                <div class='text'>Using their services is looking for problems.
I made a reservation for a car rental with Europcar UK but when picking up the car the rental company does not accept conditions from voucher. Strong pressure to buy additional services, combinations with rental conditions and deposit. Despite the fact that we had a good credit card and did not want to accept the purchase of additional services - we were lied to that it was a deposit and were tricked into charging a few extra fees.

Very serious and strong recommendation - respect yourself and AVOID these greedy cowboys!!!</div>

                <div class='text'>I paid comprehensive insurance while overseas only to get to Europcar Heathrow and be told the car I had rented wasn't available and I had to pay extra insurance. I was given only two options either an upgrade where I had to pay more or an electric car which the guy by the counter said was a bad idea since I was going to drive outside of the UK. I asked why the car I had fully paid wasn't available but got no answer instead the guy would go and talk to his colleagues and then come back trying to make small talk. So after my 23 hour flight the only car available was an expensive upgrade. I was then billed and few days later got a refund then when I returned the car I was billed again.</div>

I tried to call back on 3 occasions but never got an answer except on one occasion the person said I’ll transfer you to the rental place I was collecting from and the phone went back to hold for another 10 minutes then an automated voice told me no one was available please try again. I cancelled my online booking but money had already been taken. Now I have to wait up to 28 days for refund! I emailed hoping for a quicker response but the automated email said they will contact me within 7 days! Give me my money back please!!!</div>

                <div class='text'>Rented car for £89. Ended up with bill Euro 307. FIRST AND LAST TIME WITH THIS COMPANY

They don't give you the car you paid for online.
Put pressure to buy extra insurance for free upgrade.

They do not mention prices are excluding VAT.

On final bill you receive charges such as Environmental contribution (euro 3) Premium Station (euro 42) which are never mentioned at the time of renting.

After a long flight, nobody reads the small print on the contract they make customers sign, then end up with a bill three times the rental price.

Be very careful or ideally avoid this company.

UPDATE: 4 Feb 2025
This company is a joke. They send a reply to the bottom of Trustpilot message. The link takes you to a department who then refers you to the initial department you made the complaints to.

From my end, I informed the HR of our company who stopped working with them, circulated my experience with them on Facebooks so friends are aware and will be mentioning their behavior in every opportunity.</div>

                <div class='text'>AVOID EUROPCAR CAR AT ALL COST
There are many hire companies out there, but sadly Europcar is not the one to use and I would definitely never recommend them or use them ever. I had a hire vehicle from them through my insurance company and 11 days after the vehicle was off hired I received a text message saying they were investigating damage that illedgely happened in my hire period.
11 days later, a text..not even a phone call, and definitely something I am not responsible for. You can't of course speak to a human on the phone, as their complaints procedure only allows there staff to hind behind a keyboard, firing off emails and texts.
Interestingly enough, when you scan social media, I don't appear to be an isolated complaint, and theirs too many customer experiences that suggest them taking money from people's accounts for "damage".. this would appear to be a bit of a buisness trend for them..
I can only give you the benefit of my experience, and I would never deal with them again or encourage anyone to use there service.

                <div class='text'>My insurance hired me a car as my disability car is being repaired at no fault of my own but after a few weeks they asked for the car back, that’s fine so I had it cleaned inside and out that cost me £40 so I didn’t get anything to say it wasn’t clean and the fact I’m a nice person always give it back in same condition and I filled the tank to its capacity literally went over the full tank line BUT yesterday received a text stating I owe them £54.53 for fuel !!
Thank god I took photographs and they were dated as they trying to pull a fast one !! I’m not paying for fuel when I had already filled it .. not my problem what your collection driver done when he left my property!!
The customer services is terrible takes over an hour to speak to anyone and even then they are not interested just say email us with your concerns … absolute joke .. I emailed over 30 hours ago and have nothing back yet. No doubt someone will reply to this with “contact us” no you contact me as your in the wrong.</div>

                <div class='text'>This is what happened to me - when I arrived at Heathrow on holiday from New Zealand I asked Danielle on customer service if they had an automatic option rather than manual - she said could give me an upgrade which I thought was really good of her. At no point did she mention any extra charges, so on trust I signed paperwork where she had over doubled the price of the rental. At the end of the rental period The Europcar charged my card the extra $1050. I contacted Samuel at customer service to say there must be a mistake and could he please check the audio and video so that he could see there was no mention of extra cost for the upgrade. He responded by saying that I had signed the paperwork but did not mention anything about the video or audio footage. I asked him again to consult the footage, but again he did not respond. I asked nicely for his manager or supervisor's contact details but he did not do this either saying that the matter was now closed.

If Eurocar had done the right thing, I would use them again and I would be telling other people about the great service I had received. Instead I am left writing a negative review, which is not good for anyone.</div>

                <div class='text'>You’ve got a cheek with your stupid repeated replies to everyone to give you a chance, I wouldn’t give you a chance if you guys was the last company on earth. Wasters.

One of the worst companies I have ever had to deal with.

My car has had to go in back to the garage for its issues, Europcar was the only choice to provide me a car until mine is rectified. Europcar gave me a 5 seater MG and I said advised this was no good as we require a 7 seater (our 7 seater is in the garage), Europcar told me this was not possible, gave me a car that was absolutely disgusting inside and out and told me it had been valeted, (I have photos) I asked who valeted it stevie wonder?, they then gave me another 5 seater and again I made it clear a 5 seater is absolutely no good.

Eventually 2 days later I get a call from Europcar to say a 7 Seater VW MULTIVAN GL74 VWY is available for me to collect. Went and collected and been smooth ever since.

Driving home today 27/01/2025 and the vehicle (VW MULTIVAN GL74 VWY) started to smell of burning and then suddenly a large warning triangle saying HAZARD: FIRE, the vehicle hit the brakes by itself and came to a complete stop shutting everything down and called the Fire Service out. The Fire Service inspected and agreed it stunk of fire burning ect and advised me to not drive it any further. I call the Coventry Europcar Branch to make them aware of the situation and the guy was not interested and said call RAC, spent ages trying to connect with RAC whom could not find the details, in the end after I did some digging Myself, it was the AA who needed to be called so i was provided with the wrong information.

The AA contractor Elite Recovery Midlands have just arrived and have immediately deemed the vehicle unfit and unsafe to drive from what they have seen and inspected at 21:06pm on 27/01/2025 I have the breakdown report, would you like me to post this report all over your sites to show you up and show everyone your lack of care to your customers, my children was in this vehicle and look what could of potentially gone wrong. vehicle ready to be recovered from my home on 28/01/2025

The stress you have caused me and the danger you have put my children in with your dodgy vehicle

Now trying to locate another 7 seater and the Coventry Europcar Branch are refusing to help and his words was (not my problem) so I called the main Europcar number and they have also been very unhelpful and said nothing they can do.

The person at the Europcar Coventry UK, his customer service and attitude is disgusting</div>

                <div class='text'>Terrible experience. Booked a car to be delivered to my house at 9 o'clock. Hadn't arrived by 10 and noticed I had been sent an email to say it had been cancelled. Contacted their reservations/customer services team and spoke to at least 7 or 8 different people. None of them was able to help and told me to contact the Enfield office who were dealing with the booking. Was on hold for over 30 mins trying to get through to Enfield office before giving up. Tried reservations line again and explained car needed urgently to attend close family funeral, still no-one helped and two people refused to put me through to a manager to try to resolve. Gave up in the end and got the train . Will never trust Europcar again, They messed up by renting me a car which they didn't have, their communication was non-existent (if they needed to cancel my booking at short notice someone should have at least rung me to confirm I had got the message) and the customer services were unable/unwilling to help me even though I explained the significant inconvenience they had caused me. Suggest using any other car hire company than these as surely the others don't treat their customers this badly?

UPDATE: Following Europcar's response asking me to 'give them chance to resolve the issue', I have just received a standard response saying they didn't have an available cars and I will be refunded and to accept their apologies. Nothing about their appalling level of customer care, no acknowledgement of the huge inconvenience caused, no gesture of goodwill. Suggest avoiding using this company as if anything goes wrong they will do the bare minimum to resolve the issue.</div>

                <div class='text'>Booked Mercedes A class arrived to find didn’t have so getting ‘free upgrade’ to …. a Nissan? Queried to be told I was getting bigger car, an SUV, so it was an upgrade. Advised it was just me so didn’t want an SUV as driving 500 miles would rather the premium brand for comfort. Told they had other Mercedes but they don’t give them for one way rentals (charged extra £78 for one way) so it was take the Nissan or nothing.

In addition to drivers licence, DVLA share code and credit card all which was expected, I was then required to provide a passport (provided UK licence) and then told they would do a credit check - don’t know if checking for bankruptcy, CCJ or credit limit to value of vehicle?

Won’t be using Europcar again

                <div class='text'>If I could give them ZERO stars, I would. We booked a car online (medium sized) via Booking.com
When we arrived (jet lagged & exhausted after the long flight from Australia), the guy said that the car we had booked wouldn't serve our purposes as we were doing a lot of driving. As per another review, you're a target because you're tired and you just want to get a car and get going.
Long story short: we ended being "upgraded" (supposedly at some discounted cost), but out of pocket an extra GBP1400!! In hindsight, my husband made the observation that when we were talking to the guy about our booking, he had 3 sets of keys in front of him. We figure (in hindsight), that one set was the car we actually booked, the second was a slight upgrade and the third was the set for suckers like us. And, like another reviewer, the upsell about insurance: no, what we had paid for online was not of any use, blah, blah. Then, when we finally get out to the car and ask for some help with how it all operates , they send out some young guy who knew little more than us. We got absolutely NO help working out how to get the GPS to work - when you put in an intended address, after a minute the screen would disappear and the message would come up, something along the lines of "You need to pay a subscription". What??? After a week of using our own data on our 'phones due to this limitation (and stopping in at two more car hire offices to try and get help with it, without success), we discovered if we went through another field/screen, the map displayed would actually stay live and not disappear. Fancy having to work that out for yourself, and having the frustration of that limitation for a week, when the company can't help you. (No car manual in the car).
Also, like other reviewers, I WISH I HAD READ THESE REVIEWS BEFORE BOOKING!! Additionally, in talking to a friend, she had the same type of pressure to upgrade (although she stuck to her guns) with this company in NEW ZEALAND. This must be part of their policy and company training!! Maybe they get commission if they upsell?
Would NEVER rent through them again.</div>

                <div class='text'>In response to my previous review of Europcar they gave me their standard response/ solution "please contact our service department".
They simply ignore that I am talking by phone and email for now 4 Months to their "service department bureauocracy".
In fact that department act as a defence to providing any service at all! We have to stop this.
I am sure their response automat will again "advise me to contact their service department".
What a company! Can this be stopped!!

Please look at the response by Europcar. It's as expected and presume a robot response.
No possibility to talk with real persons with a mandate to really be of help.
Asking for a supervisor is also useless..</div>

We reserved a car on 24th Dec 2024, and paid for it to be picked up at Innsbruck airport. When we reached at the airport pick up the Austiran team told us we have not paid so we paid again.
In our back statements, we can clearly see two transections paid to Europcar but the customer service is only talking about taking and releasing our deposit.
This company is fraud as they charge customer twice without even giving an explanation.</div>

                <div class='text'>I had a terrible experience at the branch in Maidstone on 23rd January 2025. My car, booked for 8:00 AM, wasn’t ready, and I was told I’d have to wait until 3:00 PM. The excuse? I booked the night before after closing—which the system allowed without warning.

After waiting nearly an hour, they tried to upsell me a replacement car for £20 more per day. I refused, and the manager eventually approved it at no extra cost, but I was then charged £12–£13 daily for insurance instead. Adding to the chaos, payment delays due to system issues made the process feel rushed and unprofessional.

My order number was 1185232517. This experience was stressful, disruptive, and unacceptable. I wouldn’t recommend this branch.</div>

                <div class='text'>Our experience with Europcar turned out to be the most expensive and frustrating car rental we've ever had.

We chose Europcar because their website advertised the Volvo C40. However, upon arrival, the promised car was unavailable. The pick-up process was extremely slow, taking about an hour just to verify ID and address. This delay forced us to reschedule our plans, turning an already busy day into a stressful nightmare.

Throughout the process, we felt bombarded with additional charges. They attempted to add fees for a "popular pickup location," premium protection, and even cleaning—despite us already paying for extensive protection coverage.

Here are some of the key issues we faced:

1. The verification procedure took about an hour. This unnecessary delay disrupted our schedule and caused significant stress.

2. As advised, we paid extra premium protection for the alternative car, thinking it was only a day of use and a premium service would give us ease of mind.

3. While some loose dog hair ended up on our coats and my wife’s trousers, it was minimal. Despite this, Europcar insisted on specialist cleaning, claiming it was required for such a minor issue. We know firsthand that dog hair can be removed quickly with a vacuum and they provide standard cleaning for customers—it certainly doesn’t justify specialist cleaning fees. Plus we used other rental services and this was never an issue

4. The rental was advertised at approximately £120, yet by the end, we were charged over £200 for just one day of use. We ultimately had to involve Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) to contest the cleaning fee.

Regardless of the ADR outcome, we will never use Europcar again and strongly advise others to avoid their service. Renting from Europcar resulted in wasted time, unexpected stress, and substantial additional costs. And please save your reply by saying we need to send an email to your customer service team. We just got their reply. They said it was the final decision to use specialist cleaning service to remove some loose dog hair.</div>

I was told that the van was full of fuel and on its return it should be fully refuelled. This I did but I was still charged £6.26. Although the sum is small I went back to the operations manager and told him that he signed off the van as being fully fuelled. He said it was a mistake and Europcar would repay me shortly. They haven't. (I have seen similar things, on other rentals abroad but expected better here)</div>

                <div class='text'>I have hired with Europcar and l can definitely say they are a fraudulent company. Whenever l do an extension they will tell me a certain amount and guess what that’s not the actually amount they will then charge double that amount and say it’s for taxes and fees. I advise you all if you hire with this company don’t extend your reservation. When you call customer service they won’t help and say it’s taxes and fees etc. why not tell customers the full amount instead of leaving out about more than 50% extra charges that come with extending</div>

                <div class='text'>Was falsely charged two fees; one for a delay returning the car which was caused by Europcar taking TWO hours to return a call for extending the rental - a call that they said would be "within 15 minutes". Then they added on an extra day rental for 53 minutes late return when it was due to their own delay in calling me.

I suspect the delay in call back was in order to force the delay and make the extra charge. Very suspicious.

They then refused to remove that price with a customer service agent who presumably was provided by Little Britain.

In addition, there was a hidden charge for a "premium" drop-off location, which was not in the original agreement or detailed at collection.

I'll soon to be making my feelings clear to over five million users on social media.

Avoid this misleading, fraudulent company which does not value customers and would rather charge for a 53-minute delay in which THEY caused.

You should, though, perhaps also feel bad for Europcar because they are so desperate for money they insist on charging £25 incorrectly than settle this issue.

* Edit: Europcar have responded to this review informing me to contact customer service. Which I have already done. And which they would already know if they had read my review. Further compounding their uselessness by proving they literally do not listen to what the customer has said.</div>

                <div class='text'>We hired a car for 2 days from Europcar at Carcassonne Airport.
On returning it, the check-in reviewer said there was a scratch underneath the front valance which was not on the pre-stated damage.
This cannot even be seen from eye level or even parallel to the front valance so we could never have seen this when inspecting to verify before the hire.
Their staff appear to be running sharp practice to maximise ‘damage costs’ and potentially to improve their bonuses.
I would absolutely advise anyone taking one of their vehicles on hire to carefully inspect and video all around the immediate underside of the car to protect themselves.
However, I’d much more specifically suggest that people rent from an alternative provider who does not operate on an ethically dubious manner.

                <div class='text'>I recently booked a van with Europcar for a 6:00 PM collection, but my experience was highly disappointing due to miscommunication and poor service.

I called the branch Trafford Park to inform them I would be about 10 minutes late for the collection. Initially, I was told there would be an additional charge if the van was booked out after 6:00 PM, which I reluctantly agreed to. However, I was then informed that the system does not allow bookings after 6:00 PM, contradicting the earlier statement. This lack of clarity and inconsistency was incredibly frustrating.

My booking was accepted for 6:00 PM, which should mean I can collect the van at that time. When I questioned why it was even possible to book for 6:00 PM if collection wasn't allowed, I was told that attempts had been made to contact me throughout the day and that my phone went to voicemail. This was completely false—my phone was on, operational, and I received no missed calls or voicemails. Being provided with such incorrect information only added to my disappointment.

This was my first time using Europcar, and unfortunately, it has left a very poor impression. The repeated misinformation and lack of accountability suggest a lack of professionalism and integrity. If this is indicative of their standard practice, I find it deeply concerning.

Overall, my experience with Europcar was unsatisfactory, and I am unlikely to use their services again unless significant improvements are made. I cannot recommend them based on this encounter.</div>

When I went to pick up the car, I was told I failed the checks because I used my company card.

                <div class='text'>Fraud!! What a complete scam at the check in desk. I reserved a car with easycar and paid for an additional driver, and standard insurance. At the Europcar collection desk they offered me the insurance upgrade and I declined, so they said how about instead of the additional driver charge I give you the full insurance so your total costs is almost the same. Sure ok that's a good deal to me. To my surprise when I return and review my credit card bill I have 2 charges. 1 from easycar and 1 from Europcar, total 400 more than the price I signed up for when I booked. What a scam. I am disgusted. At least the other rental companies I have used from Manchester airport have never done anything like this.

Updated in response to your comment below: I had raised it on email already and it remains unresolved. You informed me to go speak to EasyCar about the additional driver charge, which indicates your guy had no authority to do what he did and say 'how about we waive the additional driver charge and use that to top up the insurance instead'. Complete scam, I have contacted the bank re unauthorsied charges on my CC. You shouldn't be allowed to operate like this. It's theft.

By the way, did you know that Trust Pilot can actually connect you with me if you really want to resolve it. I guess so.</div>

                <div class='text'>My ex wife booked a hire car from the branch in Middlesbrough for collection at 1pm on Saturday. We arrived at 1:30 and the place was closed. No notification during booking process to say the place closed at 1pm. No calls from the branch to ask if she was still collecting the car. Went to branch first thing today and they had hired out the SUV she booked so could only collect a Fiat 500 this morning. No offer of refund for the two days lost or a reduction for hire of a smaller car. Branch basically said it was her fault for not collecting it at 1pm on Saturday. Terrible customer service.</div>

                <div class='text'>After a smooth trip and returning my rental car, I thought everything was sorted. But a week later, I received an email from Europcar informing me of a £35 fine, along with a £45 administrative fee. I immediately paid the fine and sent the proof of payment to Europcar, believing the issue would be resolved. However, much to my frustration, I received a generic email stating that the £45 fee would be charged regardless, even though I had resolved the fine myself, with no intervention required from Europcar.

After leaving a review describing this absurd experience, Europcar responded with a standard message:

“Give us the chance to solve the issue by providing more details using this link, where our customer service team will be in touch.”

But here’s the truth: this is the same canned response Europcar sends to every complaint. It seems like an attempt to publicly appear responsive, but in reality, they simply do not reply to emails. I followed their instructions, submitted my information, and waited patiently. Days passed, and I received no response, no follow-up, and no resolution – just silence.

It’s clear that this automatic response is nothing more than an attempt to create the illusion of addressing complaints. I wouldn’t be surprised if most customers, like me, never hear back. Europcar appears more interested in maintaining a façade of good customer service than actually providing it.

This experience has only deepened my disappointment with Europcar. Charging an unfair fee is bad enough, but ignoring customers who seek solutions is even worse.

Conclusion: Europcar, your practices are unfair, and your lack of commitment to customer satisfaction is glaringly obvious. To anyone reading this: if you value your money and your peace of mind, avoid this company. I will never rent from Europcar again.</div>

Europa left car on Friday when they had arranged Saturday.
I went out,started it up,absolutely horrendous stink.Mechanic next door says clutch has burned out,only just over 2 months old.I Rang Europa cars 4 times this morning,each time they said someone was coming out.Failing to inform us they close at 1pm Saturdays.
They are disgusting.They knew they closed at 1,but kept us hanging on anyway.
I have an autistic disabled son and they left us high and dry.

Comes to 12 45,I rang AA who were brilliant,says Europa cars have account with AA who are now coming out to look at car,a Hyundai.Europa cars will have to pay.
Europa told us yesterday they will collect curtesy car at 9am today.Its 11 30 and after 3 calls saying they will ring us when they are collecting,still nothing.
it's a very frustrating procedure to even get through to right department.
Leave keys under plant pot was suggested..oh my goodness,I would never use this company again.It was only through AA we found ourselves using them.
Nowadays no one seems to care.</div>

                <div class='text'>After posting a review on Trustpilot, I was invited to “give us the chance to solve the issue by providing more details.” I hope this email outlines my concerns clearly and helps you understand the level of disappointment I feel regarding my experience.

I booked a van online on 8th January, specifically requesting an early pick-up at 7 am. I paid an additional fee for this time slot as I needed to meet a strict schedule to offload at an exhibition. The payment was processed successfully, However, I never received an email confirmation. Fortunately, I took a screenshot of the transaction, which I have attached for your reference.

The day before the pick-up, I contacted customer services to confirm my reservation and was assured that my booking had been processed and the van would be ready at 7 am the next day.

On the day of collection, I arrived at the Enfield branch promptly at 7 am, only to find the branch closed. I waited outside until someone eventually arrived at 8 am – an hour later than expected.

I explained to the staff member that I had booked a van for 7 am, only to be told that "this never happens." Eventually, I was given two options: continue with the booking and contact customer services later or cancel the reservation and rebook on the spot. Already behind schedule due to the delay, I chose to continue with the booking.

The issues didn’t end there. I was provided with a van but had to wait for the windscreen to clear as the branch had run out of de-icer. Adding to my frustration, the van’s dashboard display did not clearly indicate how much fuel was available. This only became a problem during drop-off when I was informed that I needed to refill the tank. I incurred an additional cost of £35 for refuelling, which seemed excessive given the distance I had driven.

Throughout the day, I attempted to contact customer services. On my first call, the agent hung up on me. On my second attempt, I was told there was nothing that could be done.

In summary, I am deeply disappointed with this entire experience. From the lack of professionalism displayed by your staff to the failure to provide basic services (such as having the van ready at the booked time), every aspect of this booking was poorly handled.

Furthermore, the additional £35 refuelling fee and the absence of any apology or meaningful resolution from customer services have left me questioning your commitment to customer satisfaction. I expect a full refund of the additional costs incurred, along with an explanation of how you intend to prevent such issues from happening in the future.

This is the response I got from Customer services.
Thank you for contacting Europcar customer services in regards to the reservation xxxxxx and for taking the time to share your experience with us.

I truly apologise for the frustration and disappointment you encountered during your recent rental. I fully understand the impact that these issues have had on your schedule, and I am genuinely sorry for the inconvenience caused.

I deeply regret that the van was not ready at the agreed time, and I recognise the importance of punctuality, especially when you had a tight schedule to meet. I also apologise for the lack of acknowledgment from our staff and the difficulties you faced with the windscreen and fuel gauge. This is certainly not the level of service we aim to provide.

I am pleased to inform you that I have refunded the extra 60 GBP fee you paid for the early 7:00 am pick-up. The refund has been processed and should appear in your account up to 10 working days.

Please know that your feedback is important to us, and we are taking it seriously. We are reviewing our processes to ensure this kind of situation does not happen again in the future.

Once again, I apologies for the inconvenience and stress this caused, and I truly appreciate your patience throughout this matter. If you need any further assistance or have additional questions, please do not hesitate to reach out. I am here to help.

Regards,

Europcar UK Group | Customer Services</div>

                <div class='text'>My parents booked a car for us via a third party to collect from Manchester airport. From the outset it felt like an elaborate scam.

Even though my dad had plaid for excess protection via the third party we were told it wouldn't cover it and we needed to pay again.

Nobody showed me around the car at pickup. I was just left to work it all out at 5am after a 27 hour flight.

Then there were endless additional changes for this 'premium location', non of which were communicated in advance.

Upon return we were charged over $100NZD to vacuum a little bit of dirt off the rear mats (this was a two week hire and my kids had been careful... It was honestly nothing that a regular between-hire clean would need to deal with)

Over a month later I'm still trying to get back the remainder of my security deposit.

Avoid this business

EDIT:

The canned response below (the same one added to every negative review here) offers me the chance to contact customer services. I already have done this. I've written multiple emails, lodged a complaint, all to no avail. Charges were upheld and nothing more done except empty 'apologies'.

The litany of poor reviews here repeat the same issues and experience that I had. No action seems to be taken to improve things, so I reiterate: Avoid them.</div>

                <div class='text'>Ohhh I totally agree with all of these reviews! Shocking. I have been waiting since Friday 10th for a mobility car to replace mine whilst it's fixed. I was told Sat 11th in the afternoon (no show) I have constantly been calling with no response. Then without my knowledge it was booked for Monday 13th Jan, once again no show and no contact. Then again booked without my knowledge for today 16th Jan and again a no show. I have tried again to contact Stockport branch to no answer again. This is a mobility car for a disabled person. Not good this is it. I do not recommend these at all. I am also recommending that disability remove them from supplying them cars or should I say not supplying cars. There are better hire car agencies out there. I doubt my review with get published thats why I'm going on to trust pilot next. Not happy at all.</div>

Ref - 22168688 - STILL NO REPLY FROM EUROPCAR OVER 18 DAYS ON.
Please do not hire a car with Europcar. They are unable to deal direct with people, everything is autogenerated, as you will see from the responses they give to people on here. Despite them giving you a link to send your query - they do not reply. No news still from 30th Dec. Offices are closing down over the UK and they do not give clients notice, so on the day of collecting you arrive to an empty office and they have already taken your money. PLEASE DO NOT HAND OVER MONEY TO EUROPCAR. Wait for the generic response to my review. Look at the responses they send... all the same, sent by robots!!! Frightening this company is allow to trade.</div>

                <div class='text'>Avoid this company like the plague.
I arrived and they told me the only car they had was an Audi, of a higher level than what I already paid for. I found out that they charged me extra for the upgraded car when they supposedly didn't have the car level I pre-purchased. And upgrade should be free when they don't have the car you paid for. They refused to refund me the extra amount and we're very rude. In addition, the windshield fluid pump didn't work and the tires were bald.

UPDATE: After the company reached out to me for my review above, I filed my complaint through their processeses... THEY STILL are making me pay the extra fro the upgrade when they did not have the car I reserved. AVOID THEM></div>

                <div class='text'>Horrendous experience

Took over £200 for a booking online, then the branch called me a few minutes after and said they couldn't honour it as they didn't have the cars. End result: I'm waiting for the refund to be given to me and in the meantime I can't afford another booking as they are sitting on the money. I'm utterly stranded.

It's hard to imagine how they could have screwed me over any more spectacularly.

Avoid like the plague.

UPDATE: like everyone else with a negative experience they try to get you to contact them. I did and have heard nothing back... like everyone else. If you live near Stoke on Trent / Stafford, use Afford. I did and the difference in customer care was astonishing.</div>

But few weeks later I got physical mail about the fine under my name this time. It was 35£. Turns out the 45£ I paid to the Europcar is administration fee EXCLUDING the actual fee.

                <div class='text'>Europcar have billed me 15 000 pounds for damages - I only had the van for about half an hour
---------
I first realised something was seriously wrong when waiting at traffic lights on Park Road in Portsmouth and I could see smoke coming from the van. This was about half an hour after picking up the van in Southampton.
Almost immediately after picking the van up, the accelerator started whirring (as a result of a radio program, when I heard someone mention that this sound can result from a broken turbocharger, I questioned whether the van was turbocharged but received no reply).
The van had stalled about 10 times on the way (but obviously not on the motorway which makes up the bulk of the distance)
It was my intention to turn off Park Road at the bottom (which you used to be able to do - I had done this in the opposiute direction only recently) but I soon found out that that was no longer possible. It is hard to say because I no longer live in Portsmouth but presumably there were signs indicating that after crossing the traffic lights the only option was to enter Gunwharf Quays (several hundreds of metres away), but I was distracted by the smoke (which I only slowly realised was coming from my van)
You would not expect such a thing to happen to a rental vehicle only half an hour after you had picked it up
Inexorably I was drawn into Gunwharf Quays, into the underground car park. There appeared to be no obvious 'escape routes' and when I hit the height restriction sign there was no obvious way out (all this was happening while I was being distracted by a van that could, for all I knew, burst into flames at any moment'). By this time I was half underground, with a queue of traffic behind me - it would have seemed likely to me that was still an 'escape route' moving forward (which is the only way I could go), until I hit something. I am still not 100% certain what I hit - it was not a low roof or anything like that which would have been obvious to see coming.
It seems strange to me to be only told about height restrictions when it is too late to do anything about it.
I had no option but to go backwards, under guidance from staff, and then parked up about 50 metres away, after being sent down an unmarked 'escape route' leading to the shops. That was when I called the AA because of the smoke
The AA man just made some claims that I must have been riding the clutch and then let me go. I then left to go to Western Parade
After loading up, the van limped about 30 metres before coming to a stop and refusing to re-start. I then called the AA for a second time
After coming to the conclusion that the clutch was burnt out, this second AA man was with me for about 3 hours and arranged the consequences. The van was taken away by Boarhunt. Europcar paid for a hotel room for the night
Problems
Right from the beginning, Europcar have claimed that the AA only attended once. But this is illogical. The van was not taken away after this first AA visit at between 11 and 12 in the morning and it was not taken away from Gunwharf Quays. It was taken away about 11 hours later from Duisburg Way which is about 2 km away.
The clutch had gone and this was unlikely to have resulted from the actions of any driver within half an hour.
They seem to imply that I picked up the van from Southampton and then within half an hour I had not only reached Portsmouth but had loaded the back of the van completely with my worldly goods.
It is not good service to have problems within half an hour of taking possession
Personal Consequences
Extra expenditure to me was around 800 pounds. But after they announced on Friday that they were not going to supply a replacement van, I decided to travel up to Liverpool and arrange things at my new flat. Unfortunately I couldn't find anywhere to stay on the Saturday so I had to spend the night in a local park, an experience I hope to never repeat (this was a night when I should have been spending my second night in my flat). This experience almost trumps the loss of money</div>

I am currently waiting on a response from Europcar and will be filing a dispute with my bank. It is about time VISA/Mastercard start to clamp down on this industry where such unscrupulous practices are far too prevalent.

Edit: Europcar has now offered to refund the charges, as a gesture of goodwill.👏</div>

                <div class='text'>I booked a van for the day and arranged 5 separate collections from people from various locations across the area.
I arrived at the collection point and there was no van. The tracker showed it to be stationary 20 miles away. I rang customer services and was fobbed off by the agent. He told me that GPS isn't accurate and it might be around the corner, if I wait.
I waited, it didn't arrive. GPS showed it hadn't moved.
I rang again and this time a helpful agent actually told me it had been taken off the road the previous day. She then spend another 20 minutes or do trying to locally locate a replacement van but none were available but at least she tried.
I then gave up and did the collections individually in my own car. It took longer but it was less stressful.
I later provided them with every single detail of this encounter to them via https:/ www europcar co uk/contact-us/email but got nothing back.
If the reply to this review asking me to do it again, then we all can assume that it is a non caring, company policy following media representative replying. Or an AI bot.
Disappointing, very disappointing.

Update...
So they did answer with their standard fob off reply.
I'm guessing that they really don't care about short rentals so I wouldn't bother if I were you.</div>

                <div class='text'>What a terrible experience from start to finish. And even after numerous attempts to contact the customer support, there has been NOTHING.

Would definitely not be recommending them to anyone. Much better to use Avis or Enterprise if you are in the UK.

Please do not ask me to contact you because I HAVE DONE ON MANY OCCASIONS and NOTHING!</div>

                <div class='text'>After 4 (!) Months Europcar is up to today chasing me for a "roadside incident that never happened"!
I told them numerous times they mixed it with an "incident" for which they compensated me with apologies!
I had more than 20 (!) phone calls always with different people, and more than 25 (!) emails, also always different people who start the case all over again.
I had to explain every time new what their mistake is.
Still they are coming back at me even after 4 Months silence...
Their burocracy is obviously a big mess. Kafka revisited.
I presume I will have to seek legal support to stop this.</div>

                <div class='text'>AVOID THIS COMPANY
I hired a car for 2 days from Alicante aiport. On the morning I was meant to return the veichle and catch my flight back to the UK, there was a problem with my fob key. It was completley
dead, I couldn't start the car. It was 3.30 in the morning. I was now panicking as I had a flight to catch. Eventually myself and family managed to get a taxi. I dropped the key back to the office but with no time to call the 24 hr breakdown line. The office still closed. I nearly missed my flight, it was very stressful.
As soon as I landed back in UK, I called europcar to explain the situation. Worst Customer service they were so unorganised and unhelpful. I had no apology for the inconvenience. To my horror I then get a email invoice to say that they were charging me another €180 for breakdown recovery and a surcharge. This is utterly unacceptable. This was through no fault of my own. They should be compensating me! I only hired the veichle for 2 day. Costing my a whopping €200 euro with fully comprehensive insurance, which I assumed would cover you for any breakdown during your rental. I would advise anyone to never use this company utterly apporling treatment.</div>

                <div class='text'>The worst, utterly disgraceful, experience I've ever had hiring a car. I booked a manual for two days, went to collect it from the Victoria London branch. I mentioned I only needed it for one day but had to book it for two as there was no mention online I could drop it off after hours on the day I needed it. The manager told me I could have booked it for one day. As compensation, as he added he couldn't change the booking in his system (???) so he offered to upgrade me to an automatic for free so long as I dropped it off by Saturday 1pm. I agreed, signed the form and returned the car full of petrol by 1pm Saturday. I then received notification from my bank that I'd been charged two days using an automatic, plus two days insurance. I called Europcar customer service to complain. They told me as I signed the contract there was nothing they could do. Plus they refused to put me through to the Victoria branch manager or put me through to their senior manager to raise the complaint. Incensed, I then went to the Victoria Europcar shop to explain to the manager the booking error. He wasn't there. I went again and again and again, three times he still wasn't there. These three times I explained to the Victoria staff in the manager's absence the mishap that had happened. Each time the staff I spoke to told me they'd get the manager to call me to sort out the mis-booking. The manager never called me. The fourth time I arrived at the Victoria branch, the manager was finally there, but kept me waiting 1/2hr before he turned up to talk to me. He looked surprised at my appearance and said he'd heard nothing about my complaint from any of his staff or customer services. The staff member behind me, who I'd met the day before and who'd promised to pass on my message, put his head in his hands. We knew perfectly well the manager was lying. He then told me I was lying and had made this whole thing up. He said he never offered me a free upgrade to an automatic from a manual car. He added, as I'd signed the contract my complaint meant nothing. But the contract I signed was misleading. The sum for £164 was black bold with lots of small type around it. This amount sounded about right for a 2 day manual hire including insurance I'd agreed to add on to the initial £115 fee. Not the £320 that was actually deducted from my bank account for a two day automatic hire. The manager walked off dismissing me. I called Europcar customer service again to complain. Three times the Europcar customer service put the phone down on me. I can't tell you how unjust, dishonest, disgraceful and unsettling this experience has been. I will never hire a Europcar EVER again.</div>

Rang to book a van, arranged for Saturday morning, they called to see if I can pick up Friday instead as they were not equipped for the Saturday, got dropped off on Friday eve to pickup and it wasn’t the van I wanted, they said they don’t even do the van I wanted so I decided to take it, paid and signed, went to get it out the yard and it wasn’t a ex hire from motorway maintenance, dirty in the back with tonnes of racking, went back in to get a refund and was made to walk back in -3 weather for 5 mile, shocking</div>

                <div class='text'>In mid December I hired an economy vehicle (Corsa sized) with Europcar. At the east London branch I was given a large SUV sized vehicle (I didn’t know the size of it at the desk - an MG HS). During the rental I unfortunately kerb damaged an alloy wheel due to the size of the vehicle. On return the branch was closing and staff advised me to use the drop box which I did. The next day I was charged £70 for early return of the vehicle, on complaining Europcar said they would refund the amount due to an error. Am still awaiting the refund. With regard to the alloy wheel damage, Europcar three weeks on have yet to provide an invoice for the damage in order for me to raise an external insurer claim. Attempting to contact Europcar at a UK office is impossible via telephone and emails are replied to in a generic fashion with no attempt made in resolving issues by their staff. Overall experience is dreadful. Am genuinely sad for Europcar in the UK as I have used them for 6 years previously and found their service fair, even when minor damage has happened.</div>

                <div class='text'>Initially they were very quick in finding a hire car while my motability car was being repaired but the car offered was not quite suitable for my wife's need. I rung countless times to be told I need to speak to either motability team or the local station. I speak to the motability team and they say they escalate it to Europcar who I assume passed it on to the local station. I cannot get through to the local station, and they have not contacted me at all. This has been going on for 4 weeks now. Luckily my dealer gave us a courtesy car for the first 7 weeks but had to return because they were selling it so it could have been even worse. I've had no help from costumer support as yet either. We won't be hiring a car from them again that's for sure.</div>

Hired a Compact car from Europcar at Heathrow. It broke down 2 hours after collection. The AA recovery could not start the car and it was eventually towed away.

I was left without the offer of any replacement car. After spending the whole day on the phone, receiving contradictory advice from every person I spoke to, I eventually got offered a replacement car 48 hours later.

The replacement car was a Mini size.

In my final invoice, I was charged the full price of the Compact and no accounting for the missing 2 days.

                <div class='text'>Glasgow airport, Europcar and Euan the grinning con artist.

What did we rent?
My mom and I rented a Fiat 500 via a trusted German website costing us exactly EUR 175. Insurance and everything is covered by the broker. We just wanted to pick up our rental.

What happened?
At the Europcar counter we were greeted by Euan (or Ewan). He seemed like one chirpy Scotsman. To our delight he upgraded us "free of charge". What an amazing guy! We couldn't believe our luck. He said, "you definitely need something bigger where you are headed and I have just the car".

There was no mention of additional costs whatsoever.
Who wouldn't like a free upgrade when they're headed into the Scottish outback?

Some papers were elegantly shuffled around, we were told to sign here, here and here. After that we had to pop our card into the machine for the deposit and it was a done deal. Only it wasn't.

The trickery and the damage.
The upgrade was not free of charge and the additional cost of the rental was £171.86 or EUR 205. EXTRA! That's more than the initial rental booking. Both numbers look extremely similar by the way. When we inserted our card for the deposit, we in fact paid for the upgrade. That was NEVER mentioned to us. We also never paid for a deposit, which is utterly bizarre. The kicker is that we didn't receive an end of rental statement either. Also, the charge for the upgrade was not taken out until 2 weeks after the rental (06/11/24). So even if we had paid with Monzo, which shows charges instantly we would not have realised it then and there at the counter.

Of course we signed the papers and that's enough for Europcar. Why would they care? Their golden boy Euan is ripping off people by the planeloads making the rental car company a F-ton of extra money. Unfortunately our broker nor our bank couldn't help, but that's not the end of it. A quick Google search reveals that this isn't Euan's first con nor that Europcar will ever see the promised land.

BEWARE: Euan is a smirking bastard who is out to get you. Be it extra insurance you don't need or "free" upgrades.

PLEASE read what you sign.

FURTHER ACTION will be taken via BVRLA.

If you read this and were scammed as well please take action. Do not let them get away with this. We will create a case and if necessary hire a lawyer collectively. Please get in touch.

                <div class='text'>Regrettably Preston Europcar branch has defaulted to the expected level of Europcar Customer Service. Non existant.
How can my booking be accepted, check-in offered online and no car be available on arrival at the branch?
An email was sent after my reservation was confirmed advising there were no cars available but efforts were ongoing to get vehicles back as quickly as possible. I was advised not to go to the branch until I was contacted by a colleague. Unable to contact anyone at the Preston branch and in the absence of the promised phone call with 2 hour journey by public transport to the branch, I contacted the Europcar Call centre two times. I was advised my reservation had not been cancelled and to proceed to the branch as my reservation was good.
On arrival at Preston lots of cars in the parking lot but no car for me.
When in the branch and in the presence of a staff member I went on the Europcar App and was able to make and confirm another booking for the same afternoon with a 5pm pickup
How can this be possible?
Surely booking engines should have sales inhibited by the branch if there is no car availability to avoid messing supposedly valued customers around.
Privilege status is worth nothing.
Europcar do not value your repeat business and clearly have no respect for their customers.
On the bus home. 4 hours wasted, £11.50 out of pocket and the lovely job of explaining to an 88 year old lady why we can't visit relatives tomorrow morning.
Thanks Europcar.</div>

                <div class='text'>We got tricked and scammed by Euan at Europcar Glasgow Airport without any refund in sight after two objections were filed!
I always book a rental car via a German trustworthy platform to find the best deal with the best reviews to avoid scams.
We had a small car reserved but Euan at Glasgow Airport gave us a larger car without even mentioning extra costs! The writing on the rental agreement was so bad and resembled the amount in Euros I prepaid but was in fact the extra amount for the upgrade in GBP! Instead of 172.15 Euros, we paid £172 extra for the unsolicited upgrade. He shuffled the papers in front of us, no detailed explanation and we signed. I usually read every single line on these contracts but he had a talent to charm and con us into it.
When I entered the card into the card pay machine, I assumed it is for the deposit. We were not given any receipt for any transaction at any time, again, thinking it is for the deposit.
In the Europcar yard I realised that there were no small cars parked anywhere and again assumed that we got a larger one because they didn't have a small car available.
Only when I checked my bank account when we were back from Scotland, I realised that we got charged for the upgrade on top of the initial payment! A deposit was never taken out of the account. The fact that the money was only taken out of my account 2 weeks after the rental also shows that nothing was done by the book. If I had seen the amount on a receipt or in my transactions straight away, we could have turned on our heels. But if you get deceived in such a way, you don't expect bad intention. We also never received an end of rental statement via email as it usually is the case.
I filed two complaints with Check24, the German booking website, however, they closed the case twice after trying to solve the issue with Europcar.
This is not where it ends, Europcar. I'm taking this to the BVLRA for further investigation. It can't be the case that so many people get scammed by Europcar and get away with it.
And if you, Europcar, send an automated reply to this rating and how sorry you are about the experience, then do something about the scammers you employ at your rental desks.
This has to end!</div>

                <div class='text'>Summary: £54.86 overcharged for no reason

Explanation:
On 2 January 2025, I had booked to pick up an electric vehicle (EV) at 1:00 pm. However, upon arrival, the staff member seemed confused about my booking and initially provided me with a petrol car instead of the EV I had reserved. After realising the mistake, she had to swap the cars, causing a delay. As a result, I did not receive the car until 1:36 pm.
When I returned the car, I made sure it had a battery charge level of 55%. Yet, the invoice inaccurately claims that the charge level was only 42%.
The problems didn’t end there. On 7 January 2025, I noticed that £54.86 had been deducted from my deposit without any explanation or invoice. I contacted Europcar to inquire about this, but I have received no response.
This experience has left me deeply frustrated. Not only does Europcar fail to deliver accurate service, but they also show no regard for transparency or customer communication. If you rent from them, be prepared for false charges and the possibility of having to pursue legal action to recover your money. I will now be commencing legal proceedings to address this issue.

I strongly advise others to avoid Europcar entirely. This was one of the worst rental experiences I’ve ever had.</div>

                <div class='text'>Have rented with Europcar a few times and usually went smoothly until they rented me a car with a history of battery issues. I rented it for a specific occasion and it would not start and AA were hours away as it was safely parked on my driveway. I had to spend over £100 in taxis to get to my event. The next day the AA came out and said it was the 6th time they'd been out for the same car in 10 weeks and to take it straight back to Europcar. Despite numerous phone calls and emails, and proof of the problems from the AA, they have refused to offer any refund for the vehicle rental.

                <div class='text'>Not worthy of one star. Absolute diabolical, fraudulent service. I paid for a hire car on 9th Oct for hire on 30th December, from Warrington branch. I received a "your car is ready from Warrington branch" email at 8am on 30th Dec. I arrived at the branch - to find it had closed down months ago! I phoned customer service ( waited a long while and was charged a lot for a 0371 number). All the operator kept saying was "sorry", said there was no manager to talk to and id have to travel to Liverpool to collect a car, and take it back to Liverpool. We were due to leave on our holiday at 9.30am, my family were at home waiting. We had family we'd not seen for 20 years meeting us half way to our destination for lunch, which we didn't make and they've now returned to Canada. I was left in tears trying to get someone to help me. I had to get another car from a local car hire, which because of the late notice was twice as much. I still to this date have had no explanation or a phone call which I was promised. Europcar simply do not care. I've e-mailed, I tried to call, but not a single word back. I have no idea how Europcar are allowed to trade when they illegally sold me a service that did not exist and now I am £250 out of pocket, because of their error.</div>

                <div class='text'>Awful service from local Europcar.

Booked a vehicle twice three days apart. Both times cancelled.

Tried to call local Exeter Europcar on two occasions … did not answer phone ether time despite staying on ‘hold’ after being re-directed, stayed on phone a total of 30 mins. Later find out EE charge 50p/min when calling a 0371 number.

Extremely poor service + costly.</div>

                <div class='text'>Absolutely diabolical service. I paid for a hire car on 9th oct. Went to collect on 30th December and the Warrington branch had closed down. No one bothered to inform me. We lost a whole day of our holiday and missed a family gathering. The distress and upset caused by Europcar was appalling. Over a week later I still have had no contact from them. I will be taking this matter further as I was sold an agreement that didn’t exist! They even e mailed me at 8am on the 30th to tell me the car was ready at Warrington branch!!!</div>

                <div class='text'>I noticed, more than a month after my rental that this company (Manchester Airport Branch) had charged for damages without any notification.
After challenging this I received excuses like your email address was incorrect, strange given that they had emailed me the booking confirmation for the same when I booked it. They also sent photos of the supposed damage, of the wheel, which could have been from any car, it did not even give enough of an image to show it was even the same colour car, apparently you cannot show the damage without an extreme close up? Also increasing my frustration on this was that I had booked what was supposed to be one of their premium cars and to be frank it was a wreck which when I complained at pick up was told "its driveable so its rentable" and "if you want to replace the best we can provide you with is this car" a car which was not a "premium car" and not in any way the same size to accommodate our Luggage.
I would strongly recommend not to use this company, I certainly won't be doing again.
Update following response from Europcar
Thankyou for your prompt response however please note that I did not write this review immediately after the issue, I communicated via email with your Customer Services on various occasions and it was only after receiving unacceptable responses that I posted this review.</div>

                <div class='text'>Scammers at the desk Manchester Airport
BEWARE the scams at the desk and careful what you sign. I have my own excess insurance so I refused any additional cover but the clerk secretly added this to my documentation which I signed. Company refusing to refund and charged it after the rental was completed. The charge was more than that for the car rental and nearly £200! Use another company who is honest or takes scamming complaints seriously. Edit* Company have refused to refund or investigate. Have complained to the BVLRA</div>

                <div class='text'>I would give this company 0 stars if I could. I stupidly did not read reviews before booking and naively thought such a well known company would be better. I really just wanted to book a car for a week, pay for it, with the price quoted and safely drive to my destination. I was quoted £467 for a car for 1 week which I think is way too much anyway. After booking I rang customer service as a change in plans meant I needed an infant car seat for my 4 month old baby. This was completed over the phone, quote changed slightly. I rang and emailed customer services the day before travel and was reassured everything was as it should be. Imagine my surprise when I arrived and was told I did not have a car seat booked, just a device (apparently a legal requirement seeing as Italian people have a tendency to leave their children in cars!) So I was charged for a car seat. Then pressure sold insurance. My £467 escalated to £968 (including a £100 hold on my credit card). The rep at the desk then handed me the most disgusting, filthy car seat, absolutely not fit for a 4 month old and told us to go and find the car, with 2 suitcases, bags and a baby in a pushchair. Checked my credit card statement, final charge was £721.33 + £21.27 non sterling transaction fee 🤣.</div>

                <div class='text'>On Friday the 20th December of 2024 I booked a rental vehicle through the Easyjet website, collecting it from Europcar Manchester Airport at 3:00pm.

From the innumerous companies based in Manchester, I chose Europcar as it is a well-reputed company in the market, trustworthy and with relatively affordable prices.
According to the booking summary I did not contract any other services or extra options in addition to the car rental.

When collecting the vehicle the employee present at the time suggested me to upgrade my cover to a premium insurance, to which I said I was not interested.

Upon my answer, your employee gave me several documents to sign under the excuse they were mandatory to the conclusion of the rental contract.

The car was returned with a full tank, without any faults or damage, something that was checked by your staff at the time of delivery.

I was completely gobsmacked and furious when I received the invoice where you Europcar charged me almost double the amount that had been previously agreed.

I will bring again to your attention that I did not contract or subscribed to any extra services, neither at the time of booking nor at the time of collection.

After reading SEVERAL feedbacks from other dissatisfied customers on several internet pages, I can finally understand where the issue relies:
Because I refused the premium insurance, the employee took advantage of my apparent rush to collect the car keys and the fact that I was a foreigner and non English native, to give me the premium insurance contract to sign mixed up with other paperwork.

This is fraud, and you are accountable for it.

Unfortunately this situation, which is very difficult to prove, seems to be recurring and many customers were scammed in this way (you can find plenty similar cases here in Google Feedback, for example).

That said, my only question is:
Are your employees who, in search of commission money, deceive Europcar customers?
Or is Europcar the one encouraging employees to carry out this type of fraudulent scheme?
Until what extend are you as a company involved in this fraudulent scheme?

Either options are despicable and reprehensible.
Considering Europcar has been operating since 1949 and has a reputation to uphold, you should be ashamed of your employees actions and take responsibility for their misdeeds.

I expect nothing than a full refund covering the extra money that was abusively withdrawn from my account, and for the employees who have been carrying such fraud to be sanctioned and brought to justice.

I expect an answer from you within the next 15 days, and in the case of failure I will seek further action with legal authorities.
I will also report this matter to the GOV.UK, Trading Standards Institute and to the ECRCS.

You can fool me once, but you won't fool twice. As someone who travels to England twice a year, I will never use your services again, and I will make sure this situation is widely spread.</div>

                <div class='text'>Europcar are a bunch of sneaky money grabbing trickster thieves. They try and pressure people and scare them into spending more money on extras such as the premium protection cover which is nearly as much as the rental itself by imposing a disgraceful £1600 compulsory excess which leaves the customer no choice but to take the protection. I said i didn't want it but they then went and charged me for it anyway a week later thinking i wouldn't notice!!?? They also tried to get me to pay for fuel i might not need by trying to charge me for a full tank of fuel in advance. You say 'make sure its empty before you return it' so you expect the customer to just drive around aimlessly burning off fuel that they didn't need to pay Europcar for in the first place? They're basically a bunch of fraudulent con artists and their sneeky pressure tactics to get more money out of people is absolutely disgraceful.</div>

                <div class='text'>I was given a Europcar booking as a courtesy car when my personal car was hit. The Bermondsey Branch (my closest one) have been awful as they simply do not answer their phones.

                <div class='text'>Terrible experience - Europcar need to urgently update their t’s&c’s.

There is an undisclosed young drivers fee - the terms and conditions states “Under 25’s will face a young drivers fee”, which is the main reason why I booked the car with europcar, as I am 25 and this statement means I will not be charged any extra.

Unfortunately I was faced with an extra £590 fee for my car on arrival, when the car booking itself was only £390. The first line you see on the t’s and c’s is the above (quote - UNDER 25’s), and you have to “click to read more” to read further where you see the line, “25’s AND under will be charged” etc. Why would I click to read further if the first, summarised thing I read clearly states it is relevant for UNDER 25’s, not 25 AND under?

To add to this, the fee wasn’t added until I arrived to collect, so I also could not cancel my car. I was within the 6 hour pick up time and so I would have been charged the full fair. I was left with no option but to take the charge, all because of an error on their side. My £390 car turned into a £980 one!! Absolute rip off.

I feel I am entitled to a refund on this surcharge fee, and I would certainly not suggest Europcar to anyone.</div>

                <div class='text'>One star is too much for the service we got at London Heathrow. Rented a Seat, but as not availsble an MG was offeted at massiv extra costs, to which we erroneously agreed, as it‘s an english car we thought and told the guy. No word from him, correcting us that the car is not british. Next day, in the South of England, found out through AA that it is actually chinese crap we rented. For years now we refuse to buy or rent any chinese manufactured stuff. Experience showed us also this time, we are very right. Had to call AA twice and after a couple of hours drive our backpain was unbelievable too. Anyway, now we also refuse to rent from Europcar. Never ever again!</div>

                <div class='text'>EDIT:

Europcar's response below suggests the left-hand doesn't talk to the right. I HAVE BEEN TALKING TO Customer Services, and they won't do anything.

ORIGINAL:

I hired a van from the Wallisdown, Dorset branch, and the experience was nothing short of infuriating. Almost immediately after driving off, the door sensor alarm started blaring non-stop. No matter how many times I opened and closed the door, the alarm wouldn’t shut off. I was on a strict schedule, so I had no choice but to deal with the unbearable noise for the duration of my rental. I didn’t mention it right away, but when I returned the vehicle, I reported the issue, only to be told that because I had already checked the van back in, I would need to contact Head Office.

After numerous frustrating emails, Head Office’s response was to offer me a voucher for future use—as if I would ever consider renting from you again! To top it off, the voucher comes with the delightful note that I can't even use it to hire a van. How utterly ridiculous. The hours of distress caused by that incessant, faulty sensor left both myself and my passenger with searing headaches. As an act of goodwill, I’d expect at least some form of compensation, yet here I am, left with nothing but a sour taste in my mouth. You’ve completely failed to address the issue, and I won’t be returning.

And as a side note, I booked for a 2-day rental but returned the van after just one day. Yet, somehow, the staff "forgot" to inform me that the price wouldn't reflect a full refund, not even close to half the cost. It's shocking how careless and dishonest this entire experience has been.

BONUS ISSUE

Low Oil Sensor Warning: To make matters worse, the low oil sensor also activated during my rental. This raises serious concerns about the vehicle’s roadworthiness and the quality of maintenance checks your fleet undergoes before being rented out to customers.</div>

                <div class='text'>SCAM!
Coming to Italy to visit parents, my plane landed in late 4 hours, so the Europcar north office was already close already, They told me to go Terminal south, there was a guy that barely understand what he say, he ask me the rental contract that was already pay in advance in Italy for the whole week about 750 Euros. The Europcar guy ask me the credit card again, ID documents again, providing me a new paperwork and give me an equivalent vehicle. Arrived at the hotel. having look at the new documentation, I realize an extra £2000 on that agreement. So the next day I made a phone call to Europcar asking what was that amount? a guy provide me a new phone number for accounting assistance on that matter. So, the new person was explain me, that amount of £2000 was a deposit, nothing was charged, if vehicle is returned with full gas on it, and without any damage, I Have an executive plan with Europcar, renting vehicle since more than 20 years., after 2 days, the Volvo x60 they gave me, stop running, so I had to call the assistance. Assistance van of AA, comes to my hotel, the guy say car has a fault on the battery electronic, so he was able to start with a new battery, asking me to return the brake down vehicle to London (2 hours driving ) take another vehicle and going back to the hotel, with another substitutive car for another 2 hours of driving. I'm 80 year old, planning to spend Christmas time with my family, due my daughter was need to have a surgery on 26 dec. So was really not possible to do this for me. So the AA guy made a call to his friend, after 2 hours comes another AA person, with a compatible spare part. just for fix the issue temporally. Vehicle then start again., but I lost all the morning waiting for the repair with no more time to take my family at the shopping tour programmed. At the end of the week I returned the vehicle to Europcar. and back to my country. after few days I received on my email. an invoice and I WAS CHARGED FOR AN EXTRA £2000 !!!! REASON UPGRADED VEHICLE (that I didn't ask) and AIRPORT FEES???? Called my bank for block that charged, They couldn't do it. Called Europcar In italy, they couldn't do it! they say go to London and speak to the guy who made the paperwork??? I will call my ADVOCATE, this is a pure scam!, Vehicle was already pay in full in advance as I TRUST THEM, such disgraceful behavior! I will never back to this company anymore, I recommend. to any one instead TO TAKE A TAXI ! It will save you money and frustrations!</div>

                <div class='text'>Needed a family size car for Christmas as I only have a 2 seater, booked Europcar thinking that as they are an international company I wouldn’t have any issues. How wrong I was!
Booked on the 20th December and spoke to the branch who told me I would be getting a VW T-Roc delivered. Around an hour later they rock up with a dirty Skoda and when I asked where the VW was I was told that all their “good cars” went up to the airports on transporters for the Christmas rush and I could either take the Skoda or they could take it back to the branch and cancel the booking. Had I not needed it that night I would have definitely rejected it.
I get that the car was not filthy but when paying £400 of my hard earned cash I was expecting them to have at least whipped the hoover around it.
I have so far been offered a £30 refund, not even 10% of the cost! Absolute joke. I see from other reviews that they supply courtesy cars for the mobility scheme, fair enough - these people aren’t paying directly so should be happy with whatever they’re given but when you’re paying your own money it is just not good enough. Maybe Europcar should stick the government contracts instead of ripping individuals off!</div>

                <div class='text'>Europcar is an absolute disgrace. The young blonde boy serving us blatantly lied, claiming he was giving us an “extra nice car” without once mentioning it would cost more. At no point were we told about additional charges, yet now Europcar refuses to refund us. Their customer service has been useless, outright refusing to help resolve the issue.

To make matters worse, the server had the audacity to lie and say he informed us, even though both of us can confirm he did not. This is nothing short of a scam, and the dishonesty displayed has completely ruined our experience. Do not trust this company—they clearly thrive on deceiving their customers. Avoid Europcar at all costs if you value honesty, transparency, or decent service!</div>

                <div class='text'>TERRIBLE!
My booking was made via a broker, but that shouldn't matter.
I opted to rent a small car to travel from Scotland to Wales over the Xmas period.
On arrival at the europcar office, St. James centre Edinburgh I was politely greeted followed by "would you like to upgrade?". I had no desire to upgrade as it was already expensive and I didn't need a bigger vehicle. This was before I even knew exactly what make and model of car I was about to receive.
When I did finally get the keys to my rental car, having had a £700 pound deposit taken from me, I discovered I had unintentionally rented an MG3. My heart sank. The deposit, whilst huge in my opinion wouldn't have bothered me so much, however it had to be taken from my debit card as that was the card I had used to make the booking. I asked to use my credit card for this but was told that wasn't allowed. Now I'm £700 short over the Xmas period with a mortgage and bills upcoming!!
I drove the car away, having travelled no more than a mile and already I found the car to be unbearable, the thought of a 5.5hr journey on the M6 when I hadn't even yet reached 30mph was frightening.
The road noise was so intrusive I could barely hear my own thoughts, my skeleton was starting to feel the effects of the terrible chassis and suspension.
I can only describe this car as a very basic vehicle barely meeting the definition of a car, nevermind a modern car. The engine was so gutless, it was like it was powered by a sewing machine but with the noise of a tractor. The suspension felt like it was made of wood and bricks rather than springs and dampers. The headlights when it became dark were she equivalent of 2 candles and the whole time I'm starting to develop a head ache and ringing ears. I hated this car, really hated it. A quick search on auto trader revealed from 41small cars the MG3 to be the worst at #41.
My experience got worse when I returned it.
I returned the vehicle early as I was keen to get my deposit back, so wanted to be present when it was inspected on its return. However, I was told that that vehicle wouldn't be inspected until the following day, where it would sit in a public multi-storie car park overnight. The car could be in a very different condition over that time to when it was returned.
With regards to the car when I complained, the agent's response was "it's because it's a cheap car". Wow!
Now, the car has been returned, but not inspected at that point. I phoned the branch the next at 14:00, but the office is closed, so I phoned customer services. They couldn't even confirm the car had been returned and didn't even know where it was. What??
Following day, I phoned the branch to ask for confirmation that the vehicle had been returned and it's condition so I could be assured I was going to receive my deposit. I was told a manger would email me, that didn't happen. A 2nd phone call later in the day and I was told they hadn't emailed me because it was via a broker. They had my email address which had been provided no less than 3 times. I had to push hard for them to agree to send an email confirming the condition of the vehicle and that I was going to get my deposit back. Unbelievable!
Having hired many cars from other vendors I've always had a good experience,where the vehicle has been checked on return and good communication, not with EUROPCAR. I will never use them again. Ever!
By the way not only was the car rated 41/41, it only has a 3* euro cap rating, meaning it's just about safe.</div>

                <div class='text'>Beware of renting with Europcar UK. Hidden in the small print is that the company will pay any parking fines you receive while hiring the car whether the fine is valid or not. Once a fine is paid you cannot appeal it which leaves you in a catch 22 situation. They will then charge you 45 pounds for administration and take the full amount from your credit card even if you are not guilty. Best practice hirersvwill always give the customer chance to appeal a fine before paying it.</div>

                <div class='text'>I can't believe all the negative experiences people have had with this company. I thought my situation was a one-off. When I arrived at the branch to collect the car, I was told the type of vehicle I selected was not available, the only one available was a fiat 500. I am quite tall person 5'8 so this car was really uncomfortable, nevertheless I accepted as it was only for 2 days, and my next rental was with enterprise (who are so much better, it's like night and day). I can only thank God that I actually took photos of the entire vehicle, before taking it out, honestly, never forget to inspect the vehicle before driving off with it. There was one of their employees staring me down while I was doing this (he looked so annoyed) so I called him over and asked why the tyres had no dust caps, plus I mentioned the same scratches and scruffs the woman who gave me the keys had mentioned. He literally said "don't worry we don't consider those." Upon returning the vehicle, I handed over the keys and they did not inspect the car while I was there, I was told my deposit would be in my account after the woman inspects the vehicle (the same guy I saw when I was taking the pictures and the same woman who gave me the keys we're chatting really in deep conversations) so she was saying I can leave. So I left, the money was returned into my debit card, as I didn't use a credit card, I received a statement of return few days later, and the said I tore/ ripped the two front tyres, funny that because I had the exact same pictures of these "tears/ ripped" tyres from that moment I took the pictures before leaving with the vehicle. A few days later I received another email on Christmas Eve of damage notification of the exact same tyres I photographed. This is by far the least worst experience I've actually read on here. I don't understand why they would release my deposit if they believed I damaged the tyres. There is no way they can charge my bank and just in case they do I've already reported the account I used as stolen/ blocked.</div>

                <div class='text'>What an embarrassment of a company. Paid more than I could with another company thinking if I had any issues it would be easier to deal with one of the "main" rental companies. Man was I wrong. Received our car without the staff doing any precheck and straight away noticed there was a low tire pressure dash light on. When going back to the counter they closed and locked up in the 5 min it took us to walk to the car. Was 10pm at night so nothing to do but take the rental or be stranded two hours from our hotel. Ended up with the car breaking down and then being charged "damage" fee and nearly missed our flight. Disputed and dealt with the absolute worst customer service. Could not recommend strongly enough to never book Europcar UK. What an absolutely joke.</div>

I have made contact with an overseas call centre about 4 or 5 times to try and organise the return of my vehicle, I have stayed in twice for someone not to show up.

                <div class='text'>Do not use! Unless you want your money withheld from you! We paid £250 deposit for the Van plus £70 for the van on the day we got the van. We returned the van the same day and was told the deposit would take 3-5 days to come back to the account. Then it was not put back into our account so we contacted them so we called again and they said it’s actually 6-10 days for the return of the deposit. We then called them again after it was still not returned and they are not returning the deposit with no reason! And now they are not answering the phone when called!</div>

                <div class='text'>*UPDATE* they have now of course tried to charge me for damage not made by me, as well as trying to charge me for two extra days even though I dropped it off early. I’ve also had no reply from customer service*

I am genuinely shocked and appalled at the dreadful service, or lack of, that this company provides. It is terrifying and anxiety inducing.

I booked a rental car to be dropped off at Newcastle Rail Station on a Saturday. Upon returning the vehicle, the shutter was down and there was nobody there to take the keys/refund me my £250 deposit. Note - the sign on the door says Saturday open 9am to 1pm and on my rental agreement it says it is open on a Saturday and to drop it off at 10.30am.

Anyway, I called customer service and spoke to the most disgusting, rude and unhelpful man called Younes (refused to give me his full name of course).

He told me I was being over dramatic and I should just take the car to a different branch. I book the rail station branch as I needed to get a train home (I am disabled and cannot walk far). Plus dropping to another branch would mean having to pay for a taxi back to the station, as well as missing an appointment.

Younes laughed at me when I said I'd miss an appointment and said I was a liar. He said I shouldn't be so dramatic and never once said sorry for this inconvenience.

I then take it to the next nearest branch who told me they cannot accept the car and that Younes had given me incorrect information. They then told me to take it back to the Newcastle branch and post the key through the door. I said I was worried about them trying to charge me for any damage that may occur between Saturday and Monday but they assured me it'll be fine.

I have emailed a complaint however had not heard back and I'm filled with anxiety that they are going to try and charge me more.

Please save your sanity and do not book with this company.</div>

                <div class='text'>Closes on Saturday at 1pm. Not open Sunday. Train arrived late. We called their after hours number on Saturday afternoon and Sunday - no useful help or advice provided. So we could not access the car we had hired and had to wait two days. Called Monday morning - no useful help or advice provided. Went there on Monday during opening hours and they had given the car that we paid for in advance away. Only solution offered was to pay even more money to get a different car. No thanks. Refund refused. Try another company if you are a tourist arriving on a weekend. Do NOT pay in advance.</div>

                <div class='text'>The practices of the London Gatwick office are completely and utterly fraudulent. I write this review so others can be armed with information and well prepared not be defrauded by this specific Europcar office of London Gatwick airport.

I rented a car on the 30th August with no additional insurance protection to cover the excess because it was already covered on my credit card insurance. I communicated this to the representative who then included medium protection on the package and completely disregarded my verbal request. He asked me to sign the back of the page which I did as it was left completely blank without any additions.

After the rental had ended I recognised I had been charged extra on my credit card although there was no follow up email from Europcar to inform of any of the charges (although my email was clearly included on the agreement). I called the office and to my shock they forwarded through the back page agreement which now had handwritten additions of the medium protection package.

Europcar, let’s be clear, this is complete and blatant fraud to change a document after it has been signed! Not only this, but I was also charged for 7 days of insurance even though the rental lasted for only 5 days! See photos on Google Review of Europcar London Gatwick for confirmation of this. This rental finally cost me almost triple the price that what was originally agreed in the initial reservation.

Therefore, I advise anyone attending the Europcar Gatwick office to follow these recommendations:
1. Record your conversation on your phone with any attendant at this office. If the attendant complains or refuses then point them to this review and ask to speak with their manager.
2. Ensure that the attendant countersigns any documents in front of you before leaving the counter. If the signature looks similar to the one I have posted on the Google review then I advise requesting a manager or another attendant to complete the rental agreement.
3. Cross out any inclusions that are not agreed to and take a photo of the main rental agreement and the back page that list additions so it can’t be changed afterwards.
4. Finally, please post your review of this office so that others can be informed of this fraudulent behaviour, and the individual perpetrators are held accountable.

Europcar: If this review means that customer check-in at the Gatwick office takes far longer than any other office then you only have yourselves to blame. I have called customer service on multiple occasions with no action being taken. I have also sent multiple emails that all have been ignored now for over 3 months, which is well over the cited 7-10 days reply time that is promised. You will find the ignored case number as #21259873. I request that a refund be issued for these unauthorised charges and that this fraudulent behaviour of Europcar staff is prevented from occurring any further, especially by the individual that signed this document. If you want to show any endeavour to remain a reputable company then I expect a prompt reply to this review via my email which you have on file. My previous experiences with Europcar have all been positive but this is appalling. It is also worth checking that in all my other rentals I have never requested insurance and I never will. Please check your records to confirm this.</div>

                <div class='text'>Actually I didn't hire a car from them, because Europcar are just another part-time UK car hire firm. I called just before noon on a Saturday, wanting a car for two days and they close at 1pm, so can't deliver one to my address and it's impossible for me to pick one up from the 'local' branch.
Oh well, so sad you lot don't want to make money off me. Enjoy your little part-time jobs. Hey, why not ask for all of Saturday off, seeing as you don't offer a proper service on Saturdays?</div>

                <div class='text'>I Booked a car using booking.com for 9 Days while in the UK. It was with Europcar and managed to get the car for a reasonable price. I was happy as I have not had issues with Europcar before.
Travelling with my 5yo Daughter I decided that I would just pick up a car seat at the airport THIS WAS MY FIRST MISTAKE. To hire a child seat for the day is a ridiculous price the guy at the counter told me something like 16 pounds per day almost the same price as the car. Hiring for over a week this was a huge extra cost (cheaper to buy one). However I was told that for an extra £30 per day I could get an upgraded car and forget about cost of car seat. Reluctantly I agreed, and with a quick swoshing of paperwork I signed the paperwork. As I booked the car in one currency and the documents are in a different currency I did not do the maths I just kept in mind the 30£ extra per day. When I got the bill there was an extra charge of 100 from the 30£ per day quoted. Having spoken to 2 different people at europcar one said it was Vat one said it was a location charge. In either case it does not seem clear to Europcar what the charge is for.

I have tried clarifying this with Europcar on two occasions and have just been fobbed off. The last person I spoke to said they would raise a case.

Recommendation to anyone using Europcar. Be careful of the extortionate cost of hiring car seats, Read the paperwork you sign very carefully, I actually feel they purposely deceive weary travellers into signing things and paying uneccesary upgrades. Also don't expect customer service to help afterwards.

If you book through an alternative supplier probably best not to upgrade at all as you just get tied up in paperwork.</div>

                <div class='text'>claiming of a missing charge cable.

Glasgow Airports branch claimed that I had lost a charging cable from the vehicle I had rented from them, Their proof? Rather blurry pictures of the boot...

What they failed to disclose to me at the start was that the vehicle was a plug in hybrid and the cable would would be in X location within the vehicle.

Come to returning the vehicle at the end of the agreement and carrying out a final check to make sure no belongings are missing I find the charge cable under the boot floor.

now 2 months later they want to charge me £400 for a missing cable because their team there cannot be bothered to fully check over a vehicle. A complaint has already been raised so who knows...</div>

                <div class='text'>Doesn’t even deserve even 1 star I rented a car and the car charging port wasn’t working, they made us take it to the Aldi garage spent my whole day waitin for somone to tell me what was going on, I was on holiday for 3 days 1 days wasted already then gave us a car with much less value, still didn’t sort the difference for that then said they was nothing wrong with the car and told us they wouldn’t charge for the fuel as ther is a deal but still charged us 100£ for fuel on a 1 litre seat Leon, fyi you can’t even put 100£ fuel worth in the car. They also tried to say it was the charging station but the 4 hours trying to sort it out 2 other vehicles charged a left the station. Honestly the worst company, they respectfully decline a refund.

                <div class='text'>Imagine they double charged me whilst booking a car on their website, now cut the long story short they gave me a £30 voucher to use the next time I was going to book a car. Now I’m trying to book a car and they tell me the vouchers THEY GAVE ME are invalid 😂 Honestly you can’t write this stuff !
That’s not even the worst bit, I’ve contacted Europcar by email and told them about this issue, after going back and forth and sending me a member called ‘Rosa’ she advised that I should contact the office that gave me the vouchers but I had already told her the office closed down as they moved location ! Honestly bad customer service and believe me that’s the last of my money ever going on a Europcar rental.</div>

                <div class='text'>I rented a car through Europcar on Goldcar, and the voucher I received described conditions that were completely false. It stated that I could leave a deposit instead of using a credit card. However, upon arrival at Goldcar Portugal, I was informed that they do not accept deposits under any circumstances. This was the first misleading claim.
Additionally, the voucher indicated that renting a device for automatic payment on highway tolls was optional. Again, this was false. According to the staff at the Goldcar counter, the toll payment device is mandatory, not optional as stated in the voucher.
Due to these inaccuracies and misleading representations on Europcar’s voucher, I was unable to use the service as it would have incurred significantly higher costs than initially quoted.
I wrote an email complaint to Europcar, clearly outlining how the service they sold me was misrepresented and requesting a refund. After an unacceptable delay of eight weeks, I received a dismissive, generic response that completely ignored the reason of my complaint, simply stating that no refund would be issued because the voucher was not used. This completely missed the issue: I did not use the voucher because of the false terms Europcar provided.
I responded to this inadequate reply, requesting a proper analysis of my complaint. Four months have now passed, and I have yet to receive any follow-up or resolution.
Ironically, when I submitted a negative review on Europcar’s customer satisfaction survey, I was contacted multiple times the same afternoon. Unfortunately, this was futile as the representatives could not address my complaint, citing it as a matter for a different department.</div>

                <div class='text'>I hired cars for in total about 3months. When I extended rentals, they charged me more then I would have paid by changing cars (due to distance and time has to accept it), but the most disgusting behaviour, they tried several times to take unexplained amounts of money from my account (thankfully never had enough in account). Which serious company does that? Enough that you suffer as repeating customer but this is just to much to accept!</div>

                <div class='text'>I recently made a booking using Europcar and would implore that they are avoided.

I reserved a vehicle on 25th November for collection from the Inverness branch on 16th December. Payment was taken in advance upon reservation. Upon arriving at the airport at 9pm on 16th December, the keys were not released to me. No reason was provided. I was handed a piece of paper with an email address to find out further information. I was then stranded at the airport with no way to reach my destination. The airport eventually closed and I had to wait outside for a ride to my destination as my presence in the airport was not allowing the airport staff to leave and I did not wish to delay their arriving home safe. Europcar didn’t have a similar concern as I was left outside in the rain, in the Scottish Highlands, at 10pm. Surely 22 days is ample time between the reservation being made and my collecting the car to prevent this from happening?

The following day I sent an email to the email address I was provided to inquire further. The email was re-directed to the branch. I found this odd, as why would the branch instruct me to email the address provided if that email address was going to re-direct me back to the branch? Regardless, I waited a further day for contact. No contact was received. I then began to get concerned as they had already taken payment and my booking was live on the app and I had not received a refund. I proceeded to call Europcar on three occasions. On each occasion the advisor tried their best, but due to company policy being flawed, they were unable to advise me regarding my refund or the booking. Each advisor referred me back to the branch. I would recommend they listen back to the call logs in this instance as all three advisors agreed that the situation was a mess.

The branch did not contact me as promised, so I returned to the branch. No further information was provided and I was once again referred back to head office.

This has been a horrendous ordeal. Europcar need to consider the appalling customer experience that is delivered. Note I am a repeat customer, having rented cars on three occasions using Europcar, and was still treated terribly.

Do not use. There are other rental companies that will take your custom and deliver what is promised.

EDIT: in response to the canned response left by Europcar, I contacted using the link provided and have not received any response. An urgent issue treated without consideration on their end…</div>

                <div class='text'>Europcar UK is a fraud. They charge for the same scratch multiple times, there is no evidence at the paperwork, if you ask them, they would come with an internal ruler showing what size of scratch or dent is allowed and where but if you go to the terms and conditions, there is no such a thing like 'a damage size allowance' on regular cars. Scratch on the wheels were on the photos before and after, they sent me bill 521 gbp for scratch on 2 wheels. Car returned in August 2024, invoice came in Oct/Nov 2024, I have dispute, as on 18/Dec still not resolved.
Also, I have another contract with them, where a car had a sticker it has been cleaned but in fact there were spiders nets on multiple areas, not cleaned at all, screenwash was completelly dry, with multiple scratches all over and without any evidence in paperwork. The car was in unsafe condition. We phoned multiple times, sent emails, with official letter and photos attached, without any answer or solution. It has been since August 2024, till Dec 2024 still open case, no answer.
On the other hand they want to send my 'unpaid invoice 521 for their damages' to solicitors.
When I sent an email with photos, they replied I have not sent the correct photos, etc.
I am preparing official complain to inform car rental regulators.

I have rented cars with turo, I have 5* reviews, also with alamo and others. From what I tried, just europcar is a massive scam.</div>

                <div class='text'>Complete scammers and illegal activity. I rented a car 2 months ago, they queried marks on the rim of the wheel, which I advised were already there and shared photos and videos of them. They agreed and returned my full deposit. Now 2 months later they have charged my credit card £93 for ‘damage’. I don’t even think that’s legal and raised a dispute with my credit card to return the money. Avoid these scammers at all costs</div>

                <div class='text'>Despite renting a fully insured car from Europcar switzerland , agreement number 50873110 with the highest insurance coverage, I faced a serious safety issue due to a faulty satnav that led me over a dangerous mountain route. When I called Europcar Assistance, they failed to respond. I had to involve the police, who sent emergency services to tow the car to safety, costing me 200 CHF. To my shock, Europcar refused to cover the towing charges and provided zero support throughout the ordeal. Extremely disappointing experience with no accountability or customer support</div>

                <div class='text'>*** Edit - I escalated this complaint through some of my own channels and eventually europcar agreed to refund me on a mutual basis. So I am glad it’s fixed now, just caused a lot of stress on the way. - ***

I had a Europcar rental for three months while my Mercedes was being repaired, and the experience was abysmal from start to finish. The car was delivered with only 3/4 of a tank of fuel, despite their policy stating it should arrive with a full tank, yet I was still charged for fuel I didn’t use. When it came to collection, they left the car in my driveway for over a week and then gave me just two hours’ notice while I was 800 miles away on business. I had to scramble to get my brother to drive 60 miles round trip to hand over the keys.

Despite these massive inconveniences and their lack of professionalism, Europcar has shown no interest in addressing my concerns or resolving these unfair charges. They expect customers to bend over backward for their mistakes while offering no accountability or goodwill in return. I’ll never use Europcar again and would strongly advise others to avoid them.</div>

                <div class='text'>Further to my other review I now have their collections team demanding £54.80, from an invoice that is basically borderline fraudulent!
I cannot speak to the branch in Swindon as they do not answer their phone line. I state DO NOT USE this company under any circumstances they either do not know what they are doing or are just untrustworthy full stop.
5 days for branch to investigate customer services give them is up and now £250 down - will seek legal action if necessary.
Update you have finally responded and offered me £225.04 back you still owe me the remaining amount as the van was not returned late either!!
I’ve given up talking to Samuel in customer services as he is not responding to the emails.
Still waiting for my money which you hang on to for up to 10 days. Finally had the word sorry used in one email about time! Also writing off £54.80 I never owed you in the 1st place is a poor choice of words. I still want my £24.96 back as that is a late vehicle charge that doesn’t exist as the vehicle was returned on time after 3 days not 8 days as you have already established due to lack of documentation as you put it !</div>

                <div class='text'>I was involved in car accident in May I reported the incident to my insurance company at the time as well has the pain and suffering I received they then put me in contact with Europcar Group uk ltd for replacement vehicle while my car was being repaired

They was supposed to give a like for like car that was sent in a email from them, will were do I start.... I arrange for the delivery of the car at time I would be home in afternoon the car turned up in the morning good thing my child was home they left car with my child and it was NOT the same car as they described in their email what I received it was so large like a tank and dirty discussing service with no explanation or nothing they collected the car few days later when they were available didn't wait for me to return home the same treatment I received from the start from them terrible service I telephone them to make arrangements to pay the petrol I used due to financial hardship
I pay their money plus the interest they put on top over 3 instalments that was owed and now 5 months later Im still receiving debt collectors letters and emails demanding payment to no avail I have tried to get in contact with Europcar Group uk ltd collections department and their debt collector company by the name of Shakepspeare Martineau no one has responded to my emails or telephone calls which is causing me considerable distess.

This company and the bad service I've received and the emails and letters the harassment from them I would never recommend this company stay clear of Europcar Group uk ltd they are unprofessional they don't care about their customers.</div>

                <div class='text'>OK so imagine how I felt when I went to the Penzance office hoping to pick up my car, only to find a note in the window saying that the office had been closed a week before and I had not been informed. We had to get a train and a taxi to their Truro office, where no one apologized and they had no record on their system of my reservation, despite me having at least 3 profiles on there from previous hiring. So in the end they refunded me the just over 17 quid for the train and taxi and refused to give us anything for the anxiety and stress. In addition I now know that the Penzance office staff have been laid off, just before christmas, how horrible, I will never use them again on principle.</div>

                <div class='text'>I am very disappointed with Europcar and as being a regular customer. I booked a Mercedes A class Automatic for 3 weeks and was given an Audi Q5 what i thought was amazing and at no time was i told i would have to pay double for this. I signed the document thinking this was my original rental cost for the A class. Unfortunately i had to return the Q5 as had a slow puncture from the start and was given an Audi Q2 what was tiny but all they had. I returned this car after the rental and got another bill taken out from my account what doubled my cost. I questioned this to be told i had been given an upgrade and this was the cost !!! I never got offered this and would never have approved, I was simply told the Q5 was your car. i never approved this ? I told their Customer Service i had been given a Audi Q2, they told me this was an upgrade from a Mercedes A Class !! are you kidding me !! on your website an Audi A3 is cheaper than an A Class Mercedes, i felt their customer services just brushed me off !!</div>

                <div class='text'>this global company hide behind small print as a way to rip off customers all the time.
Picking up cars at night in poorly lit garages, making it impossible to see any damages - then to be charged for damage.
Charged for travelling out of the country, when i didn't, and they failed to mention there was a charge.
con-artists. complained all the way to CEO etc alain.favey, michel.kisfaludi AT EUROPCAR.COM - no one cares. just hide behind small print.

                <div class='text'>Beware - Underhand Upgrade Sales and Vehicle Damage Claims! Hired vehicle for a week from Gatwick Airport, desk agent offered a car upgrade stating £40 only, he listened to our family discussion that it was only £40 more and we agreed. In fact this was a daily cost, the agent made no attempt to correct our mistake and we didn’t fully check the upgrade agreement to spot his underhand technique. Following the hire we were also invoiced for new damage to the car, luckily we had photographic evidence that proved the damage was existing damage and the invoice was cancelled. An extremely disappointing and stressful service in which we felt Europcar were only interested in getting as much money out of us as possible. Never again! We complained to Europcar and their answer was the agents word against ours, whatever happened to the customer is always right.</div>

                <div class='text'>Used them 3 times there will never be a 4th time. Got stung for £45 at Southampton branch due to insurance waiver that I had already paid within the online booking fees. However the Swindon branch has topped this by generating an invoice in Dec for me hiring a van for 8 days excess mileage and a late return billing me over £500. This relates to a 3 day hire in October that was all settled and van returned on time and less excess mileage paid. After receiving emailed invoice I have contacted customer services whilst they ask branch to investigate. In the meantime the branch has taken £250 out of my bank account using my debit card that was used for the £250 security deposit in October. I managed to stop them taking another £54 from my credit card. I am beyond impressed with them. A hire before this one took 4 months and 4 phone calls and visits to sort out incorrectly billed excess mileage- make sure you take pics on collection and drop of if you really want to risk using this cowboy company!! Thanks for your pointless response below - I’d already spoken to your customer services who raised a dispute with the branch who then stole £250 from my account</div>

                <div class='text'>Turned up at the Oxford branch the evening before a planned international trip to pick up furniture from my parent's place in France, only to be told that the booked van had been cancelled as they didn't have any available. This is after spending £300 plus on hotels and the channel crossing.
Their support team are still insisting they sent an email 3 days before the booking, but this simply isn't true - it certainly never reached my inbox, and I don't delete emails, so it would still be there if they had sent it. In fact Europcar sent me three emails during the booking process (so the email address they have for me is clearly correct and not going to the junk folder) one to confirm the booking, one 3 days before reminding me to bring my driving license, and one literally 1 hour before the booking saying "You're going to get the keys at Oxford and you're ready to hit the road"!!
If you need a van ad-hoc and are willing to try again another weekend, then go for it, but if you need it as part of a bigger plan, maybe find somewhere a bit more reliable.</div>

                <div class='text'>What a rude and obnoxious telesales person. I wanted to extend my rental and when I questioned why it had gone up £20 in a week, he said that was the price that had come up on his screen, that's fine but his manner was quite rude and it just went downhill from there when my card was declined,I asked to be transferred to Prestwick, but was told that's not going to do you any good as they have the same equipment as themselves. I had to shout over him are you listening to me. Crazy... couldn't be more different to the Prestwick team. Very polite and helpful.</div>

                <div class='text'>Please people be careful with this company (I used the Wolverhampton branch). I hired a car on Friday 15th November till the Monday 18th of November for a holiday I was going on. The guy at the counter (Chris) did the paperwork and told me not to worry if I couldn't get back early Monday as they knew I had a 3-4 hr d I've back. On the Monday I got back to the branch around 2:30pm the same guy was there again on the computer he took the keys and said don't worry I'll check it back in for you. This all seemed fine until I was expecting my deposit back. I had the full amount to hire the car pending in my bank (hire & deposit) when all of a sudden it came out of pending and all I got back for my deposit was just over £20. I knew this was wrong as I filled the tank back up before dropping her car off. I knew I was owed around £250. When It didn't go in when I thought it would, I got in touch with them about it (which is also a near impossible task as they never seem to answer their phones it took ages). I was told then that because the car was late back they had taken an extra day off us. We told them the car was returned in plenty of time and what we were told at the desk. After some back and forth calls this Chris admitted he booked it in late and he had to fill in a form to get the money back and it would be sorted as it was his mistake. Ok I thought it's been sorted so waited again. It got to the 28th of November still no money back again I contacted them and was told the form was sent off now it's down to head office to approve it. I then took it upon myself to ring head office the person was rude and said that what I'd had back (£20 previously) was all I was getting and that's it. Now I'm mad 😡 I tried the branch again and after a lot of back and forth again was told now the office definitely have the paperwork and it just needs to clear and go into my bank. It is now the 9th December they have had my money for nearly a month, they are gaining interest on it and I'm out of pocket. I need the money back as it's Christmas and it will help. I really feel like they are taking me for a fool and they have really taken the P*** . Again trying to get in touch with them to no avail no one answering my calls please people if u can use another company or make sure when you take the car back that it's checked straight back in or you will have the same problem as me 😡😡😡</div>

                <div class='text'>Absolutely useless. The car hire process was OK, the car was fine, but we had to return a day early and to the same depot, not a different one as originally planned. They issued a receipt showing me paying only the services I'd used, but only issued a partial refund for the rest from my prepayment. I understood the reaon for the partial refund, but after days of emails to customer services and calls to their centre in Morocco, they still refuse to give me a receipt for what I've actually paid so that I can claim it back from my employers. I'm fobbed off every time. Absolutely disastrous customer services. Don't touch with a bargepole.</div>

                <div class='text'>I'm a very regular customer. Just rented a 2024 van for 3 days. No one explained any of the safety features.
Steering started to pull and I had no idea why. I was on the M3. I pulled on to the hard shoulder. After 4pm getting dark. I tried repeatedly to get someone at Europcar (as seen in my phone log) but one number only changes tires. The other number put me in a queue. Gary Smith, the CEO did not seem to realise that HIS COMPANY FAILED TO ASSIST ME, A FEMALE NOW STUCK IN A VERY DANGEROUS POSITION. Had someone from Europcar answered my calls and told me about steering assist, I would not have panicked. I finally got to my destination at 9 pm.

The location offered me 3 days use. Someone named Irene who investigated and decided not to show any goodwill to a regular customer who is also a Privilege club member decided to renege on this offer.

I'm going to complain to the Ombudsman. This Irene has no idea how her denial and refusal will impact business.

EUROPCAR FAILED IN ITS DUTY OF CARE BY LEAVING A 63 YEAR OLD FEMALE STUCK ON THE M3 HARD SHOULDER IN THE DARK BECAUSE I DIDN'T RECOGNISE THE STEERING ASSIST ICON, NO HAND BOOK AND COULD NOT GET HELP FROM EUROPCAR.

I'm now going to cancel my reservation from Dec 19 to Dec 22 and go to Enterprise.

I called 999. They told me to call AA.

In response to the reply from Europcar.
I sent all info to the CEO office. Someone named Irene replied. She made excuses. She missed the point that there was no one from Europcar answering my calls, despite my calling the 800 helpline.

I'm filing a complaint with Financial Ombudsman and another agency

Charged me an extra day because they dropped the car off early and picked it up on time. I had no control over the drop up or pick up time. So they scammed me out of an extra days rent.
I tried to complain several time but they either didn’t reply or twisted my complaint to put me in the wrong. I will never use them again and I suggest you don’t</div>

                <div class='text'>I had a very frustrating experience with Europcar car rental company in Salzberg airport and poor support service from UK team too. When I returned the car at their centre in Salzburg airport, I was explicitly told that there were no additional payments to be made. However, I was shocked to later see that I was charged nearly €200 for cleaning, despite the fact that I had thoroughly cleaned the car before returning it and there was no mention or in the contract about any cleaning charges.

What made the situation even worse was that they didn't inspect the car in my presence, even though I specifically requested it. It felt like they took advantage of the situation and slapped on an unfair charge without any justification.

It’s incredibly frustrating when a company gives you false assurances and then tries to impose arbitrary fees without transparency or accountability.
I won’t be using this rental service again and would advise others to be very cautious before renting from Europcar & contact your credit card company after the rental return to put a block on Europcar before they steal your money.</div>

I am not buying the car just hiring it. Why they need a credit check is beyond me i had the money in the bank and on credit card but they refused said to email them and dispute it.

                <div class='text'>Just hired a van for 24hrs from the Southampton branch. On collecting the vehicle it was filthy dirty inside and out for which the staff member apologised,, explaining they were short staffed.

Just received my final invoice to see I have been charged an additional £114 on top of the original £66 hire, for apparently an additional 559 miles above the 250 allowance.

I covered a total of 108 miles in the 24hr hire, so not sure where they have recorded 809 miles from ?

Just spoken to their customer service advisor and they will investigate this over the next 3-5 working days, including vehicle tracking information which will clearly show their mistake.

In the meantime they get to hold onto my money !!

CHECK YOUR VEHICLE CAREFULLY BEFORE YOUR HIRE AND BACK IN AGAIN.</div>

                <div class='text'>The staff behind the counter managed to convince me that the insurance I had pre-purchased was not adequate and that for an additional £21 I would be sufficiently covered. needless to say that he neglected to inform me that the £21 did not include tax, and was a daily rate. I realized this once the purchase had already gone through, I tried to cancel it but they weren't interested in helping me after I had handed over my money.

My complaint was ignored for two weeks before they sent me a canned response that the signature on the document was binding and this eliminated the possibility of a refund. I am now in the process of filing a complaint with an external regulatory body over their dishonest sales techniques.

I ended up paying for unnecessary insurance that cost more than 150% of the car rental itself. No one would agree to this. Please be careful of this company's deceptive sales techniques, don't let them convince you that you need to give them more than you already have. Don't sign anything unless you're certain you understand what they are telling you. And be aware that you will likely not receive help from this company once they have received your money.

UPDATE following the below response - Europcar has flatly denied my request for an investigation or a refund, requiring me to escalate the issue to a third party.

I will never use this company again.</div>

                <div class='text'>I have booked a car, Reservation number: 1182274307 from 15 to 22 November 2024 through the website.
On my arrival at Stansted, at the Europcar counter, the clerk, John, deceived me when he proposed an UPGRADE because the car as ordered was not available and suggested an upgrade to a Mercedes which I firmly refused then he strongly recommended to take a Toyota Hybrid with only a small contribution of only £30 in addition to my payment that I already made.
Having no other choice, I accepted an extra total charge of £30. He rushed me to sign the so called standard form and directed me to take the car as there was another client behind me.
A few day later I received the mail with a very unfortunate surprise, I was charged £30 + Vat for an extra total of £299,88. That added to my paid booking for a Citroen C3 Aircross makes a total of 463,49 (this makes the daily rate £66,21)!!
This is a scam. Please note that a Mercedes from Europcar starts around 34/35£ a day. I wonder what car costs around £66 /day!!! This is scam and the company refused to review the complaint.
I strongly suggest to avoid accepting any upgrade from this company as they will in some way they will trick or deceive you.
Never again Europcar.
And it is pointless to contact your customer service, as I did immediately after two days of rent and again twice after I returned the vehicle. Always the same reply which obviously invites me to contact and recontact the “useless” customer service.</div>

                <div class='text'>#1 in misleading customers, upgraded specifically to an engine driven hybrid, was given a plug-in with ZERO Charge !! Was worse than a regular petrol car. It had continuous faults, system errors, upon return the tech said, they all do it, it’s a badly designed car (MG). Opted for fuel option, i was told i would get a refund upon return for remaining, apparently this is only for full tank. At the front desk they were rude, I called customer service, after two weeks the declined to refund any nominal amount. So i will never, ever rent again from EuropCar, wish I had checked TrustPilot 1st before renting i can see why 47% give a 1 star rating. Be aware.

Europcar reach out, but all their link does is make me start over the whole process - if you are Interested Europcar check the CS 21717807</div>

                <div class='text'>When picking up my rental car, I was repeatedly pressured to accept additional options, even though I was already fully insured through Sunny Cars, their partner company. Despite my clear refusal, I was still charged an additional €437.80 for an unnecessary extra insurance = one extra car.

Customer service (which did respond in a timely manner, so that was great) refuses to take responsibility and shows no sign of improving this process among its staff.

This is outright deception and damages trust in Europcar. Sorry but not recommended!</div>

                <div class='text'>I hired a car from 31/10-04/11/2024. Pick up was smooth but I should have insisted the agent noted the marks & scrapes on the car. There was 3 listed on the form and I was told to check the car before leaving. I did and I advised agent that there were more marks on the car. He told me to email them in, he did not come out and sign them off. I emailed the marks/crapes in together with photos. On my return the agent checked the car and then told me that there was a fresh scrape on the alloy. I had to go down on my hands and knees to see it. I advised him that I did not do this. As the shuttle bus was waiting for me I left immediately, Within an hour 189.99€ + 18.88€ was charged to my card. I asked for the science behind the comment 'it looks fresh". I can only describe it as an appalling customer service. I felt I was scammed/ set up by Europcar.</div>

                <div class='text'>I had an incident during my rental and reported the incident straight away. On returning the vehicle they said they would send me an invoice for the damage/excess. I had 3rd party insurance so just have the standard excess of 1600GBP with Europcar.
I have been waiting over 2 months for the invoice and have emailed and called many times and been told that they are still investigating the incident and that they will let us know.
With a deadline for claiming with the 3rd party insurance, they are causing unnecessary stress and complication for a straightforward incident.</div>

                <div class='text'>Unbelievably poor service from Europcar.
I hired a car from monday 25th November until 1pm on 30th November.
The Warrington branch I had used previously on visiting the uk was always very good.
However, on Saturday I returned the car an hour earlier than booked. Nobody was present to receive the car. The drop off box was sealed.
After contacting europcar more than 8 times, I was literally pushed from pillar to post. I was told to leave the keys inan unlocked car, but told I'd be liable for any theft or damage.
One operator even had me connected to an employee who left four years ago.
Atrocious service from the company.
To add insult further, I was also told to take the car to a liverpool depot more than 15 miles away.
As a visitor to the UK for a brief visit, I can only describe my experience on Saturday as unprofessional, shoddy and less than second rate.
I have asked for the transcripts of my calls which I'm sure won't materialise.
I eventually had to leave the vehicle unlocked with the keys inside the glovebox as I had already missed one train but couldn't miss another. My leaving the vehicle at 13.20 being massively inconvenient for me causing disruption to the rest of my already tight schedule.</div>

which I wish they did not,I fill car up on return to dealers, where no check car in. Luckily I took photo of full tank when I dropped off car, 2 weeks later I received email invoice for £21.00 for patrol. This is a rip off.

UPDATE
THEY REPLY THAT YOU SHOULD EMAIL THEM TO SOLVE THE ISSUE, BUT THEY ACTUALLY WILL ONLY REPEAT THEIR PREVIOUS BROKEN STAEMENTS.(i wonder if they will reply the same misleading reply to this update)

                <div class='text'>I booked and paid, in full, for a small rental car through easyJet, including insurance. It came to £138
When I got Birmingham to collect it, I was asked if I wanted to upgrade to a bigger vehicle. Initially I said no, I don't want to spend anymore more money. She then cheerfully replied "oh don't worry, the upgrade is free". I just needed to pay a refundable £295 insurance deposit which would be returned when I bought the car back.
When I got to my destination I realised what I had signed was a entirely separate rental agreement and would not be getting any of my money back. I phoned customer services straight away but they just seemed irritated by me and got nowhere. Sent numerous emails to be told I should have checked what I was signing.
I was exhausted with travelling with small children and feel they deliberately deceived and lied to me to double charge me for the rental. Seems like a common tactic that they deploy. All in all cost £433 to hire a mediocre saloon for 3 days.</div>

                <div class='text'>Horrendous experience with renting a car and then the subsequent customer service that I received. Was forced into an upgrade that I didn’t want- they played the language barrier card so paid the €23 extra. We then paid an extortionate amount of money for a car seat that was both unsafe and filthy. Then When contacting customer services with both photographs and proof of both of these problems, they dismissed my concerns. To rub salt in the wounds, the car itself had warning lights on and a safety recall light on too. Again, something that the customer services department ignored in my email. I rented this car for myself, my husband and a baby whilst on holiday. This car and the car seat were potentially unsafe. This resulted in barely using the car when on holiday, therefore not using it to its full potential and wasting money. Customer service completely dismissed both the photos and my concerns.</div>

                <div class='text'>I ordered a van to move house and they assured me on the contact centre they had a van for 8am. Shortly after the local branch called me saying they don't in fact have it but will try and get one at some point. This was the day before my house move. I managed to locate nother van with another company so booked that instead.
Europcar then found a van on the day of the booking in the afternoon, I had to be out of the house by 2pm. I was busy moving so didn't have chance to call them back when they left a voicemail. They have now charged me for the full price of the van with no further contact. Absolutely disgusting practice, awful company.</div>

                <div class='text'>Ongoing from my previous review of this company. I used 1ltr of fuel as I only did 7 miles in the inappropriate car they supplied to me.

Now they have had the cheek to send me a bill for £26.21 for 13ltrs!! DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY.

I left obviously annoyed, what annoyed me more was then being charged £110 no show fee a week later. I’ve tried to speak with their customer service, but no response nor apology nor action. Avoid this terrible company at all costs. When I actually got a van I rented through Enterprise, the experience was completely different, I actually got a van, very friendly staff and the van was in excellent condition.</div>

                <div class='text'>Hired a small, cheap car (eg Fiat 500) via Easyjet from Europcar, Glasgow Airport from 21 to 25 November 2024.
On arrival at Europcar woman in reception who dealt with me stated that the car had been upgraded at no extra cost, implying that upgrade had already been done. She asked me to sign rental forms, I believed what she told me and did not read through all the details as I had been travelling since 02:00 that morning.
I received an invoice on 26 November stating that an extra £142.80 will be taken from my card for the upgrade. I was shocked and disgusted by this, as the employee had stated the upgrade was free and made no mention of extra charges.
The staff dealing with the actual vehicle at collection and return were excellent, but the woman in reception lied to me.
I will never use Europcar again!

Update: 3/12/24. Almost impossible to contact Europcar, had to use email address webmaster at europcar.com after their online contact form failed to work over several days. Customer Services are a joke, after several days received a reply stating: ' I wanted to take a moment to express our heartfelt gratitude for taking the time to share your positive feedback regarding our services. Your satisfaction is incredibly important to us, and we are thrilled to hear that we met your expectations.' WHAT! If my review and information sent to them was positive, what does it take to be negative? They are covering up for an employee who lied to me and not engaging in any way with my complaint. Absolute rubbish, avoid at all costs!!!</div>

                <div class='text'>We rented a car from Europcar at Gatwick Airport during the summer. Unfortunately, the vehicle we had booked and paid for was unavailable, and we were provided with a substitute. This was the first indication that things were not going smoothly.

Despite having paid in advance for insurance, we were informed there was an additional hidden fee for coverage, which was an unexpected and unwelcome cost. We had budgeted for the trip assuming everything was prepaid, so this extra charge forced us to adjust our finances.

While returning the car, an object was thrown from the vehicle in front of us on the motorway, striking the windscreen and causing a chip. At the rental depot, we informed the agent of the incident, providing details of the time and location, and offered to file a police report to address the situation. The agent dismissed our offer, advising that there was no need for a report, as nothing would be done about the chip. Trusting their advice, we proceeded to catch our flight home.

Months later, we were surprised to receive a charge for the windscreen damage, as there was no third party to claim from. Had we followed through with the police report, as we initially offered, this situation might have been avoided.

In summary, we strongly recommend caution when renting from Europcar UK. From hidden fees to aggressive upselling tactics, it seems they are more focused on extracting additional charges after the rental is complete. Our experience left us disappointed and frustrated.</div>

                <div class='text'>The motability car they brought wasn't suitable so tried for 3 days to get through to their Bradford branch but no answer. So decided to go to their branch in Bradford and have never experienced anything like it. We were stood in the rain with my partner who uses a walking stick and were spoke to by a lady through a small window because they don't have a door for you to go through. We were told they were very busy although there was just this one lady not doing very much and that there were no other other vehicles available although there was a yard full of vehicles that resembles a scrapyard. Please please avoid this company and especially the Bradford branch.</div>

                <div class='text'>The office I dealt with was in the north east of England. To begin with I would say the actual office is very difficult to get hold of. The number rings out for 15mins and then ends the call saying the office is busy. Secondly they cancelled a reservation that they shouldn't have done as they claimed I hadn't collected it but I called to say I wanted it delivered. Thirdly after promising a replacement car after the initial car broke down they didn't follow through and left me.without a car.
So to recap non exist communication, not following through on timelines. There are better companies out there and it's a shame they are so bad.</div>

Minutes after making the booking and paying £278 they cancelled the booking. We spoke to Europcar they told us it’s up to 14 days for a refund. They said it wasn’t possible to use the money for a different booking. Now we don’t have the money to book another car</div>

                <div class='text'>AVOID. I’d give them zero stars if I could. Took my money. Cancelled within 40 minutes of collection. Took zero responsibility. Said bookings “aren’t guaranteed”. But take your money, send confirmation and allow early check in. But it’s still not guaranteed? Pretty much tried to say it was my fault. Horrible customer care. It’s been 14 working days and STILL waiting on refund of £120</div>

The car they rented us at Gatwick Airport had dents and scratches on every panel and it took the agent over half an hour just to log them all.
On early return a refund was offered by the agent and was accepted but it then took the threat of legal action and a complaint to the BVRLA Alternative Dispute Service to get them to pay.
It was eight weeks before payment was made.</div>

                <div class='text'>I booked car on Europcar UK website at Slovakia Bratislava.They took €100 from my account without any prior notification, two weeks after I returned the car. When I contacted Europcar Slovakia,they claimed it was penalty and my email wasn’t working. I sent them another email address, but they ignored me again. I filed a complaint with Europcar UK and they did not care!!!
In the end, they sent me a penalty for a completely different car than the one I rented, claiming it that none of my email addresses were functional.I consider their behavior fraudulent and untrustworthy!
I will never rent from Europcar UK!!!I strongly advise everyone to avoid this company. If they get the chance, they will try to scam you and cover it up with lies.They will steal your money!</div>

                <div class='text'>I booked a Citreon Berlingo from Maidstone branch for a 4 day booking, 2 days were needed for a trip to Nottinghamshire to pick up some garden equipment and 2 days to attend a photography course which involved visiting sites in Kent with width and height restrictions on access and parking hence the need for the Berlingo which is about the same height as a car and would be fine with the height restrictions. When I arrived to pick the vehicle up they did not have a Berlingo, only a Renault Traffic which is 2.4m high. Given the time and short notice I needed the van for the Nottinghamshire pick up so had no choice but to accept it, but I was unable to use it for the photography course and ended up borrowing a car for this. The vehicle was more expensive on diesel and more costly for the Dartford Crossing. Having returned the vehicle I complained to Europcar's central tel number only to be told that the Traffic and Berlingo are "similar" and they refused to consider my issue. In fact on Europcar's vehicle specification pages the Traffic is 2ft taller and at least 1ft wider. How can these be considered "similar"? No wonder their trust pilot ratings are so poor.</div>

                <div class='text'>This June I have reported I am in danger and the car I have renting from them is in danger too.Because I was challenging suspicious people, we can call them criminals wearing fully black clothes, shoes and SKI MASKS (end of June in 20 degrees) after midnight on the street in a posh area. (I am not writing every details down for a good reason ) They tried to damage the car that I was driving because I called the police on them and that was definitely an action which prevented one or multiple crimes that night. Later the police arrived and those criminals did hide and they lost they torch during they ran away. Following morning the neighbours told me around 5days earlier late night criminals are broke into someone's garage and many things were stolen and caused insane material damage. Where I found them it was the same location where the crime happened earlier.
I wanted to protect the Europecar's and other citizens belongings from those criminals when I challenged them, but they did not appropriated I called the police and I disturbed their criminal activities that night so they tried to damage the car during I was driving. So after I asked help from Europcar, my prize was: a terminated contract that I did not know until it was discovered later by accidentally.
How's my torture started?
I called the branch I told them what happened and what the police advised... I requested to swap my car regarding these serious facts. I had a call back from a female staff from Bristol Airport Branch a bit later who said I cannot get a different car and denied to give me her manager name that she referred to as a person who made this decision.I raised complaint later on that day via phone and the complaint team found their actions unprofessional.They asked me to send them the police log number that shows this was a real action. So, I have sent them via email and they said they will investigate it.
I was not able to go back to that area with the car I am driving because the police advised me to don't do that, regarding the potential revenge of these criminals. Needless to say how hard was that day and night with these difficulties. Insane pressure on me either physically in danger, the car I have responsibility for also in danger and this was a huge psychological pressure for me... Terrible experience just because my safety and the car was not important for them.
Following day (day after my request was refused by the airport team) I went to a different brunch with a hope they will give me a different car, but there we faced with a shocking fact, they discovered the car I am driving is not even contracted with me, that's meant I must not drive it. He advised me to go back to the Bristol Airport team and asking from them why is this car that I am using is not contracted with me. After my arrival to the Bristol Airport team they also confirmed face to face (not just one, two people) they will not give me a different car just because I AM IN DANGER AND THEIR CAR IS IN DANGER TOO. Yes,not their problem if I will be stubbed or end up in a hospital also if something happens with the car. I will need to pay for that damage anyway so that's not a problem for them.I am just a walking bankomat that's needs to pay and pay....
After they stated this I told them I will be back tomorrow and I will bring the car back because they did this with me and I told them anyway the car is not contracted with me. I started to walk away but one of the member asked the reg.number to check why the other branch member said the car I am driving is not contracted. He found out why is my name not registered with the car. This reason was:
because 28 hours earlier a different staff member (who denied to give me the manger's name and said they will not swap the car) terminated my contract. They also told it cannot be by mistake because this is a process to make it done,not just one red button to push. So, the person who discovered this problem said this is serious and he called a different brunch reached out a member there who can backdating/modify the contract. Yes, there is a man who knows the system very well and they calling him to make things to disappear , 'modify' in the system. So, the 28 hours of gap evaporated from my rental history. How do I know this? Because the Europcar stated multiple times there is no gap in my rental history and that gap is disappeared, I saw this with my eyes. However it was there before I have many different evidence for that. So, because of the terminated contract that he found,I couldn't drive the car that I am arrived with, so I had a different car from that night. And when I told him the stop start system is not working properly he just said "this is MG"
Needless to say, this is going to different social media platforms and I do work on it to publish in different news too plus goes to legal way to get my compensation for this long torture.</div>

We had a conversation at the beginning and they insisted that the deposit was not an approved purchase, even though I sent proof that the purchase was shown as approved on my card. The person who answers the customer service emails does not read what I write and responds with excerpts from the manual, saying that everything is fine, within normal limits. My card statement closed and they charged me about $1,000 for the deposit. I am outraged by such disregard for the customer.</div>

                <div class='text'>I will never ever use Europcar again!! 😡😡😡
I was involved in a serious car accident and unfortunately my car was written off by the person that caused it.
I was forced to have a hire car at my own expense so I could get to work. The hire car I had booked was unavailable on the day of collection at Manchester Airport and I was downgraded to a car I wasn’t comfortable driving after my accident, I wanted a similar car I knew how to drive. After I told the desk my situation I was told I was able to upgrade to a car I knew how to drive. For an extra £10 a day, I agreed and proceeded not knowing that I would have been charged a lot more money for the upgrade I originally booked a £363.58 car for 15 days I was actually charged £900 for 15 days with a £500 deposit that I still haven’t received back.
Not only have I been mis-sold, I am under more financial pressure because I was mis-sold by Europcar.
Customer service is utter rubbish and they are not interested in you. I am self employed and need a car for my job. I worked for 15 days to just pay for a hire car, it would have been cheaper to just be off work.
They do not deserve your business
AVOID!!!!! 😡😡😡
…. I know Europcar will reply back to this comment with some lovely customer service reply or asking us to private message them…. Don’t be fooled everyone they are utter thieves with appalling customer service !!!</div>

                <div class='text'>This company is a scam. I rented an electric car for one day, but on the day of pickup, I was informed that it was unavailable and was given a hybrid car instead. I was assured that the price difference would be refunded. Instead, the company charged me 150% more. This matter will be reported to the bank. I do not recommend this company, avoid at all costs

Edit; contacted the customer service who don’t take any responsibility for the wrong charges and not helpful at all!</div>

                <div class='text'>24, nov update: Followed up and received a canned reply, insisting we have signed the agreement, which is expected.
=====
I recently rented a car from Europcar at Manchester Airport through Trip.com. Upon arrival, I was offered a “free upgrade.” Tired after a 19-hour flight and being unfamiliar with the detailed terms, I trusted the salesperson’s assurances and signed the agreement. To my shock, I later discovered I was charged £847, including fees for services and upgrades I was never informed about.

These charges were not transparently explained during the transaction. While I acknowledge my signature, I believe this was obtained under misleading circumstances. The salesperson’s failure to disclose critical information left me feeling taken advantage of.

I reached out to Trip.com to dispute these charges, but the resolution was unsatisfactory. Despite presenting my case, the charges remain, with no acknowledgment of their lack of transparency.

Unfortunately, I am not alone. After my experience, I found several similar complaints about Europcar’s unclear practices, such as:

TripAdvisor Review of Europcar Heathrow -
1. “Scam Upgrade from Europcar!!”
2. "Scammed for Extras fees"
3. "Reddit Post on Europcar Issues - Europcar Heathrow Rental Scam"

My intent in sharing this review is to warn future customers. If you choose Europcar, I strongly recommend documenting every interaction, asking for detailed explanations of all fees, and carefully reviewing the agreement before signing. Transparency and trust are essential, and unfortunately, my experience with Europcar fell far short of this standard.</div>

                <div class='text'>Dreadful, one star is generous as minus wasn’t an option.
Booked car a week early for a trip to see my elderly mum as it had been too long. Arrived on time to collect, first, the car I booked wasn’t available only a small Fiat, not ideal for 9 hours of motorway driving. Went ahead anyway, produced all documents, dvla code etc then was told they couldn’t rent me a car as I hadn’t passed their id checks. I have no motoring convictions, no criminal record and have been driving for over 37yrs? Walked out in disgust, called Enterprise who sorted me a better car out and was on the road in under half an hour. Do not use this company they will waste your time refuse you rental of a car for no valid reason or explanation and you’ll still have to wait for monies paid to be returned. Terrible experience</div>

Car was picked up in Carcassonne. It was returned in perfect condition and signed off. Some days later, they then took money from my account. No letters, nor any means of contact. On calling them, and this isn't easy, they said I had damaged the car. Further phone calls were put on hold and they never come back. Without doubt, this is a ploy to not have to deal with you any further, in the hope you will go away. I have all the photos and the car in in perfect condition. They still have my money. This company needs to be investigated for what I believe to be fraud. On checking I see this happens frequently. TAKE YOUR CUSTOM ELSEWHERE.</div>

Update.. you are sending the same automated response to every customer that complains.
6 hours later still no response!!

I have been waiting on a hire car coming from Europcar (Belfast branch) from last Tuesday. A hire car was requested via Motability, I have had a number or calls and text messages from Europcar saying a hire car would be delivered to me but still nothing.

On Tuesday of this week I was told a car would be with me be 4.30pm it did not arrive, yesterday I was told a car would be delivered by 1.30pm again no car arrived. I called in the afternoon and was told they don't have a car to give me and they book a car for me each day in the hope they have one.

This morning Thursday (9 days later) I have been on hold for 16 minutes to be cut off and told no one is available to take my call and to call back later.

I have made a formal compliant to Motability about the service you provide!!!</div>

                <div class='text'>Picked up a car from Almería airport in October. Had loads of damage on it ranging from scratches in almost every panel and a cracked binnacle.
Lots of damages declared on pick up. Took loads of photos. Sent them to them. Returned car back in same state.
Back home for five weeks now and they’ve charged me over £600 for damage. No notification. No invoices. No proof of any damage done by me. Absolutely nothing. Nobody inspected the car when I picked it up or dropped it off. It’s cheaper that way for them having to employ people to check them in your presence. Just a sneaky charge on my credit card. Seems to me they bill everyone for damage, and never fix any of it. Basically the customer actually paying for the car they rent out.
The car had over 50k on the clock. It’s clearly a well used car.
To be honest, there was that many scratches and dents on it, it was hard to match up what there was on the paperwork.
Now I’m going through the pain of trying to get it back through my credit card.
Nothing but crooks. They may as well dipped their hand in to my wallet.
***update-***
I challenged this charge and they come back to me with a refund. They haven’t actually told me what I was being charged for and they took over £600. It’s now taking up to 12 working days to refund it. If you ever hire a car, take pictures of ANY damage. No matter how small. Or how much. If there’s a lot reject it. (I should’ve done this). This car had so much damage on it, it was hard to distinguish what they actually declared. Mainly small dents , scuffs and scratches. And make sure you email them as soon as possible with the damage. Luckily I sent mine within 24 hrs and they had a time stamp which they asked for again. Hirer beware. Would even be advisable to take pictures when you hand it back to save any grief. Like the two weeks I’ve had dealing with this.
Goldcar is next door to them in the terminal. I’m going back to them next time in Almeria.
If you honestly don’t contribute to any further damage and they bill you weeks later (like in my case) challenge it. I can’t believe I’m the first and won’t be the last.
Good luck and happy holidays. This put a sour taste to the end of mine.</div>

                <div class='text'>I rent cars on a regular basis all over the world and my experience with Euopcar has been one of the most disappointing I have ever had. I feel like they have ripped me off by using a bait and switch on my chosen vehicle.
On perusing one of the aggregator websites,I was drawn to Europcar who were advertising a Mercedes GLA. The price was towards the higher side but I selected it as this is a vehicle I am specifically interested in.
Not unsurprisingly, there was none available when I arrived to collect my vehicle. I was told that they don't actually rent out the Mercedes GLA, as it is soley used as a standby/emergency vehicle for when one of the other Mercedes products breaks down. That means that they never intended to rent the advertised vehicle and then they hide behind their T&C to provide another vehicle.
To add insult to injury, the "other" vehicle turned out to be an Audi Q2. This car is not even close to being in the same league. In fact, you will not see the Q2 advertised on their website because they would have to attach a publically visible value to it, which would reveal their malfeasance. Of course, all of this is allowed under their T&C and they remain the final arbiters of what is fair...
To be fair, their staff were friendly, pick up and drop off were straight-forward - pretty much a vanilla experience apart from the fact that they provided me with a cheap and nasty substitute vehicle.</div>

                <div class='text'>Avoid like the plague. I lost the keys to my rental and received zero help from the branch. Was left stranded on a bank holiday and had to arrange recovery myself. 6 months later received a letter from a solicitor asking for payment of a £1028.53 charge. I contacted Europcar who has failed to send any correspondence to me despite having me phone, email and address. They refused to share the itemized bill for repair from the dealership who provided the new key. Stating I only have access to the bill from them. No proof that it cost Europcar £1028.53 for a replacement key. Shortsighted. I now use Hertz regularly even when the quote is higher and I've had zero issues from them.</div>

                <div class='text'>ITALY previous review warnings sadly were very accurate Firstly I always use Europcar and have found them to be excellent, but on reading reviews for Italy i used them for the first and last time with caution.
Was given a guaranteed on line booking price inclusive of VAT. Collected the car and made no changes. On return to the UK i was charged an additional £450 and VAT. On questioning this i was advised a GUARANTEED PRICE changes to an approximate price when you sign for the vehicle -
No explanation as to why
Wasn't warned of this and would say that's rather misleading.
FUEL scam
Being prior warned I took photographs of the fuel tank prior to filling on filling and return Admittedly i drove 35k in a Hybrid to drop off Brindisi airport.
Was told i had to replace the fuel for the 35km used.
I refused the traffic was bad and i didn't have time.
My final bill stated the vehicle was 2/8 empty & was charged for refueling at Eur22 plus 11Lts of fuel - in a Hybrid ??? amazing
Have complained and received an immediate reply "we will look into the fuel issue" and you signed an approximate price contract
A month later with follow up mails ....no response "like pulling teeth"
If using Europcar Italy suggest you take photographs</div>

                <div class='text'>Worst car rental company.
I booked a car through their own website (directly and not third party) and when I went to their office to collect the car l, they declined to give the car without explaining the reason. It was 11 pm and no other car rental companies were open so I can get another car. After a long journey this was the cherry on the cake. I have to pay for a taxi and wait under the rain for some time just because I trusted this company and not sure if they give a refund or not.
Not suggested. DO NOT try this company. Waste of time and money.</div>

                <div class='text'>PLEASE don't use this company - there are many others around!
I hired a car - it broke down - it happens!
I telephoned for help - they were useless at attempting to help - they put me through to the AA who could not help!! - they put me through to Kwik Fit - who said to call back on Monday as they were closed!!
It was an absolute joke!
I received a parking fine as I was 'parked' for too long as the motorway services given that EuropCar breakdown assistance was non-existent.
They then charged me £40 admin fee for the Parking Ticket above.
The Customer Services team members are useless.
They lie to you and do not help you.
You write emails and telephone for answers, refunds & compensation - nothing happens!
So, do yourself a favour for the sake of your sanity - use another company.
UPDATE:
Europcar have given an 'auto-response' to the TrustPilot Review but if they even care to check their email systems & phone logs and ask their CEO they will find the details of the complaint.</div>

                <div class='text'>I am a Motability customer and have had to have 3 ev loan cars from this company in the last 6 months due to ongoing issues with my Motability vehicle. No problem with the 1st car I had from them BUT, the last 2 bookings have gone disastrously wrong:

The 2nd car, an EV, had a faulty battery which wouldn't hold its charge and consequently had virtually no range.

After approximately 4 hours of continuous calling and timed-out disconnections, I finally managed to get through to someone at Europcar who advised it couldn't be replaced until the AA had been called out. I was supposed to be transferred to the AA however I was just routed back to the main Europcar switchboard and had to wait a further 40 minutes before I spoke to someone. I asked for a direct number and eventually managed to get through to the AA, who then advised that they wouldn't be able to sort the battery issue and that I needed to re-call Europcar. After some negotiation and having explained Europcar's refusal to replace without a mechanic's report, the AA agreed to have a mechanic call. He duly arrived and advised the car needed to go back to Europcar for repair. He called Europcar, advised them that he was from the AA and that the car needed replacing.... they told him they couldn't help and that he needed to call the AA!!!! He was shocked. Between us, we agreed to drive down to the (Exeter City) branch to try to sort something out. Again, after some negotiation they agreed to provide another vehicle, however they wouldn't have a suitable car until later that day. They promised to call me when it was available so that I could drive back down and collect it that day. I NEVER received a call back. I attempted to contact the branch direct for updates on its availability later in the day, but they just picked up the phone and immediately put it down again. I ended up having to drive down to the branch the following day - fortunately the replacement vehicle was on the forecourt. I challenged the member of staff on duty about the lack of communication. He could not offer any reason as to why I hadn't been contacted and was totally unapologetic for all of the inconvenience, stress and anger Europcar's inactions had caused. NB the replacement car provided was also damaged.

The 3rd car - I'll keep this brief.....! What Car? Europcar were notified at the beginning of the month that I would need a car for today, 18 November. I got a call from them 3 days before to discuss my needs, and was advised that ev cars were in short supply but that they should be able to source something and would let me know. Guess what - no contact from them and I ended up calling them this morning. Something must have been wrong, as I only had to wait 15 minutes before connecting with the branch, who actually answered this time without putting the phone down immediately. They advised that Motability had contacted them to cancel the contract due to "a lack of suitable vehicle availability". They LIED - I contacted Motability RAC who checked their records and advised that it was EUROPCAR who had cancelled, not them. The RAC then took new details, and I am now waiting to hear back from Europcar for a new loan car. This of course, has directly impacted on not only me, but the dealership as they now do not have a car to repair.

This company is APPALING and I'd suggest that anyone looking to hire a vehicle avoids Europcar like the plague.</div>

                <div class='text'>Faceless staf and company! They don't accept the conditions of booking, from the moment enter their office, they are strongly pressed to choose a more expensive car, to buy various funny and expansive additional services, combinations with documents, lying about the price etc.
You can be sure that in the end you will pay more than you thought - you just don't know it yet...</div>

                <div class='text'>My husband booked a car to try and get back to see his father who had a stroke we booked and paid in full when he arrived at Shannon airport the desk was shut. He had to stay in a hotel overnight. Get cabs back-and-forth to the airport. I could not get through to any customer service anyone I did was so rude and unhelpful. The only person that helped us was a lady called Joyce🎉 who I am very grateful to, I would recommend no one booking with your car as we have been customers for over 15 years and will never use them again</div>

                <div class='text'>No customer service!

I spoke to an agent midweek to make an inquiry about car rental. Nadia was extremely helpful and gave me a great price and a reference number so I could call and confirm the booking. I called several times to try and confirm the booking but each time the agent hung up on me half way through the call!

As we live close to the depot we drove to the depot to confirm the booking and collect the car

The agent at the depot refused to accept my quote and quoted me over 4 times the original cost!!!

When I queried the price I was told to either call again or book online. Online would result in a 4 hour wait apparently...

I needed the car immediately to visit my very poorly elderly Mother.

Epic fail Europcar!</div>

                <div class='text'>Booked a van to assist with moving flat. They cancelled within less than 45 minutes prior to pick up. They couldn’t have cared less. And offered NO solution. I was left stranded. Furthermore, they took my money and claimed a refund would take up to 14 days!!! I made a complaint and the email I received took ZERO responsibility and even blamed me for the booking errors. Offered no solution and certainly no compensation for my time and money that I wasted.</div>

                <div class='text'>Terrible. Im out £1500. Booked in January, paid by credit card, paid credit card in full. Changed booking in July, reduced rental to a £400 car. Were emailed confirmation of change and that initial payment of £1500 would be refunded, and they took the new booking value of £400. No refund came through though. Have spoken with several members of the customer service, were told refund would be 10 days, then 28 days, then that no refund was due as it was a 'pre-payment'. Their own customer service team dont know the difference between a pre-payment (take funds) and a pre-auth (reserve funds).
They have denied my credit card the company the refund, so Ive lost £1500. Will never use them again, and will actively encourage anyone I meet to avoid using them.</div>

IT SEEMS THEY CHARGE FOR THE FUEL USED BY THEIR DRIVER WHEN RETURNING THE CAR TO THIER DEPOTS, I add their driver took the longest route possible when returning to the depot.
Apart from this everything was fine with the car and its a real pity my giving a 1 star review.</div>

                <div class='text'>From start to finish, one of the worst experiences with a company I have ever had. It's hard to know where to begin to be honest, but suffice to say I will never, ever, be using Europcar again.

For a start, I was give a completely different car to what I ordered. I prefer a smaller car for easier parking and I was pressured into taking a fairly large SUV. Generally the experience with the car during the rental was ok. However, when I returned it, there was no one around and no spaces in any of the bays. There was one space in another company's area, but of course all the bays were tiny (although the same as Europcars) and I struggled to park it, which was an unbelievably stressful experience.

Two weeks later, I was sent an invoice for £331!! According to Europcar I left a scratch on the car (which I didn't see at the time and to be honest, I'm still skeptical it may have occurred by someone else moving it because when I called up the next day after returning the car the Europcar rep said everything was fine and the charge on my credit card was dropped).

Furious about the whole situation, I complained and was told an investigation was underway. For several months I heard nothing, and assumed it had been dropped. Only to then receive an email from their solicitors requesting the money, with a £40 late fee and an order to pay within 14 days or risk legal proceedings. Of course I have tried and tried to find a solution via email and on the phone, but in the end it's like talking to a wall so I decided to pay the invoice to avoid this dragging on any further.

Now I am in trouble because my cover only reimburses cases if their claim is made 45 days from the day of the rental. This is a separate company, but this situation would have been avoided had they contacted me about the investigation earlier.

As said, this has been truly awful and this review barely scratches the surface. I feel completely robbed, and mistreated but I suppose they don't care because they have their money.</div>

                <div class='text'>Awful. Upon delivery, they didn’t give me a full tank of fuel when it comes to collecting the vehicle the car had 20 miles less than when it was given to me but this is due to the fact that on the Friday, I had planned to go and put £10 in to take it up to what it had when they delivered the vehicle but they had then informed me the vehicle was uninsured. I wasn’t able to get hold of a Jerry Can I tried multiple times. Not much I can do the do expect risk being caught driving with no insurance. I explained this to the man and he said that’s fine. I will explain. I then wake up on the Saturday to find they had took A full tank of fuel out of my account and they wasn’t even concerned that they had cancelled the insurance basically saying to me that I should have drove the vehicle uninsured when at the top of my road there is an ANPR camera that would’ve flagged no insurance and they would’ve been quick enough to send the police to my door disgusting behaviour considering it was a courtesy car whilst my mums mobility car was off-road. They would’ve been happy for it to fall back on my shoulders driving uninsured meaning I could have potentially been put on a driving ban or worse time in jail. I will be lodging a formal complaint. This is just that everyone knows that you like to cancel insurances. By the looks of it it is an shocking company with really bad reviews so I’m not overly surprised to be honest with their behaviour, if I could avoid using them I would, but unfortunately mobility only work with them so in need of a replacement vehicle I am stuck with them</div>

                <div class='text'>Worse hire car company ever. A car was booked by lease car company for a hire car whilst mine was going to dealers for a repair. Europcar were booked to deliver car to dealers for 8 am on 12th November. From the leeds branch. Firstly you cannot get thro to this office to pay a £1 deposit for a car. Secondly i have rung euro car 3 times each time it has been someone who could do with going on a customer service course. The final person I spoke to at 13:10 today hung up the phone line when I ask for Europcar complaints number. I spoke to one advisor that said to me the reviews are rubbish . I said does this include mine he stated probably. The company has no accountability. I have already submitted a complaint to yourself. I would suggest speaking to leeds branch given there unprofessional comments to customers. “Online reviews are rubbish, does that include my review of service. Europcar leeds response most likely too”</div>

                <div class='text'>I recently booked a car with Eurocar. I went along to collect the car where the experience turned sour. The Darlington, County Durham branch asked me to test my drivers licence by using the Gov Uk licence check website. This website didn't validate my details and the form failed to do the checks after multiple tries. The assistant at the time just stood there and said 'the checks failed'. With a growing queue behind me and a blank stare from the assistant, I walked out.

I find Eurocar most unhelpful. I won't be hiring from them again in future.</div>

                <div class='text'>Not one to typically write reviews but this is definitely the worst car rental company I have ever dealt with. Rented a car for a day - pick up from Heathrow. Picked up the car quickly but was not given a damage report on collection so decided to take a video. Returned the car and a new "minor scuff" was noted on the post collection report. Proved this was there on the video I took but the company kept on coming with all kinds of excuses not to accept this - either the damage was too small to see or there was no time stamp to it (sent the entire video with geotagging and time stamp!). Absolute rip off. Just now noticing plenty of similar reviews online. Do yourselves a favour and find a professional rental company.</div>

                <div class='text'>An update.
After returning a car to Guildford Audi that was hired for me from Europcar as well as charging me for their delivery and pickup fuel, they now claim that I have cracked a windscreen.
This company try anything they can to screw extra money out of their customers.
If you have to use Europcar, you should take photographs of every part of a car on pickup and when you return it.
This is not a trustworthy company. I advise you not to use them. I am in contact with Audi, asking them not to hire any cars from Europcar as there are many other car rental companies who do not rip off their customers.</div>

                <div class='text'>Picked up my prepaid rental from Manchester Airport. Unbeknownst to me my prepayment of $395, booked through American Express, was not acknowledged by Europcar. At pickup I was immediately offered 2 different cars than my original reservation, my first question was “will these cost more”, the response was “no”.

FLEECED!!!!!
Europcar are refusing to refund any of the upgrade charges based on my claim that I was told there would not be an additional charge. Shame on me for taking their word for there not being an up charge and double shame on me for thinking that they would take my word that they said no additional charge.</div>

                <div class='text'>Had a confirmed booking for a rental car in Sheffield, UK, and car was not there. Offered an upgrade for more money, unwilling to let me have it for same price as my booking. Was told my car would arrive later same day, but by the time the office closed, (6 hours after reservation time), it was still not confirmed when or if the car would be arriving. Three calls to central office resulted in unhelpful, unsupportive service where as a customer, I was shown no respect, apology for company error or attempt to remedy the mistake. One representative engaged in an argument with me.</div>

                <div class='text'>It’s a shame because the pick up and four days of hire were great. Customer facing staff at branch were also friendly both at pick up and drop off. It is what has happened after drop off which I can only suggest borders on criminal. So far a payment authorisation each week of £139 has been taken against my debit card after returning the van two weeks ago. I can only suggest that they continue to use the initial card authorisation I gave them when approving the deposit to be held. Their representatives can’t see why they would be taking this amount each week as there is nothing on the rental agreement suggesting they should but it doesn’t stop it from coming out of my account and depleting my available funds somewhat illegally. I have had to open a case and been asked to send them statements so that they can investigate. In addition to this they also tried to charge for fuel when I had filled it up just before dropping off which the chap at the drop off desk reminded me to do. No exaggeration the petrol station is next door as they share the car park. They have since said a refund is coming back to me for this due to “lack of documentation” but it’s pretty shameful that someone thought to try it on to start. Fingers crossed they sort the weekly illegal card authorisations without me needing to cancel my cards with the bank.</div>

                <div class='text'>Very strange as this hire company sent me a text message 2 weeks after I had returned the car, claiming there was damage to the vehicle. Luckily I had taken a video of the condition of the car inside and out, and there was no damage when I left it at the dealership. A few days after I dropped the hire car at the garage, Europcar finally collected it and yet did not mention any damage, in fact they sent a video they took on collection and the car looks fine *although having compared their footage to mine, they had taken the video after driving it as the fuel gauge was slightly less than as I left it.

The notification from Europcar was sent by text message and there is no option to reply.

A call to their customer services ended up with someone in Morocco who refused to clarify what the damage apparently is, stating it is not relevant, they also refused to put me through to a supervisor or manager or arrange a callback from them. I felt entirely at the mercy of someone who simply told me they were investigating!
Either this is a scam or Europcar are attempting to charge customers for unspecified 'damage' to vehicles, weeks after they are returned!</div>

                <div class='text'>Picked up my prepaid rental from Manchester Airport. Unbeknownst to me my prepayment of $395, booked through American Express, was not acknowledged by Europcar. At pickup I was immediately offered 2 different cars than my original reservation, my first question was “will these cost more”, the response was “no”. I signed paperwork whichI should have paid more attention to but was assured it was just a few initials to complete reservation and insurance details. After I dropped the vehicle off my American Express was charged an additional $926. American Express took the case but I have only received my $395 back.

                <div class='text'>STAY AWAY!! Contracted for a 6 day rental with 1500 miles. Had to extend by one day due to train delays, cost an extra 40 quid, OK, no problem. Turns out, by extending 1 day to a 7 day rental, my mileage was reduced to 600 miles, and 900 miles of extra mileage fees also had to be paid. Extra 153 quid on top of the rental fees. Why in the world an extra day REDUCES mileage is a complete mystery except that Europcar grabs money that way.
Full disclosure: the staff at Royal Park were great, very friendly, but the HQ for this company is a scam.</div>

                <div class='text'>We rented a car from Europcar in Belgium after renting in multiple other countries, including the Netherlands just a month before.
We used a credit card in my wife’s name on all these other occasions, no issue. Belgium wouldn’t accept it. Fine, it’s the T&C and you want to be strict on it here for some reason. No where else has ever had an issue with it, no where.

What is abysmal, is the service received from the 2 people on the desk that day.
There was no empathy, no understanding and no desire at all to help. They were rude and dismissive.
One even asked for my phone to look at the reservation, there was me thinking of they will try and help. No she wanted it to highlight again how I was in the wrong.

The service was shocking, I have never been treated like this before. No desire to help. These people should not be in people facing jobs.

we’ll be avoiding any Europcar hires in the future for our trips</div>

                <div class='text'>Absolutely disgusting treatment by this so called company. An arranged hire car through motability was delivered to me at the dealership which quarter the fuel tank had been used when I received it. No paperwork or anything was signed. She handed keys, I took photos of the car as proof there was scrape marks on the vehicle already. The woman who delivered it seemed a little edgy. I used the hire car a handful of times and then filled it back up to where it was when I handed the keys. I dropped it at the dealership and the recptionist told me she would arrange the collection for me and she took the keys off me. A WEEK later I had notification It had been collected by Europcar. They then billed me for £30 fuel used!! I disputed this but then became too tired to continue and paid it, stupidly. Now 2 MONTHS later they have filed a claim against me for damage to the vehicle!! I am being chased for £100 excess for damage I DID NOT do. The damage in question was already on the vehicle when I was handed the keys. I took photos of the car when I dropped it off and uploaded them onto the Europcar link they had sent me. So they DO have the photos before and after showing the exact same damage already there and no further damages. UNLESS, the dealership had caused damage between the week of me dropping it off and Europcar collecting it. Either way, I did NOT cause any damage what so ever, or the delivery woman damaged it on the way to dropping it off as apparently no damage was recorded before I had it. convenient!!! I refuse to pay for someone elses damage. NOT a chance. I will take this all way the way and as far as it goes. They uploaded their own images and I uploded my images to them. So they have the images I sent them regardless. They are liars, unprofessional money grabbers preying on motability customers. DO NOT ACCEPT EUROPCAR HIRE.</div>

                <div class='text'>We recently had to use this abysmal company, via nobility.
Not only did they provide an unsuitable vehicle, (how do you get a disabled person and wheelchair in a Fiat 500?), they were constantly unavailable by phone for over a day. When we eventually got through there was no kind of help or assistance!
I can only say I will never use this company again.

Beware of the cowboy customer service as they really have no clue and dont want to help!! I am disgusted at the service!

                <div class='text'>Very mixed experience with Hire Car in Slovenia...
Very slow service when collecting the car - almost 30 minutes !!. The car was great however the biggest issue was returning the car to the Ljubljana downtown 'office'
BEWARE - The return location is 15 minutes walk from the car park, the instructions for the car park are inadequate which resulted in a detour around Ljubljana in rush hour traffic, the car park does not have any specific signage for where to park the car.
Once we had waked to the office and mentioned the above the agent was very apathetic regarding our issues.
To top it all off the car was inspected within 15 minutes of us returning the keys so someone must have driven out to do that.
There was adequate parking outside the key return office so the car could have been returned there easily.
Need to improve this massively.</div>

                <div class='text'>Really poor. I had to pick up the car from a different terminal, was given an inferior car to what i booked and then found it very hard to return the car as i didn't have access to the parking! Also, the price that Europcar charges for children's seats is ludicrous. It's cheaper to go to the local Tesco and buy one than rent a car seat for a day!

What's more, Europcar responded me to get in touch directly after my Google review and funnily enough the website kept crashing when i tried to submit it.

As a last straw i called them but they weren't able to take feedback on the phone.

It sounds like they just don't want to hear it.</div>

                <div class='text'>Europcar supplied a replacement car through my insurance company when mine was shifted from behind and written off. This happened on a Friday. The following Monday I had to drive from my home in Cornwall to Gloucestershire with my cat who was going to a specialist hospital for treatment, while I stayed nearby in a B&B.

Europcar Truro texted me on the Monday saying that my hire car would be delivered between 12 and 2. I had bee trying to call them all morning to bring it forward as I had to be in Gloucester by 5pm. They don’t answer this phones. They don’t even play music or have a message telling you that you are in aqueue….they just play you an advertisement over and over.

My insurance company did manage to contact them though, and Europcar called me shortly before 2pm. They told me that an MGHS has bee booked out to me and was on its way. This car never arrived. I then received another text saying that my car would be with me between 3 and 5. Shortly before 6pm the driver turned up with the smaller MGZS. I wasn’t able to fit all of my luggage plus cat crate into this so I had to leave some things behind.

Returning the hire car is proving to be similarly difficult., largely because EuRopcar never answer their phones. I tried to call them several times during the week to talk to the about the return, but they don’t answer. As I am typing my insurer is also attempting to contact them. The have promised to call the, back, but that was over an hour ago. If I can’t return the cat today I am going to have to pay for another night at the B&B and another night for the cat at the veterinary hospital. I have also tried to call the Bristol branch to see if I can drop the car off there but they don’t answer either, and after 20 minutes of listening to their advent they cut you off with a message that just says “ sorry there is no one here to answer you call”.

They treat human beings with contempt. I am disabled and things like this have a very negative effect on my physical health. I hope that NFU Mutual and other car insurers will stop using them. Had I known that they would cause me this many problems I would have hired a car from somewhere else at my own expense.</div>

                <div class='text'>Counter staff lied about the terms of rental agreement and failed to respond to any requests.
Alternatively also hired vehicle from Enterprise and highly recommend. Professional, courteous staff and superior standard of vehicle. Customer service provided at both pick up and drop off locations was exceptional.

Thank you for the option to contact your customer services. Done that and you hide behind clauses and contracts. Why would I bother to log a request if I truely did not believe the information provided to me was correct. Numerous requests to speak with the relevant branch gone unanswered.
Having since read a number of other customer reviews it seems I am not the only customer who has been scammed by your staff. Recommend potential customers go to Enterprise for superior vehicles and customer service.</div>

                <div class='text'>I have had a very bad experience with Europcar.
I booked a Car via third party Called Economy bookings.
I received car rental voucher which clearly stated that the basic insurance was included.
When i attended the Manchester Airport Europcar branch I was told by them that there is no basic insurance included and i would have to buy one.
On speaking to Economy bookings they wanted to speak to Europcar Representative , who was very dismissive when he spoke to Economy bookings representative, not only clearly declined their input but he was affirmative that their is no insurance on the price i have already paid.
I had to pay extra to buy the insurance.
On my rental it stated as Selection protect as an extra when I eventually bought it than.
On returning the car, they found some sprinkles from a clothing,on the interior Suede of the car seats and they sent me a separate invoice to clean that, which I found really uncalled for.

So now i did pay extra for selection protect which was sold to me as basic insurance and also i have been sent another invoice for the carwash.
Price of £172.84 for a clean which was outrageous.

I have been back and forth both with Europcar and Economy bookings and had no joy in achieving anything.

Following your generic response to my review:
I have already a number of times flagged with customer service , the reason i came up on Trustpilot was dissatisfaction and disappointment to the overall service I received from Poor coordination on the desk to invoice generated for me.</div>

                <div class='text'>We rented a car for a week at Edinburgh Airport and got a MG ZS. The penultimate day of our rental, on our way to our accomodation, we had to stop due to a road closure. After the closure was lifted, we were not able to ignite the car again. This was some time around 8 pm. After calling the Europcar service, it took 2 hours for the technician to arrive. Apparently the immobilizer was active, some kind of software malfunction, happening for reasons not even he could explain. We were ready to go again some minutes before midnight, lost therefore our hotel reservation, where check in was till 10pm only. Our flight back home was the next morning and since we were scared this might happen again, we decided to return directly to Edinburgh Airport spending the rest of the night (arrival time was after 1am) at the parking lot. Needless to emphasize the inconvenience caused.

Due to this, it seemed adequate to ask for a refund for the caused trouble, since if any fault is caused by the costumer Europcar would not hesitate to bill the extra expenditures. But all we got offered was a lousy 10% discount on our next booking. An offer like this + the fact, that europcar is expanding its fleet with low quality chinese cars will make us seriously rethink renting anytime again from Europcar.

I for myself cannot recommend renting with them.</div>

                <div class='text'>When we picked up the car we said we did not want any extra insurance etc - we did pay for an extra driver. I was asked to sign the form about additional extras, and noticed there was a charge on it of 3 pounds per day - I asked what that was, and was told it was VAT on the extra driver. I foolishly signed - only to see later it was for something I had not requested (emergency travel service - no idea what that is). The staff member had not printed his name on the form (as required) but did sign to say he had explained the extra product to me - he never mentioned it! I contacted Europcar by email the next day (phoning was not getting me anywhere) and informed them of this. They replied saying leave it until you return the car. At the car return they said we cannot help but contact head office again and you will get a refund. In the end they said I had signed and they could not check what was said, so the money was gone - even though I had contacted them the day after to inform them I did not want this (on a 7 day rental).
I have the impression Europcar UK staff are encouraged, or at least permitted, to mislead customers and charge extra - and they well get bonuses for this. Not trustworthy at all!

Europcar responded by suggesting that I give them "a chance to solve the issue" by contacting their customer service. This is their standard response and sounds good - except I have already exchanged several emails with their customer service dept - they started off offering to help, but in the end said they would not refund the money wrongly charged. I do not expect more correspondence will change that. It was not really a very good service for customers.</div>

                <div class='text'>Absolute disgrace of a company. They rented me an electric car that didn’t charge. As a result I missed my 12:55pm flight back to London from Lisbon and waited 4.5hrs for the car to be picked up and taken to the airport. I got home 11hrs after I was meant to and €538 poorer (€437.48 on the new flight and €101 on the taxi home. Through absolutely no fault of my own, and ENTIRELY the fault of the faulty car that Europcar hired to me, I spent €538 and was 11 hours delayed, and they wouldn't compensate me for the cost? How is that fair? They gave me €39 for the car hire and offered NO EXPLANATION FOR WHY. Absolutely fuming. Disgraceful disgraceful company.</div>

                <div class='text'>The original problem with Europcar happened May 18 but was in conjunction with Mercedes and carried on for 5 months. Europcar had a simple task - to deliver a hire car to a Mercedes dealership in Pembroke where we waiting as our car needed attention. All agreed at noon and advised ETA of 14-20 pm. No car had arrived at 15-30 so obviously called to enquire. Told that they would contact the driver to confirm ETA. The news was somewhat baffling - no car had been dispatched and this was down to Mercedes not approving the order. Their suggestion was that a taxi would take us to Swansea - a trip of say 2 hours - and we could then drive back to our hotel - another 90 mins. We obviously declined the offer and our hire car eventually arrived at our hotel Sunday mid morning. Over the next 5 months dealing with Mercedes Benz Customer Service, it became very clear that the excuse about the non arrival of the car being down to MB was a complete lie. So Europcar came up with another excuse. That also was a complete lie. But good luck to Europcar they just kept going and came up with another excuse this time blaming us that our credit card details had not arrived in time. Hey,ho in seconds we managed to send visual evidence that this third attempt was also a lie. In the end, MB after 5 months of deliberation finally, finally realised that they were being lied to and the case was
sorted in our favour. In a way, I was a little disappointed when it ended because it was just fascinating to try and guess what Europcar would create as their next excuse. Bad ethics, no apologies - Europcar is a Company to avoid at all costs. There are lots of hire companies out there and my advise is to choose any other than Europcar. Very easy to see why their customer ratings are so low. Almost impossible to try and fathom why Mercedes has chosen them as a partner. Apologies for long note - cathartic...

Got the standard response from Europcar giving me an email address to respond. Tried that and the address is blocked. You just could not make this stuff up. Total shambles...</div>

                <div class='text'>We rented a car in the summer for 24 days and then I rented again in September for 9 days. The price was almost the same for the 9 days as it was for nearly a month. For 24 days in August, plus an extra driver, we paid £1,183.61, and in September we paid £1,115.60 for 9 days.
I was quoted a price that seemed reasonable at the time as the car we had reserved wasn't available. It turns out the cost quoted was on top of the previous quote not a new price. We are waiting for them to respond to Resolver but it has been over a month and no response. I wouldn't recommend them at all. We are seriously out of pocket.</div>

                <div class='text'>My less that 2yr old Nissan car was taken by RAC Saturday 26th due to a motor and electrical breakdown, I fully understand the office was closed the weekend so I patiently waited for a call. Monday morning 28th at 8.45am I received a call from Europcar to say someone will be in touch within 24hr hours regarding getting me back ok the road, Tuesday 29th lunchtime arrived no call, I spent ages on hold for upto 20minutes before being disconnected and had to call back, I was finally told at 2pm a car would be delivered 6pm that day, 5.30pm (30minutes before my allocation delivery time) I missed a call as was at work, a voicemail was left to say this has been pushed back to Wednesday 30th and someone would call me, I have spent all morning trying to contact the team whilst trying to enjoy a planned day out with my children to be told again someone will call me back but after again waiting, I called them myself at 6.40pm, after being passed from person to person to be told surprise surprise this has again been pushed back to Thursday 31st and I will receive yet another call even though I am the one who has been chasing them. I am now approaching day 4 without a car. I am unsure why when my loan car is being dealt with and coming from Liverpool branch they have no car available yet if I go on their website there is around 6/8 that would be suitable for collection. I have 3 children one of which registered disabled and told I will not be left without a vehicle well unfortunately this was false information and I have been left with no car!</div>

                <div class='text'>I hired a car through easyjet at the cost of £244 and thus included premium insurance. When I went to pick car up from Glasgow Airport branch I was scammed from the minute I walked through the door. The young chap with a beard didn't even want to see my car hire voucher as he said he had it on his computer. Asked what car I drove normally I said an automatic as I have rhymathoid arthritis but for a week I would only need a manual which I had booked. Told me he would give me an automatic at no extra cost as I had a disability also said my daughter could be an additional driver in case I wasn't able to drive while I was visiting family. I did sign a form after he said it was a holding deposit which would all be returned after I dropped car off( they took £903 out my account). He folded up paper and put into envelope I made a point in say you haven't charged me any extra have you as my reading eyesight isn't good. Reply not at all madam. Enjoy your stay, dropped car off flowing Monday 14th Oct . Next day I found out they had taken out £653 out of my account for upgrade, young driver addition my daughter is 25. I have complained and told that because I signed it's my fault. They have scammed me out of this money by playing on my disability and poor reading eyesight. So I have just paid £900 for a hire car for a week which is absolutely terrifying. I could have got taxis everywhere cheaper than this. It is shocking what people are prepared to do to vulnerable people who are honest and hardworking. Glasgow branch seems to be good at doing this. I will never use or recommend them ever again. If I don't get my money back I will contact watchdog and the ombudsman. Playing on someone's disability is shocking. If I could I would give them zero stars</div>

                <div class='text'>Awful experience.
Incorrect size van. Painful time consuming process to get a van anywhere close to the size I booked. Charged for excess miles after inaccurate pick up miles recorded.
Needed to move furniture 2.45m in length. Booked a medium size van internal length 2.93m on website. Went on live chat to confirm that if it was a “similar van” it would still be the same internal length.
Was told the length on the website was an error, but all their medium vans are 2.862m so it would be that.
I was emailed less than 2 days before pick up, after free cancellation period advising the van was 1.75m. This was below the amount I needed so called customer services. They said this is an error and I would get the van I needed. Contacted the Norwich office to double check, they said it was extremely unlikely they’d have a van I needed, but would “upgrade” me to a larger van. The larger van was no use, as in excess of the maximum weight limit for my licence. This was initially dismissed, then accepted that this was correct, I was told I would get a smaller van. I asked to confirm that this would be a minimum of 2.5m in internal length, they said they couldn’t guarantee this. I explained that it has to be 2.5m or it’s not use to me. I was told they’d call me back. Six hours later following receiving no call back I chased. Was told they had managed to get a van and it would be 2.5m in length. A total of 7 calls and 45 minutes on the phone.
Picked up the van fine, no issue with the van, it was 2.5m in length, although not the 2.862m I had initially booked. This meant due to the angle the seats came out at I needed to do an extra trip as the furniture needed to be on its back rather than on its side, so only 1 could fit at a time rather than 2. This added 2 hours and 45 miles to my day.
I could have ignored all this, but to top it off.
Returned the van and was emailed a statement of return. The pick up miles were incorrect. I contacted to explain and sent a photo as evidence. I was told that it didn’t matter as they hadn’t been charged. The following day I received an invoice confirming the charge for the miles which I didn’t drive.</div>

                <div class='text'>Car booked through Audi UK as a courtesy. It was dropped at off my house with 520 miles in the tank and I was handed paperwork with the outlined recorded damage to the car. Not sure how but they missed off 2 scratches the full length of the passenger side doors which looked to be made by a key, the rear bumper had multiple scratches and chips and 2 of the alloys were heavily scuffed. I rang to report and emailed the photos but I’m in no doubt they would have tried to charge me for this if I’d not done so.
I filled the car up on the day of return and dropped it off at Crewe Audi who made the booking, I took a date/time stamped picture of a full tank with 520 miles. I’ve now received an invoice for £15+ for 7 litres of fuel and when I’ve queried it they told me I’ve been charged for the fuel to get the car back to their Stoke on Trent branch!! Not sure why I’m responsible for this given it was returned with the same fuel level and they’ve also added their inflated petrol fee.
Avoid this company and use Enterprise. If a dealership books a car through Europcar be sure to make the dealership take ownership or refuse it.</div>

                <div class='text'>Terrible away from this company!
I ordered a ford focus online, they rang me saying they haven't got any. So I have to pay extra for the next car up. I paid.
When I went to collect they wouldn't let me have the car because they did a credit check??? Even though I already paid and there is no credit involved in the hire. The refund can take upto 28 days so I had no money to hire elsewhere to get to a my brothers wedding where is was best man. If a credit check is done Is should be before any payment is taken!
Rude, unhelpful staff.
Never again!</div>

                <div class='text'>I rented a car from Europcar Bath on the weekend of September 7th, 2024. I was talked into taking an electric car, which was not what I had booked. 8 times out of 10 the car would not go into "Drive or Reverse", so I could not go anywhere. I contacted the breakdown service recommended by Europcar but he could not fix the problem either. When I contacted head office on Saturday evening, I was told that they could not provide a replacement till Monday morning, which was when the car was due for return.
When I requested a refund I was told that there was nothing wrong with the car!</div>

Be sure to really check your rental agreement before signing it. Nothing you have verbally discussed with the personnel can be trusted.
1. When you enter the office, no one is interested in your reservation or voucher details
2. From the first minute, strong pressure to take a more expensive car and additional services

You can say 10 times that you don't want to pay for any additional services – but you can be sure that you will pay for them anyway. You will find out about it later and no matter what you have agreed with staff.

Their business standards - upselling, bundling, threatening, misleading on our example:
1. Refusal to release the vehicle in accordance with the reservation & voucher
2. Trying to sell a more expensive vehicle rental service
3. If you insist on what you ordered, they will start scaring you and add additional costs for insurance, location, service and something else...
4. If you refuse, you won't get a car, if you believe that there are no fees, they will add them to you later and you will be very disappointed

                <div class='text'>Hired car at Stansted. On arrival, was upselled a higher premium at no extra cost. Constant chatter by salesman with documents written under the counter assuring us that this is ALL free. No opportunity to peruse documents which were placed on counter with his hand on it, asking us to sign here and here. Quickly hustled out to car "to get us on our way" where we were told our car had been upgraded at no extra cost. Was told all money to be returned on return of car if undamaged. Upselling at its worse. Rapid conversation on tired people who have flown extensive hours, making connections with customers stating love to go to Australia I have family there, this is all free making him look such a great bloke, I'm going to upgrade your car, taking our original contract stating we/he don't need it. 2 attempts to take money from our account with no contact on why. DO NOT touch this company.</div>

                <div class='text'>Massive charges for the slightest damage, extortionate. Really poor communication when trying to resolve it and lots of hidden extra charges. The worst of big corporate company behaviour taking advantage of the average customer. Avoid at all costs. To be precise a 3cm superficial, barely visible scratch which they alleged I had caused was charged at approximately 1300 Euros, showed a UK specialist who's stated it should cost maximum £500 . I very much doubt it will be repaired they just take the money. It really feels like I've been scammed. After over a month of emails in which all of their responses were callous and didn't answer my very polite questions, after already extorting 1500 euros, they are still taking more money from my credit card and I'm having to go to the ombudsman just to stop them after trying with the company for over a month. The ombudsman, the ECRCS, found they had mistakenly charged me VAT on the damage - Europcar then took another £1100 from my credit card without refunding me the first charge of £1382. Honestly I didn't find the ombudsman helpful, it felt like they were sponsored by the care hire company. Just don't use Europcar whatever you do they essentially are using any excuse to extort money and you are powerless to stop them.

                <div class='text'>Stay away from them. Similar to other comments here, they might try to scam you. Don’t be fooled by the competitive prices and brand name - this branch is the worst Europcar I’ve personally experienced.

I picked up a car a few minutes before the agreed time which they accommodated. We returned the car 20mins after our contracted drop off time and at the time we were told there’s no issue. However a few days later I got an unrecognised charge from them which they didn’t communicate upfront. Only when I queried it I found out they’ve charged me for an extra day which was surprising considering I’ve stayed within the contractual agreement. In essence they’ll go against what’s stated in the contract to get more money out of you.</div>

                <div class='text'>We rented a car from Keddy Rent a Car which turned out to be Europcar through Car Jet. The original cost of the vehicle was £375 all in which I paid in full. On arrival at the Europcar office at Gatwick I was informed that I would have to pay a £552.16 refundable deposit before I could take the car. My partner handed over his credit card which the lady said it would be blocked on, we told her immediately it had been taken off the credit card but she said it never mind it will be refunded on return of the vehicle. 8 weeks later and still no refund. Going through our paperwork recently we only now have noticed that she didn't take a deposit but rather sold us the most expensive insurance without telling us. It's charged as Premium Protection. Possibly our fault for not noticing it at the time but after travelling for for 19 hours from Cape Town via Dubai to the UK, you are eager to get on the road, so that's the reason we didn't notice that we had been blatantly lied to.
We would still like this matter to be resolved and the lady in question to be charged instead as this is fraud.</div>

                <div class='text'>One of the Most Stressful Car Hire Experiences I've Ever Had - I am all for the change over to electric cars, per say, but by choice and not on this occassion...!
I recently hired a car from Europcar, and it turned out to be one of the most stressful experiences I've ever had. I originally booked a Vauxhall but, to my surprise, was given a fully electric Jeep instead. No one informed me of this change beforehand—there was no notice in my email or on the order. To make matters worse, I was charged an extra £35.
When I arrived to collect the car, I was told there were no other vehicles available, and one of the staff rudely suggested I should just cancel my order. I had an important meeting over 220 miles away and had no choice but to take the car. I had no idea how it worked, and the staff didn’t have a clue either. They didn’t know how many miles I could drive or how to charge it, but they incorrectly assured me that 200 miles would be enough to get me to my destination.
After just 30 miles of driving, and when I figured a couple of things out, I realized the mileage was dropping much faster than expected, and I found myself in a panic, with only 43 miles left and 35 miles to go to the nearest charging station. I called Europcar twice for help and was left on hold for 20 and then 35 minutes! I ended up having to call a local dealership to get information about charging the car, who were so helpful and supportive.
Despite calling Europcar multiple times to ask for a different vehicle, I was told they couldn’t get through to other branches, and I didn’t have time to go hours out of my way to try Plymouth or Exeter locations. I was late to my meeting and to my hotel in Cirencester, which left me stressed and anxious.
The next day, the nightmare continued. The car was at 15% charge in the morning, but I had to drive slowly and risk running out of charge just to make it to my next meeting. Afterward, I drove to two charging stations that were both not working (Shell). I had to go to a third location, which took 20 mins to get to and an hour to charge, and I ended up driving in the dark—a situation that made me even more anxious. I didn’t get home until 9:45 PM, completely exhausted.
I wouldn’t have rented this car if I had been told about the change in advance. The potential breach of contract, misrepresentation, lack of communication, rude staff, and complete lack of knowledge about the vehicle made this an awful experience. I felt unsafe throughout the journey, constantly worried about the mileage and being stranded with no charge. This hire wasted my time, energy, and money. Absolutely terrible service, and I feel upset by how badly this was handled and hope this can be redressed.
Europcar needs to seriously improve their obligation to customer service and communication. If you're thinking of hiring from them, I would advise you to double-check your booking and be prepared for a lot of hassle.

Would not recommend.</div>

                <div class='text'>I originally booked the car through booking.com with their total protection package
On arrival at the office at BHX I was told the total protection package, wasn't with them and I would only have limited cover, they then told me I should ask for a refund from booking.com, and buy their insurance instead.
As I was only on a short stay in the UK, due to fly back to work, I took the agents advice, I had just come off my flight into the UK having been travelling for 12 hours and I didn't want any complications
My original car hire cost through booking.com came to £470.41 with the premium insurance
(Europcar then charged me a further £508 just for their insurance, which I hadn't realised until I got their invoice)
They then took a payment of £800 as a what was described as a security deposit, of which they have taken £708.41
I have contacted their customer service who have told me the £708.41 is the insurance package I signed for
Needless to say I'm not impressed in the slightest

Still waiting for any kind of security deposit to be refunded</div>

                <div class='text'>Vehicle Malfunction: The 2nd day of rental the air conditioner malfunctioned, leaking into the engine causing it to smoke and forcing me to stop roadside. The breakdown service took 2 hours to arrive.

Poor Customer Support: I spent over 3.5 hours trying to get assistance from Europcar's support channels on what to do with the vehicle. I was repeatedly passed between departments, faced poor communication, and was even given incorrect contact information.

Inconvenient Resolution: The only solution offered was for me to make a 5-hour round trip to exchange the vehicle, which I had to arrange on my own initiative.

While a replacement vehicle was eventually provided, the process was arduous and disruptive. Europcar failed to acknowledge the significant inconvenience caused or offer any form of compensation for the time lost and plans disrupted.

Conclusion: I am deeply dissatisfied with Europcar's lack of accountability and the poor level of customer service received.</div>

                <div class='text'>Disappointed with Europcar UK

I recently had a negative experience with Europcar UK during my visit. I was overcharged and faced poor customer service from Petyo Pernichev in Customer Services.

The handling of my rental agreement (156978467) was unprofessional, and the situation has been ongoing for nearly a month. Despite providing evidence to correct the mistake, the reasons for the extra charges kept changing, which was quite shocking.

I am reaching out in hopes of receiving feedback on this matter. Your assistance in resolving this issue would be greatly appreciated.

Sincerely,

Muriel</div>

                <div class='text'>Rented a car which broke down.
The AA restarted the car, after a two-hour delay.
I had just filled the car with petrol.
The AA advised me not to stop again as they weren't confident the problem was resolved. So, I returned the car with the tank 85% full. I explained this to Europcar Kings X.
Europcar wouldn't offer any discount for the problem; and they subsequently charged me for filling the car with fuel.
My experience is that this is a business that is very keen to remind customers of their responsibilities, but less keen on acknowledging their own dismal performance.
It wouldn't surprise me if KW24 LYV was put back on the road without anyone establishing why it failed to start.
Shoddy. Beware.</div>

                <div class='text'>Awful service
Europcar customer service have a complete inability to sort anything out. They also don’t seem to be too bothered about it.
They did not allow me to pick up my car as they said I was blocked on their system. They said I had not submitted the right documents. After I proved I had and they agreed they had received it, they were still unable to provide me with the car. Their excuse was head office was closed over the weekend. I was left stranded at the airport as no other car company had an appropriate car.</div>

                <div class='text'>Booked a car to collect from Dublin airport for a business trip. I collected the car from a dark car park (no lighting). The car looked ok on inspection. However, when I returned the car (flood lit with inspection lamps), the man who came to inspect the car asked about 'the accident'. There had been no accident or incident and I could not explain where it had come from. The was very minor, low down on the front bumper and even if I had seen it on inspection it would have been to minor for me to comment.

The man was very rude and had no interest in resolving the situation.

It is such a shame as I had not used a hire car from an airport before and the car had been really goo. Had I not had such a poor experience returning the car I would have definitely considered this for my next trip.

The cost of the repair was apparently >€500. I suspect there was no work carried out and they will pull this stunt with the next customer.

I was not the only person having trouble returning my car at the same time.

Europcar will be going on our 'bad supplier list' Use Enterprise - their service is excellent!</div>

                <div class='text'>I booked an advertised Volvo XC40 SUV from Marseille airport and on arrival was offered a Renault Mégane in very poor condition, nearly every panel damaged. I refused it as I needed an SUV for all my family's luggage, baby equipment etc, but was told there were none available. This was not true as there was a Toyota RAV 4 SUV parked right outside. They reluctantly gave it to me and after about 100 kms it broke down. I had to return 100 kms to Marseille to pick up a replacement even though there were other nearer branches. They again tried to offer me a Renault Mégane! After a long argument I was finally given an MG SUV. The counter staff were unbelievably rude and the final cost to me was nearly 40% more than expected. I have been hiring cars at Marseille airport for over 35 years and never had a problem, but I have previously used reputable companies like Avis. Never again, don't touch EuropCar.</div>

                <div class='text'>I picked up the car about an hour ago from Bristol Airport. On the way back hom. I noticed the smell of old smoking - obviously someone had been smoking in a previous hire and it was embedded in the car. Didn’t notice it immediately as the car had just been valeted.

I really hate the smell of smoke. And I rarely get a car with this problem.

Unfortunately, I was a long way from the branch when I noticed it and tried to ring the branch - but the number was rejected and then I couldn’t get through to the branch on the 0371 number.

When I finally spoke to someone, she said she would add to the notes so that they knew when I returned the car.

This was unacceptable to me as I don’t want to be in this car for the remainder of my hire.

She told me I could drive the car back to the branch, but they couldn’t guarantee they would have another car in the same category.

Not only did I not want to drive back at my own time and expense, I also didn’t want to go back to the branch who had spent a good 20-30 minutes attempting to upsell me a variety of cars, and then potentially be left having to keep this car.

The call handler then began to raise her voice to me and I had to calmly ask her not to.

She then suggested I could swap it at my nearest branch which is Newport, processing to put me on hold for 12 minutes with no more response.

So I guess I am stuck with the car, with no resolution or compensation.

Therefore, I am giving the lowest possible score.</div>

                <div class='text'>Hired a vehicle online and paid upfront. When we arrived to collect the vehicle we asked for an additional driver to be added in case of an emergency. At no point were we verbally made aware of any additional charges, nor were we made aware in the confirmation email that additional charges may apply for the additional driver, and when we asked about the breakdown of the costs on the rental agreement we were told "this summarises what you've already paid". Fast forward a week and an additional charge appears on my credit card for 28% of the original rental costs for the additional driver.

When we've challenged the cost, despite not being made aware of the additional cost, it was included on the rental agreement and therefore Europcar are unwilling to refund. Why would these costs not be mentioned to us when we specifically asked their representative what the costs were? To add salt to the wound, the additional driver was just for an emergency, they didn't even drive the vehicle.

                <div class='text'>Europcar’s handling of vehicle reservations through the Motability scheme, specifically with Direct Line Motability. Eight days ago, a reservation was made on my behalf by the Direct Line Motability team, but I am still without a vehicle. Despite this ongoing delay, it is frustrating to see that Europcar has vehicles available online for casual customers, allowing them to book and pick up cars at very short notice.

This raises serious concerns about Europcar’s commitment to Motability customers. It seems that Europcar is accepting reservations through the Motability team without actually having the vehicle stock available, while prioritizing casual customers who book online. This is not only unacceptable but reflects poorly on the company’s ability to serve those who rely on such schemes for their independence and mobility, particularly drivers with disabilities.

The lack of communication and transparency around vehicle availability, especially after waiting for more than a week, has caused significant inconvenience and stress. As a disabled veteran, reliable transportation is crucial for my day-to-day life, and this experience has greatly impacted my ability to manage my commitments.

I strongly urge Europcar to address this issue, both in how they manage stock for Motability reservations and in how they prioritize these customers. It is unacceptable for vehicles to be available to casual customers while Motability customers are left waiting indefinitely.

Booked with them thinking they were a reputable company as my wife was travelling alone with our 4 kids, so I wanted a no-hassle experience for them....well how wrong was I! Their agents at the airport counter were extremely rude, pushy and disingenuous with my wife, and she ended up paying £500 for comprehensive insurance which she didnt want, the car they gave us had a worse NCAP safety rating than the car advertised, which i understand to an extent they cant guarantee what car you get, but we made a simple request, she was staying nearby and the rental was for 26 days during low season, so presumably the advertised car would come back into availability during that period, could they give us a call so we could pop in and swap the cars, well it was as if I was asking them to sacrifice their only child, no one would give a straight answer, lots of ummming and arrring, lying to us about not knowing when cars would come back. Left the kiosk asking them to call us when they know more, not only did they not call us it took 3 days for their customer services team to even acknowledge our email, saying they couldnt look into our complaint until the rental period was over!! What a load of garbage... Seriously, save your money, or go to Hertz, Sixt or Avis....</div>

                <div class='text'>The worst experience I have ever had and it just goes on and on.
I got a speeding ticket during my rental period. It happens. Europcar wrote to ask for £40 administration fee. That is fine. They were prevented from drawing it by Amex fraud team. That happens too. I spoke to the fraud team and cleared the blockage. Meanwhile Europcar fines division wrote to me and asked me to pay on line since they could not get payment through the credit card. I paid promptly. Europcar car also pulled payment despite my email receipt that I had paid. They also tried to pull from another card which I refused (Revolut) this meant that that card was cancelled causing me more inconvenience.
I then found that two divisions of Europcar have £ 40 each one France ( the collections website they sent me to fill in ) and uk one who pulled the money. Both payments showing on my credit card.
Meanwhile yet another division is demanding money because the fine has not been paid!
I have shown proof of payment multiply to each of three email addresses used by Europcar.
The last straw is now someone has decided with zero evidence that there was a second fine for parking in addition to the speeding one.
I despair. This is supposed to be a simple administrative fee. I suspect it is institutionalised fraud which is intended to wear me out The response from Europcar is worse than useless. The link just takes me back to another bureaucratic never ending maze of robotic questions. You guys have endless information already from me. The rental reference is 156862411
The invoice reference is D130218441
The case reference with one of your teams is 21410697
I expect you at Europcar to reach out directly to me</div>

                <div class='text'>Giving the Worthing branch a 1 star is too much. We were regular customers but no more. The customer service is terrible, apart from when Pat is on, she is amazing. They constantly change the time of your pick up (which is always hours after you need it), change the size of your van without informing you first which then costs more in fuel, over charge you on the mileage due to a staff member taking the mileage down wrong oh and giving you a van with no water in the coolant so you end up breaking down on the M23 with your young child! Oh and the latest, the branch manager cancelling your order at 4pm on a Friday because I said the customer service I had received was disgusting so I was accused of being abussive (that being the reason the branch manager cancelled it) even though Pat (staff member) did not think I had been oh and then after Pat spoke to the branch manager she changed her mind saying she didn’t mean abussive but still cancelled my booking!
Don’t worry though you didn’t ruin my weekend, I was able to get another van elsewhere who offered exceptional service.

I have already reached out to their customer service team with x2 complaints about our local branch and the response I had back from them was as follows:
‘Having reviewed this matter, I would like to sincerely apologise that you were dissatisfied with the service provided to you. Upon investigating with the branch, we would not be in a position to provide any compensation.’
They clearly do not understand at all, It’s not about compensation, it’s about the customer service we received and the fact their branch manager told me I was being ‘abussive’ in what comes across as a reason for her to justify cancelling my booking and then retracted that statement to her staff member (Pat) so clearly she admitted that statement she accused me of was not true but yet they think that is acceptable. WOW</div>

                <div class='text'>We recently had an incredibly frustrating experience with Europcar, and I cannot express enough how disappointing their service has been. We booked a vehicle online for an important event – our Charity Awards – and provided all the necessary personal details. They had no issue taking our money and conducting an online check. However, after travelling for miles to collect the vehicle, we were told that our investigative journalist could not take the van because he wasn't on the electoral roll.

Why on earth would they allow us to proceed with the booking, travel such a long distance, only to turn us away upon arrival? It wasted an entire day, time we didn’t have to spare, all for nothing. Now, we’re left waiting for a refund that has taken days to process, with no van, no solution, and a serious disruption to our event plans.

My biggest regret was not checking the reviews on here first! Had I seen the experiences others have had, we would never have booked with Europcar in the first place. Thankfully, a local company stepped in last minute to save the day, but the way Europcar handled this situation was absolutely shocking. The lack of communication and care is beyond frustrating. I strongly urge anyone considering renting from Europcar to think again. Don’t waste your time, energy, or money – their service is abysmal!

And Europcar, don’t come at us with the generic response of “we’ll look into this for you” – whatever you are doing is a scam, if not of people's money, their valuable time!</div>

                <div class='text'>Europcar acted as the supplier for a car booked through a 3rd party. They refused the car for reasons not explicit in the terms and conditions I was issued by the agent.
However Europcar are absolving themselves of any blame and say that I shouldn't book through 3rd parties like Enjoy Travel or Holidaycars.com, as they look for loopholes to withhold refunds.
The irony is that Europcar are happy to act as business partners to these 3rd parties !! ( and play no part in regulating them)
Needless to say I am still trying to get a refund.
Book through one of the other main hire companies (maybe try Sixt, Budget, AVIS etc), but not Europcar,and certainly not an agent like Holidaycars.com or Enjoy Travel.</div>

                <div class='text'>...in reply to those who have paid in advance for a car only to be refused at the desk following the now mandatory online check I understand your frustration. I paid £3000 online only to be told at the desk I would not be getting a car. I then had to wait days for the refund in addition to having to pay another £3000 to Avis who saved the day. I would not recommend Europcar to anyone!!!! Europcar had no hesitations at all about leaving me stranded at the airport as they had no way of knowing I had the financial means to find another £3000 immediately.</div>

                <div class='text'>I booked a car from Europcar Bristol Airport online on 12.04, as I needed a car short-term while sorting out transport. The full amount for the car was paid prior.
There were no concerns, until they did an address check. I have been at the address since August 2023, and it is on my UK license which I presented. Following a check I was told they could not rent the car following address check.
Although it still makes little sense, it would've been fine if they did this before I paid the £350 online, and traveling all the way from Wales per bus to get the car.</div>

                <div class='text'>Note: Europcar is writing fake five-star reviews to offset all of the negative reviews it is receiving.

My experience...

Save yourself the time and stress: take the rental you plan to give to Europcar, set aside around £20, douse the rest in gasoline, and set it alight. Use the £20 for public transport instead.

I was foolish enough to rent a vehicle from them. I now realise this is not a reputable company but rather a rolling scam—a front for financial abuse masked as fair policy. Whatever you pay in advance, regardless of the booking mediator you use, rest assured, it won’t be the final price. The car you want won’t be available, the cover you obtain through a booking mediator will be ignored, and you’ll be charged for additional coverage (even if you insist you’re already covered).

Effectively, here’s what will happen: you’ll arrive to collect the car you booked. Europcar won’t have it. They’ll offer you a shed on wheels and claim it’s similar to what you reserved. It won’t be. They will then offer an upgrade at an exorbitant rate, trapping you because you need a car to make your holiday work. Then, they’ll place a temporary hold on your card, and for weeks after returning the car, they’ll bombard you with invoices for additional costs at inflated prices.

Europcar is about as transparent as sandblasted glass covered in treacle.</div>

                <div class='text'>We reserved a car at Edinburgh airport a couple of weeks ago. On arrival we were told by the rental agent that the car reservation had been made on a non-UK website and therefore we had no CDW cover. He quoted £29/day to have cover added. Subsequently, I checked the reservation and found it had been made on Expedia.co.uk, and standard CDW cover was included.</div>

                <div class='text'>I have hired cars and vans from Europcar many times before and the last one was only 3-4 months ago . I again made a booking with them and received an email to upload my passport ,driving licence and take a selfie to complete check-in online . And shortly after that received another e mail as my checking completed and documents have been validated. When I went to office in Glasgow Lancefield Quay a gentleman call Sam asked my address details and asked my driving licence then said ohhh we did a soft credit search and we are not able to hire you a car . And then he advised me to speak customer service to explain situation and then I called them and the person I spoke on the phone diverted my call to a manager - I then find out he is the manager for their airport branch and he spoke to me on the phone and then he spoke to his colleague on the desk and speaker was on and I was able to hear . Once he started to be rude then his colleague put the speaker off !! Then I left the place with big disappointment as never had this before anywhere !!! So be careful before booking a car with them as they can confirm your booking online but once you arrive their office then they can say sorry we can't hire you a car !!! Doesn't matter you come from abroad and have important meetings, important events ,plans etc !!! All they care to cheat !!! I would never ever go with that company again !!! That's scam !!!</div>

                <div class='text'>There wasn’t ever any resolution to my complaint only extensive brush offs.
Needless to say I will never use Europcar again and will happily share what was easily the worst customer service experience and blatant scam I have ever experienced.
2nd update, exactly the same correspondence from Europcar batting off the problem with no resolution whatsoever. This has been the most diabolical customer service I have ever received by a long way. Word from the wise avoid Europcar or face getting blatantly ripped off.
**Update: I patiently wait for your response, you suggested I email customer services which I have twice so far with no reply, add that to the 40 emails I have sent to your customer services already trying to. sort out the excessive fees and poor customer service**
Absolutely appalling from start to finish. Terrible customer service with only a premium line to call costing me a large additional sum. Incorrect car provided with additional costs amounting to well over £400. I complained directly with diabolical correspondence from them in return and no resolution. I will never use them again and strongly advise the same. Only giving one star as negatives not possible.</div>

                <div class='text'>One of the worst, rubbish and disgusting company.
I have booked a luton van and tried to pay online, on call and not possible. Later discovered not available anymore. Then, tried to hire a van and spending a hour on thr phone with a useless girl and suddenly she hanging off the phone. Tried to call later to found out if was booked but not.
Then tried to book it over the phone with someone else and same problem could not pay, because of their rubbish system.
Told to try again online, but same, theirs rubbish system didn't work, even talking with my bank which confirms my approval of transactions in few occasions, but Europcar system "stinks ".
Second day call again to check the confirmation but again useless employee Tanya, who couldn't find my booking, and weird asking for my private number plate to check the booking. She pretending do not find it even provide, name, address, email...nothing to be found by useless Tanya.
Annoyed, I hang off and called again after 30 minutes, and surprisingly a mate find it in 1 minute but SURPRISINGLY the price was different and higher . From £118 to £180, and my quote was not founded anymore and even allowed to upload.

                <div class='text'>Europcar has got to be the WORSE company for booking ANY rental vehicle staffed by useless morons.

I booked online for a vehicle, received email confirmation of booking, then received ANOTHER email confirmation the vehicle was ready for collection. The very next morning just before I was leaving to collect the car I get a phone call from a complete and utter moron who say they have no vehicles for a whole week and would I like to rebook for the following week. I said no, because I had made arrangements with my team to travel in the booked vehicle and now we were going to have to cancel our journey. "Sorry sir, no vehicles goodbye" was the response.

3 days later I'm STILL waiting for a refund - bunch of cretins!</div>

Her manner was awful. then I was dealt with kindly by an employee only to be informed that the van was not ready. I have been waiting for 25 minutes( rental time paid for) but still no van.

                <div class='text'>BOOKED through Europcar Manchester, a Vauxhall CORSA CAR 5 MONTHS IN ADVANCE.
Arrived after a long flight to be told the vehicle booked wasn't available. The only alternative was a choice between 2 Mercedes at a cost of 925 GBP extra( for 5 weeks) to what had been contracted. Very pushy staff
Unfortunately I was in a position where I was due in North Wales 2 hours after pick up so wasn't in a position to check elsewhere.
The car was returned with no damage and a full tank 5 weeks later.
On my return home I received a demand for 925 GBP after I had already paid in full.
It has taken over 2 weeks of emails to have the error in my account rectified.
Worst service I have ever received at a car hire agency and begs the question are these tactics regularly employed by Europcar.</div>

                <div class='text'>I’ve had a great relationship with Nottingham, Europcar for over two years, renting most months from a week to three weeks depending on my needs. A new Manager started a month or so back, and whole atmosphere has changed, refusing to extend when I’d never had issues before, grudgingly giving me a higher category car when they were short vehicles ( like he was doing me a favour) and today, TWO days after returning a car to Heathrow - and less than a month after finishing a three week rental with his branch, got rejected by ID /credit checks. Did NOTHING to solve the issue despite there being no issue 6 days ago. Could have resolved it if wanted to as staff do on a daily basis ( calling head office could have been one step) Now have to wait 3-14 days for refund. Went to SIXT at the station and 15 mins later was driving a rental from there. It’s called Customer Service. Cancelled my booking in two weeks and will NEVER book a car thru them again whilst this manager is in place. Too much ego and drama.</div>

                <div class='text'>Despite paying all upfront and confirming the reservation… when I get to the desk they stated a ‘standard eligibility check’ was required. This is despite turning up with driving license, passport, proof of address, DVLA check code showing no points or convictions, and a credit card with required deposit limit.
Putting my details into their system, the result was “unverified”. Multiple employees stated “we do not know what that means” but that there was “nothing they can do about it”. Without so much as an apology, I was told they couldn’t give me a car, it wasn’t their problem and they couldn’t resolve it. To top it off - no refund! Since I booked via a third party, the refund has to be claimed through them (and that has a minimum 20 working day resolution but that’s another issue…).

So there I was, with no car, no refund and no compensation. Trip had to (obviously) be changed at my expense & travel back to my house had to be purchased (since the plan was to drive back in the hire car!).

No explanation yet received, though emails sent to an address provided to a team “that can maybe see the issue”.

All in all, an expensive and depressing waste of time.
My recommendation is to find a different hire company!</div>

                <div class='text'>Be very careful of this company! They delivered a car to me were hours late, but the driver was sitting around the corner waiting for his lift home before delivering the car, was only worried about himself rather than someone with a baby. They marked the documents no damage and I inspected the vehicle and there was damage. They are now trying to charge me for a cracked windscreen, but this was cracked on delivery and I have pictures with the time and date. They obviously employ unprofessional drivers, as he would have seen the windscreen had damage unless he was driving with his eyes shut!
I have put a call out a call for a Manager to ring me- let’s see what happens. If you have vehicle KP24FOF - beware there is damage to this vehicle that the company are trying to hide !!</div>

                <div class='text'>I was told on the day before hire, and too late to make alternative arrangements, that I would have to take a long wheelbase van having ordered and arranged for a short wheelbase version.
This meant that I was unable to use secure parking as the vehicle was too big and had to park on the roadside overnight and the van was then broken in to leaving me with the repair bill the root cause of which was the change in category of the van provided.
I would suggest that if any last minute category swaps are imposed by the hire company then insist on a full damage waiver as you lose control of managing this risk yourself through their actions.</div>

                <div class='text'>Hi, I would have given an even lower rating if I could have but clearly they don't care as is evident from the already low 2.2 rating.
These guys are crooks. I wrote to even their CEO Alain Favey and that also didn't change things. For a GBP 200 rental, they charged me GBP 360 for basic CDW which was already part of the economy rentals booking. Give a handwritten page to sign and then can add whatever they want later. Then they claim that I agreed to something that is impossible to agree for any person with a basic working mind. Have written to everyone. Amyris, customer support and Irene LeMaistre | Europcar Mobility Group in UK | Business Services | Executive Relations Officer, They are all the same. Cheated me in broad daylight. The money doesn't hurt that much as does the feeling of being cheated. Will stay away and advise as many people as I can to stay away as far as possible from this company. At least green motion and others are cheaper. They are neither cheap not honest.</div>

This morning I was informed that they cannot offer me a van for that day because they do not have any vans available and they can offer the Van on another date. As a result, my booking was cancelled and now I have to wait for a refund from 3rd to 28th. I paid for the Van straight away! The main question is: Why do you put false information on the website and not inform customers that the Van or car for a specific day and location is available when it is not?

Hired a van for day so my daughter could move some bits. Returned it at 1730 but the employees were busy. Offered for me to leave keys but I asked them to look at van first. My mistake not getting paperwork there and then.Allok and left vehicle with them. to get email later next day that a dent was on van 5cm to 15cm long, van was booked in 18hrs after I returned it. My anxieties raised and I couldn't sleep. Went down to see damage which was a mark no more than 1cm long and I hadn't done. Eurocar was going to ask colleague who accepted vehicle on return and would phone me. They did not phone me.Went home and looked at my video I took on taking vehicle out and found exact same mark. Returned again to show Eurocar car video and they agreed and informed me that they would note no claim to head office. This has not been done and even though I made a complaint two weeks ago, apology and resolution has not been forthcoming.
Eurocar exaggerated the damage which I was not responsible for to scam me out of has much money has they could. Avoid with extreme caution. Never going there again or would ever recommend. Luckily I took a video prior to hiring van

                <div class='text'>Recently, Audi hired a Europcar vehicle for me while my car was being repaired. It was delivered to my house as they didn’t have a car available for a few hours. On delivery I was shown the damage to the car including windscreen damage and it was noted on the rental form. I was told to return the car with the fuel the same as on delivery. As I was going to Manchester the next day I went to a petrol station to check it was full. I put 9 litres in which I presume was tie fuel used by their driver to go to Woking from Heathrow where the depot is. When I returned the car to Guildford Audi I filled the car with fuel, so I returned it with more fuel in than when I got it. They didn’t pick it up from Audi for 3 days. Later on I got a charge on my credit card for refuelling of £16. When I questioned this, they said I had to pay for the fuel their driver used to go back to the depot!! Unbelievable. How do I know where he went? Why should I pay for their fuel? Any way as well as this they are now claiming that I damaged the windscreen. They say it was unreported but it is on the delivery paperwork
This is the MOST DISHONEST car rental company ever.
I will never rent from them again.

                <div class='text'>Please beware! Paid £1,400 for a £580 Europcar Rental: Misleading Deposits and Hidden Insurance Costs

I initially booked a 2-week rental for what seemed like a great price—£237 in total. The pick-up process went smoothly, and I was asked to pay a “deposit,” which I was told would be refunded if the car was returned intact. However, at no point did the staff mention any additional costs beyond what I had already paid online.

Fast forward to the end of the two weeks—I needed to extend my rental, but it wasn’t possible. No big deal; I returned the car and booked another one for £343. This time, I noticed that they had sneakily added a £30 per day insurance premium. To my shock, this same hidden charge had been applied to my first rental as well, even though it was never communicated to me.

Now, here’s the real kicker: the so-called “deposit” isn’t a deposit at all! They cleverly call it that to make you think you’ll get the full amount back, but in reality, they deduct the insurance charges from it. It’s a deliberate tactic to keep the insurance cost as hidden as possible until it’s too late.

When I asked if I could opt out of the insurance, they refused to give me a car and would not refund the £300+ I had already paid. In the end, what was meant to be a straightforward car rental turned into a financial nightmare. For four weeks of car rental, I spent £580 on the online booking, plus an outrageous £800+ on insurance, bringing the total to nearly £1,400.

It’s clear that Europcar’s strategy is to lure customers with attractive online rates, and then, after you’ve paid the non-refundable fee, hit you with surprise insurance charges—last minute—leaving you with no choice but to accept. If insurance is mandatory, why isn’t it included in the advertised price so that customers can make an informed decision? This is blatant false advertising.

Europcar has lost me as a customer forever, and I strongly advise anyone to steer clear of this company. In all fairness, the cars themselves are clean and good, but their deceptive, scheming practices make for a truly awful experience.</div>

                <div class='text'>I picked up my car from Gatwick airport. I explained to the counter staff my exact requirements particularly that I didn’t want an expensive insurance policy. The young lad was helpful but immediately went off and returned with two Mercedes keys and told me I could have them instead at a discount. I told him that I wanted the car I had ordered but with the basic insurance. In the end that car wasn’t available so I had a free upgrade. So far so good.
I repeated about my basic insurance requirements. He then went through the costs. I told him I didn’t want roadside assistance but he told me that was part of the package. I should have questioned him further on the package but he was nice and helpful so I signed the contract. Later when I read it closely I realised I had paid for premium insurance. I have now complained but have been told I have to wait until the hire has finished before I can complain. I now have the feeling the whole thing is a well rehearsed con to get the client to pay for higher insurance. Reassure the customer you have his best interests, focus on the free upgrade, gloss over questions on insurance and then stick him with premium cover. No doubt I will get no rebate later when I complain again.
Bottom line is to be very suspicious. If you suspect they are trying to cheat you they probably are.</div>

We took the car back 1 day early with no problems at all and have the invoice to prove it and they have taken another 1150 pounds out of my bank on the same day . I have emailed them lots of times and can’t get any help or refund . I cannot believe this has happened and am devastated as the amount is now 3000 pounds for 9 days hire !!!</div>

                <div class='text'>@GLA airport is a team of masters of ripping off additional costs. They do not recognize the terms and conditions of brokers selling their rental services.
We had a voucher from a junk broker (CARFLEXI - avoid them), we were refused a vehicle from a voucher (it's not about car brand but about category of the vehicle), we were told to pay extra for this vehicle and after the refusal, we were issued a vehicle of a lower category.
In addition, we were tricked into selling some absurd additional insurance, even though we refused twice.
When we picking up the car, the seller said it was a deposit, but after returning the vehicle it turned out to be insurance.
If you respect yourself and your money, stay away from them!</div>

                <div class='text'>Easy to rent the car that was nice but accidentally we put the wrong driver on the booking and the helpful guy at the desk told us he canceled the booking and made a new in the right name and we then could get a refund on the previous booking which was for 3 days we just had to call and get the refund our self

But unfortunately that was a lie cause we can’t get a refund after the planned pickup time has come

So now we have paid the double amount

It’s a poorly treat us filling us with a lie sending up paying twice 🙁</div>

                <div class='text'>Arrived at Manchester Airport branch with booking ref. to be told they have no car available. They said head office should have informed me which they didn't and I could speak to customer service regarding the wasted trip and money. Spoke to customer service who said that the branch have told them that the verification had failed and availability wasn't the issue. What a lie!! We didn't even get to licence etc because there was no car. They found one after about an hour but it was due a recall. They wasted my time and money!! Would not want to use this company ever again. Please be aware and don't trust them. You cannot rely on their customer service to use common sense and solve issues.</div>

                <div class='text'>Dropped rental car back and was told to leave keys, there would be no issues as the staff member was cleaning another vehicle. As I was in a rush I stupidly agreed.

Car was left in a busy car park and some time later an email came through claiming damage had been caused to the door.

Despite stating that the vehicle was left in a busy car park with no continuity between handover over and inspection I was billed over £500.

I protested stating that procedure wasn’t followed and this staff member had told me to leave the keys and head on, there was no continuity and zero evidence I caused this damage due to this.

Unfortunately i got very blunt replies stating the claim would be upheld and sometimes staff couldn’t walk round at the time. I requested a phonecall in relation to the matter which never arrived.

Extremely poor customer service and disgraceful that this claim is still being upheld. Will never use this company again and I would advise others not to.</div>

                <div class='text'>Avoid. Avoid. Avoid.

I hope that others read the reviews before booking with Europcar Gatwick. I have rented cars for over 45 years and have NEVER been scammed like this.

On arrival the woman at the desk tried to make me upgrade the car - making it appear that that was the one l been allocated (she already had the key on the desk infront of her). I refused and said l wanted the car l had booked.

Next, premium insurance was added to my contract without asking me. As a result, l paid 150% more on my originally booking price. I have annual excess insurance and never use the rental company insurance went l rent.

They hid the fact that insurance was added by including it in the credit card excess authisation. Therefore, you are unaware that you have purchased insurance until your card is charged after the rental. Look at the reviews, many others have been scammed in this way.

When I asked if the car had any damaged, l was told that it wasn't necessary to check it. On return, it was a different story, with the attendant checking the car minutely - going around it several times. In the end he found a very small scratch and l was required to sign off on the damage. I cannot say if the damage was already done when l rented the car. The scratch was so small l do not believe l would have noticed it ... and certainly not in poor light conditions.

If you use this company you should make sure that you photograph the whole car, including wheels, before you drive off.

Never again!</div>

                <div class='text'>I was mis-sold cover when I collected the car. The Europcar agent told me I had to pay non-optional additional funds to upgrade my vehicle to a larger one since they didn’t have the car I’d pre-booked in their fleet. After chasing this up with several customer service agents, I was told that I’d in fact been charged for additional insurance cover, and they refused to refund me for the cover that I neither wanted, nor used.
On top of that, the car I rented broke down. When I arranged for a mechanic to come check the car, they didn’t show up. I waited for over 5 hours for a mechanic to turn up, sitting outside of my hotel until 1am - only to have nobody show. Then they tried to charge me a call out fee.
After spending months begging multiple customer service agents for assistance, and after repeatedly being palmed off, I’ve now given up on getting my money back.
Beyond disappointed with the outcome, and a rubbish experience from start to finish.</div>

                <div class='text'>My partner needed to hire a car whilst hers was at the garage.
She needed to get me to surgery, whilst transporting our 1 year old.
The car was delivered at 7pm on 31/09/24.
It was not driven till 5am on 01/10/2024.
By the time we got to the hospital, the dash was lit up with warning lights.
Not what you’d expect for a 2024 plate with 4K on the clock.
We called Europart, and we were told to contact the AA.
We have spoken with Europcar on at least 12 occasions, where the lines are charged, and they have taken zero ownership.
Honestly, this is a truly terrible company, and the reviews speak for themselves.
If we hadn’t have made it through to the account manager for our cars manufacturer, I’m not sure we would have got anywhere. Avoid, Avoid, Avoid.</div>

                <div class='text'>i am not aloud to put zero i was forced to choose one star or am unable to write a review . my target is at the head ceo of motability why they would be using a firm to cause so much trauma to disabled people needing there car back . you need to address there needs such as stopping this firm from taking a card number in order to go back after the car is returned to take money for things that are not true such as not cleaning it proper or lack of fuel .These cars are being dropped off to local garages and leaving them for the garage that is repairing the cars to just hand over a envelope and key no one there to look it over with the customer to pick out any damage or scratches the customer might not be responsible for . and worrying disabled and sick people that they might have money took at any time if the company sees or finds fault . also we do not know what exact amount is held in the tank as it allows extra for emergency fuel after using up the tank said amount .so when told to fill the customer will find they have to continue way above the amount needed . Why is the director of this company conncected to Bentley cars when i looked up companys house ? its time motability supplied each paying customer of motability with cars direct from the garage doing there repair . it is also time all people if they have a alergic reaction to something or need a service dog to supply cars to the disabled while there cars are being repaired without this threat hanging over them of having unlawful amounts taken from there accounts . Are motability and all garages including audi aware that under the equality act 2010 they are serving the public they are obliged to make arrangements to accomodate disabled customers . and that service and assistance dogs are used to help and make disabled peoples lifes more bearable in many different ways . and there is no test no colour of harness colour no paperwork or certificate and they should all be catered for and listened to . the system using diabolical companys needs to be ended now .</div>

Would mark as 0 if I could..
Absolutely appalling! Rented a car, paid online, came to collect to find out-the one I have booked is not available! Instead I was offered an “upgrade”-Not!- at an extra charge of the amount I have already paid! So double the cost! Agent would not have an eye contact, unhelpful is an understatement ! So left with no car or money as refund is not as quick as taking the money !!! Absolutely disgusted with the service, or the lack of it! Never ever!

                <div class='text'>I booked a car through AutoEurope who collected full payment, confirmed my reservation and issued a voucher to collect the car from Europcar at Newcastle Airport. I live 16 miles from the airport, so someone gave me a lift to the airport to collect the vehicle (had to also pay the Newcastle Airport drop off charge (£4) to be dropped off in car park near the terminal!
I went to the Europcar desk in the terminal only to find no one there. Instead, there was a notice saying that the desk was closed and that they were operating from a cabin in the car rental car park at the opposite end of the airport!
On arrival at the new Europcar location I was asked for my license which I presented. I also offered to give them my passport and proof of address which they declined (said they didn’t need them)!
After 10 minutes the person behind the desk asked me to confirm my address which I did, and I was then told that Europcar had declined my reservation and that they could not give me the car I had booked and paid for! In fact, they couldn’t give me any vehicle!
When I sought clarification, I was told that their system had not been able to verify my address which by the way is on my licence and I also had additional proof of address with me but this was not acceptable as the “system had declined” my paid for in full confirmed reservation!
I spoke to the manager who said he could do nothing nor could he refund the money I had already paid as it had been collected by AutoEurope and I would have to take it up with them!
He also astounded me with a tale of how Europcar was clamping down on who they hired cars to because some had not been returned and others had been used in robberies etc and as a result of these unacceptable comment and inferences I was left feeling as though I was some sort of undesirable crook!
If that wasn’t bad enough this whole experience caused me a great deal of embarrassment as it was done in front of other customers including the bit about cars used in robberies etc hence the clampdown on who Europcar would hire vehicles to!
I again challenged them and said that I’d been hiring cars for more than 40 years including with Europcar and never had any problems and was then told that I was the 3rd person in a row who the system had rejected, and that the manager was going to raise a query in the company’s group chat to see if other branches were having the same problem. Not that this helped my situation!
Ultimately not only was I was unable to hire vehicle but I was also left stranded at the airport and had to take a taxi from the airport back to South Shields to pick up an alternative hire vehicle from a local car hire company before they shut at 1pm.
This whole experience has proved far from acceptable and its unlikely that I will use AutoEurope again despite having used them many times previously but I certainly will not be using or indeed recommending Europcar again, in fact quite the opposite – I strongly advise anyone thinking of using Europcar to think long and hard about it and certainly don’t assume that you have a confirmed reservation.
Based on my experience, not only will it prove to be a costly exercise, but it’s also an experience you are likely to regret!
If by any chance you are foolish enough to try and book with Europcar than I strongly suggest you put an alternative back up plan in place too, because based on my experience you are more than likely going to need to fall back on it!</div>

                <div class='text'>I want to share my experience of a “blatant scam” by Europcar to help prevent others from falling victim to such frauds.
I rented a car at London Gatwick Airport after booking the car and purchasing a "Premium" insurance policy online with e-Dreams. At the airport counter, the agent informed me that since I already had insurance with full coverage, I did not need to subscribe to any additional insurance. I was also told that a deposit of 700 euros would be charged (something I was already aware of through the contract signed with e-Dreams). In good faith, I signed the required forms on the tablet (the amount indicated was £647, which I believed to be the deposit) and was given a document with the rental and payment details; nothing else was handed to me, nor sent via email (certainly not an insurance policy that might have raised some suspicions).
After two months of waiting for the refund of what I thought was the deposit, I was informed, upon my inquiry, that no refund would be issued as the amount charged corresponded to the cost of the insurance I had supposedly subscribed to. Realizing I had signed a document without verifying that the amount (which was not specified) actually consisted of £100 for the deposit and £546 for the insurance policy (this was the final amount charged), I nonetheless filed a complaint with customer service. Their prompt response (only 21 minutes after my email!) stated that since it was impossible to verify what had been discussed verbally, only the signed document held any validity! It goes without saying that all the information regarding the costs and charges was written in such a small font that one would need not just a pair of glasses but a magnifying glass!</div>

                <div class='text'>When they delivered the car I was happy. The entire time having the hire car went well. The problem is getting this collected. I was told they would be at my home 6pm and would call 15 mins before hand. No call happened no show either.
I called and called.
Then I got a text the following day telling me they would be here in 15 mins.
90mins later then it changed.
They can't come and pick it up.
But an email came to me telling me after it's gone off hire I'm totally responsible for it and I'd be charged.
I had already told them on the day it came off hire that I had a death in the family and they didn't seem to care.
Now it's the weekend it's still here. No idea when they are even coming to collect.
Dealing with the solicitors after my crash was hell as they arranged this and now I have problems getting the car back.
Shame it's a really nice car they provided me after the crash but as for the service getting it back to them is rather dire.
If there is a next time I know I won't be back.</div>

                <div class='text'>I hired a van from the Maidstone site for one day. The staff on site were very helpful.

Unfortunately, the company has subsequently charged me £80 administrative costs for the Dart charge, despite no penalty being levied, and the charge being paid in full (I have documentation from dart.gov to show this).

I tried on numerous occasions to pay the Dart Charge immediately after the crossing, but the van WAS NOT REGISTERED AS HAVING CROSSED. Explanations of this to Europcar have been met with the email equivalent of shrugged shoulders.

I have used Europcar countless times in the past but will never be doing so again.

                <div class='text'>On the 10th of March 2024, I hired a vehicle from Europcar and returned it on the 11th of March 2024 with no issues raised at the time of return. I was surprised to later receive a damage report claiming that I had damaged the vehicle. This report contained my signature, but no damage was brought to my attention when I returned the car, nor was I shown any documentation or proof of the alleged damage at the time.

In an effort to resolve the matter, I sent several emails to your customer service team seeking clarification. However, the only responses I received were automated emails apologizing for the delay and requesting my continued patience during your investigation. Months passed without any meaningful communication.

Two months after the incident, I sent the following email to inquire about the status of the investigation:

-----
Dear Customer Service Team,
I am writing to you again to resolve the following issue. We have not received any communication except for two messages stating:
Dear Customer,
Thank you for your continued patience during our investigation.
Please accept our sincere apologies for the delay in responding to you, due to the nature of your query; it is taking slightly longer than usual. It is our aim to provide you a full and thorough resolution, including any necessary supporting documentation.
We would like to offer you our assurances that once the information we are seeking has been obtained, we will respond to you. In the meantime, thank you for your continued patience in regards to this matter.
We look forward to contacting you again in the near future.
Could you please advise on the status of this issue?
-----

Despite my best efforts, this email went unanswered. Instead, I was contacted by Shakespeare Martineau LLP Clients Account, a debt collection firm, which was both intimidating and unexpected, given that no final resolution had been communicated to me regarding the alleged damage.

In August, I finally received a response from Europcar stating that "a member of our team will review your query and reply accordingly." However, no action followed this, and on June 10th, I received another email stating that you would not be pursuing any third-party providers and would be billing me directly.

As you can see, I have received numerous conflicting and contradictory communications from Europcar throughout this process. This is not only highly unprofessional but also confusing and distressing.

Under the Consumer Rights Act 2015, I am entitled to clear and transparent information regarding any charges or claims made against me, as well as reasonable communication in the resolution of any disputes. Europcar has failed in this regard, breaching your obligation to provide services with reasonable care and skill as required under Section 49 of the Act.

Furthermore, the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 outlines that it is illegal for companies or third parties to engage in intimidating or unfair practices. The involvement of a debt collection firm in this unresolved matter, without following your own procedures, raises concerns about the fairness of this process.

I find it unacceptable that Europcar has escalated this matter to a debt collector instead of adhering to the process stipulated in your terms and conditions. I request that this issue be resolved in accordance with the law and your own procedures.</div>

                <div class='text'>Terrible terrible service.
Whilst waiting in the office, my first clue was someone else being told their hire had been cancelled without any notice to them. That customer was not happy.
My turn, I am told that hire has been declined but could not tell me why.
I am now 30 miles from home with no mode of transport.
I explained that I had followed every instruction from them a week prior to hire, so why am I now being declined whilst stood at the desk. Just got told they couldn’t hire me a vehicle.
I would never use this company ever again after this experience.
Quick enough to take my money at the booking stage but I have to wait up to 28 days for the refund.

Do your checks prior to the hire date to avoid angry customers at the desk!!!

Our first hire was fine everyone very nice. Brand new suv had no damage returned without incident. Our second hire a week later was not so good. We were given a well battered yellow BMW with all damaged listed on the agreement, I double checked with the desk before we left. On return, as is the way we were in a dash to get to the airport. The guy looked at the wheel hub and said that's new damage. I said no look it's listed on the rental agreement right there its old damage, and gave him the agreement. Also told him I'd checked it with the guys it was listed before i took it out. HE DID NOT LOOK AT THE AGREEMENT AND KEPT OUR PAPER RENTAL AGREEMENT (my second mistake). My first being that i didn't think it necessary to take pictures of the damage as it was already listed and checked. He then took photos and put them on the release which he insisted I sign. I asked if he would verify with the pictures from previous hirers so he could see it was not my doing, he mumbled something which I assumed stupidly was a yes. Now two months later I've just received notification I will be required to pay for the damage. I regard this behaviour as down right dishonest and disreputable and will never hire from them again. Good lesson in how to ruin someone's holiday memories. Thanks but never ever again.</div>

                <div class='text'>I had my booking for hiring a van cancelled by Europcar the day after I made an on line booking.

I phoned to ask why and they replied that they had run out of vans. I asked why they took the booking in the 1st place as on-line prices generally go up towards the weekend and their action has prevented me from booking with another company at a reasonable price.

The reply was ‘ company policy’ and I was encouraged to offer feedback which is what I am doing.

No real apology and I would have thought it fundamental for a booking service to have the vans available at time of booking.

                <div class='text'>This is the second time I have had an issue with Europcar in a month. After paying £150 via Autocar to rent a car from Malaga for 3 days, I was then charged a further 150 euros for the 'basic rental' fee by Europcar as well as 50 euro for an airport fee, another charge for the car being electric (even though I didn't book electric), they then said that insurance was 37 Euro a day but didn't mention tax on top and basically it has cost me at least £350 to rent a banged up crap car for 3.5 days which was insane.

BEWARE!!!! BEWARE!!!! You have been warned. Horrible experience with EuropCar UK. I rented a car through Booking.com. When we arrived, they told us they didn’t have the car that we requested/paid for prior and they were going to upgrade us. They upgraded all right. On top of the $700 we already paid through booking.com they charged another $1200. They told me the initial $700 was included in the $1200 so I only had a $500 upcharge. I asked why there was any upcharge since they did not have the car I booked. I was told because I reserved the car through booking .com and not through them it would not be a free upgrade that I could go back to booking.com and request a different car or upgrade to this one at a cost. I am standing at the airport with 4 other people and didn’t have many options at the moment so we elected to pay the difference for the upgrade. Little did I know they charge me $1200 on top of the initial $700 I had already paid. I was not aware of this until AFTER my trip. Now that the car was dropped off they charged me another $400 to replace a tire because there was a minor cut in the side of the tire. This is the same tire that had previous damage noted on the rental contract. Where the cut was and the size of it you could not see it depending how the car is parked. When I returned it the cut was in the 1:00 o’clock position on the tire and easily visible. If the car is parked with the tire between 4:00 – 8:00 o’clock position you can not see the defect. At any rate I was charged $400 to replace the tire that only had about 60% remaining tread left on the tire. All in all it was a horrible experience with them and I will never use them again.

Response from Customer Service
Thank you for contacting Europcar Customer Services.

I can confirm the rental station will offer additional optional products to our customers upon their arrival at the desk, to ensure they are aware of all the products and services available. It is then the customer’s decision to accept or decline the products offered to them.

Whilst I appreciate you have stated that the upgrade charge was not agreed to, I would be unable to comment further as I was not part of the verbal discussion. When the two parties involved are providing conflicting information, I can only base my decision by the documented evidence available.

As the rental agreement and Additional Optional Products form have been signed, in acceptance of the product, the request for the charge to be refunded has been respectfully declined.

Regards,
Omar Amoifek</div>

                <div class='text'>We hired a car for a weekend break, Thursday to Sunday. On Friday the car shows a mechanical fault to the suspension. The car was removed and not replaced despite over 40 telephone calls to Europcar. We were staying at a rural location and all plans for the few days had to be cancelled. No compensation was offered whatsoever. An incredibly poor and shameful service.</div>

                <div class='text'>Terrible customer service on the phone. I’ve placed multiple bookings weeks in advance, had the booking confirmed a few days later to say the vehicle is available, then recieved a cancellation confirmation out of the blue a couple of days before the booking! Leaving me completely in the dark and without the van I had planned for. Awful company that have caused me nothing but stress.</div>

                <div class='text'>If I could give no stars I would. I upgraded at Palma airport as we had an extra person on our holiday. I had paid £780 with Rentalcars (who I have never had a problem with before). My new bill was £1,800!! It wasn’t until after our holiday that I realised that was ON TOP of the original price! Their customer service basically said it’s my fault because I signed the contract (which was in Spanish!) I will never use them again and I would implore everyone to give them a wide berth. I will no doubt get an automated reply to this review like all the others about how sad they are at my disappointment. Don’t bother. 🤬🤬🤬</div>

                <div class='text'>Terrible.
You get handed keys at the desk and are sent off to find the car without a member of staff. After a flight, kids in tow etc etc, we took a video of the car upon collection just to show the current condition. Upon returning the car we also took a video and then dropped the keys in the box (again no staff to take the car back or inspect it). A week later im then charged for fuel, baring in mind the car had more miles of fuel than when i collected it. Then weeks later im sent an invoice for damages which you can clearly see were there on the video when we collected the car. This video proof is not good enough, they want JPEG photos and are still proceeding to charge my card £280- even though I have proven we did not cause the damage. This is morally wrong, it is ridiculous to expect someone to find the car, inspect every inch of it, then go an que back up at the desk to try and get an employee to help with kids hanging off you!
Will never use Europcar again

*****Update*****
have emailed the customer service as advised in the response to my review. No luck......</div>

                <div class='text'>So after booking the car a few weeks prior, I download the app and fill everything in as Europcar says doing this before makes car pick up smoother.

On the day, I'm standing at check out, bank card in hand to pay, waiting on the keys so I can take my son away for a weekend together, our first trip just the two of us.

Then I het told I dont pass the soft credit check and so they cant give me a car. I'm not looking for credit, I'm willing to pay the full rental fee up front. Tough, no car.

Excellent. So now I'm left thinking, I cant let my son down. Quick trip to Arnold Clark, drove out 15 minutes later in a hire car.

When you get everyone hiring a car from yourselves to download your app and give all the information needed to make the car handover smoother, do you no feel that including your stupid credit check should be done then and there before sending all hire documents out as if done and dusted if you're gonna turn people away on the day?

Complete waste of my time, and a horrible start to the day which almost ruined time away with my son.

Will never attempt to use you again and will recommend everyone to stay away and go elsewhere before getting let down on day of hire.

Shocking</div>

                <div class='text'>In brief, it is not a honest car hire company.

Update on 26Sept: after the communication, they admit nothing for sure, as we had signed the agreement. So, just prepare yourselves to pay extra if you want to have the hire.

Long story.

booked via rentalcars.com, another low rating company, an automatic was booked.

When I was at the counter, the staff told it was not under my name, and the car was not automatic, unless pay extra for it to amend it to be under my name and automatic.

rentalcars.com confirmed the booking was under my name and it was booked as automatic.

Also, it was funny that the counter staff told me not to trust rentalcars.com, and rentalcars.com CS told me not to trust any staff from rental companies.

The counter staff handed me a form of accepting extra insurance and additional drive (who helped me to pay and drove me there) or else no car would be given.

At that moment, I had no choice as I needed a car for my journey.</div>

                <div class='text'>My husband, who is renting a van for work, got a flat tyre on the motorway and called Europcar for help because they don't provide a spare tyre. He called around 5:20pm and got an already ridiculous estimated time of arrival for breakdown service for 8:30pm. He then got an updated time of arrival of 9:00pm! They then still didn't arrive until after 9pm when my Husband had been waiting on the hard shoulder for 4 hours!! Disgraceful service, dangerous and lazy. And to top it all off my Husband has said the employee that came to recover him was very rude! Shocking customer service and will never use the service again. - Also forgot to mention this is the second time this has happened and the first time he waited nearly as long for help. Unreliable vehicle and poor customer service.
Update - contacted the following morning (today) enquiring about repair after they gave him no information whatsoever. Quoting repair time between "18:39 and 20:30"!! This means he has no transport to work today and is also still expected to pay for the days van hire even though the van in unusable. Disgraceful.</div>

                <div class='text'>Booked a car online to pickup from Belfast international airport and was quoted around £45 only for them to sneak in a ‘premium location surcharge’ when you sign the rental agreement which TRIPLED the price I was expecting to pay.

                <div class='text'>I booked a hire car using the Kayak website. My money was taken, but I didn’t receive a confirmation email so I decided to call and check.

- the hire company, Routes, had no online presence, but I noticed their address was the same as Europcar

- I called Europcar. They had received my booking, but said they weren’t sure a car was actually available because I had booked at short notice. They asked me to call back on a different number.

- I called the second number and explained again what had happened. The customer rep said he would contact the branch and put me on hold. After 20mins I received a recorded message that no one was available to speak to me and was cut off.

- I called again and was put through to the branch. They said they had a car but it would actually cost more than double what I had paid. I said that was too much and wanted to cancel. They told me for a refund I would have to go back to Kayak.

- I spoke to Kayak. They said they didn’t have my money. I needed to contact Expedia who were the intermediary on my booking.

- I contacted Expedia. They said I had to get a refund from Europcar.

I’ve now spent four hours trying to sort this mess out, have been charged but have no car.

It’s amazing to see the pyramid of companies all determined to take their share of money from the public, but without taking any responsibility for actually delivering the service.

In the end I contacted my local branch of Enteprise who have helped me out at a reasonable price. Who knows if I will ever get my money back from Europcar/Kayak/Expedia/Routes or whomever else took their share along the way.</div>

                <div class='text'>I should have checked the rating before I before booked with them!
Their client service is absolutely appalling; the correspondence you receive after booking a car borders on threatening; they require you to download their app after making an online booking (presumably just harvesting more information on you to sell on); they do not reply to emails, nor messages on their website.
It's like flying with a low budget airline!

                <div class='text'>I used priceline to secure a car rental through europcar. Due to airline delays we were unable to pick up the car until the next day
When we went up to the europcar rental desk at Manchester airport and explained the situation, they said the rental had been canceled. I had prepaid the rental through priceline, it was non-refundable. I had several appointments to keep and needed a car. I was unable to contact priceline about the situation. I ended up renting from europcar, because the other rental places didn't have a vehicle available. I think that europcar car were completely outline and they should have honored the reservation
Good customer service always brings customer back
I will not use europcar again. I recommend all other travelers to be aware of their sly, possibly underhanded business practices
I will be contacting priceline upon return to the US.
Europcar uk, responded to the above review of their service by giving me am email address. If they were really interested in helping. They would have looked up my name in their records. The email address is generic and does not give me a person to contact. Probably generated using AI</div>

                <div class='text'>I purchase car hire through Eurocars because they were a large well know company. Eurocars sold us out to Routes cars Vancouver because apparently Eurocars don't trade in Canada. We weren't told this when we booked. They also advice you to visit the Eurocars desk in Vancouver airport (its doesn't exist) we had to wait 30 minutes for a shuttle to collect us and drive 20 minutes to the routes rental collection and another 20 minutes sorting out the car as they tried to tell me I had to pay extra for another driven even though I had included this at booking.
They also took $500 deposit, again not mentioned when booking! We had been travelling for almost 24hours with 2 kids so NOT ideal!!
We had problems with our car after finding out a temp repair had been done on a tyre previously and it should have never been given to us as it was unsafe. Routes hung up on me several times. refused to take responsibility for the repair cost so we could get back to Vancouver. Routes stated it was a Brand new car and it was our fault (the car had done 12000km! and I had a statement along with phots from the garage) I reach out to Eurocars for help and was told to contact the routes branch. So we had to foot the bill!!</div>

                <div class='text'>Awful experience!!!!
Booked my car hire well ahead of my holiday. My flight was delayed last night so I called europcar to explain I was unable to collect the car whilst at the airport waiting for my flight that was delayed by 3 hours as the Glasgow office would be closed on my arrival and I would have to collect Saturday morning. Agent said they would send an email to confirm my call. Glasgow Europcar had my flight number and phone number. I stayed in a hotel that was a 3 minute walk to Europcar and when I arrived at 9.30am I was told they had given it away the their 1st customer of the day as they put me down as a no show. Agent was rude not apologetic and told me I would need to pay £400 extra for a premium car!! When I explained that I called their call center he told me to call them again as there was nothing they could do as they had already cancelled my booking without Informing me. I called the call center for them to say as I could not collect at 10pm the car was released and a refund given, I was not told this when I called from the airport waiting for my delayed 3 hour flight. Left me at Glasgow airport with no form of transportation for me to get to Inverness. Worst customer service I have experienced in a long
time!! If you can't get to your booked car due to no fault of your own and you have taken to steps protect your booking by calling the call center be prepared for your car to be cancelled and not to be informed until you go and collect.
I will be putting in a formal complaint as I have not received my refund yet and I have had to find and extra £600 for a car from another company
No holiday treats for me or my family!!</div>

                <div class='text'>Absolutely terrible company. I would advise anyone to look elsewhere
I prepaid for a car online, and I was paying the full Insurance. But when I went to pick the car up they did a soft credit check and it failed! So what, I've paid in full, and the full insurance. So even if I was of the mind to steal it the insurance was paid!
This has left me without transport to pick my brother up from Bristol Airport, and it's to late to find an alternative.
This must be the worst experience I have had with any company.</div>

Staff on the phone don't know what has happened either.

                <div class='text'>If you want to get fu**ed over then you should definitely rent from them, this is the second time im renting with them and it was awful from the car to the service, and on top of that they didn't not release my security deposit has not been realised and it looks like it never will be, so yeah if you are looking for classic scamers and ready to lose all your money over a cheap pice of car then you should definitely get scammed by them</div>

                <div class='text'>We rented a car in the UK a week or so ago, they took a chunky deposit reserved on the car, which is normal. The car and service was great, we returned it on time, but 8 days later the amount is still blocked on our card. I have bills to pay, and can't as these shysters still have my money. Apparently they are very sorry, but that's not really cutting it, Seriously, avoid.

EDIT, I've been speaking to customer service who just told me it was Europcar policy to hold onto the deposit for up to 10 working days. I've never had this from any of the other companies I have ever rented from, and I can't afford to leva 1000 euros with you for close to 2 weeks. For that reason, and that reason alone I won't use you again.</div>

                <div class='text'>I recently rented a car to travel in while in Spain. This was done through the UK portal.

On returning the car, they subsequently raised bills for missing items that weren’t there on collection and damage that was already present.

Even though evidence has been supplied in video and pictures, they still took money without my consent during the dispute.

This has now left me no choice but to take the matter to a small claims court. As the agreement was made in the uk it falls within UK law, something the advisor seems to think is wrong.

A terrible company. Please look at any other rental company than these,

See you in court EUROPCAR.</div>

                <div class='text'>Europcar is the worst car rental company, I would recommend to stay far away and I should have come and looked at the reviews before I booked.

I booked a vehicle and paid before hand only to be rejected during the pick up, I was then told I was going to be fully refunded only for a few day later finding out I wasn’t fully refund and was withheld £45 that I’m still waiting to get back and it’s already been 10 working days.

I would stay far away from this company very unprofessional and can’t keep to their word.</div>

                <div class='text'>When I checked my credit card for my last rental in Heathrow, I found two unreported charges by Europcar:
1. a 193.36 GBP charge on, which should not be
2. The charge for the insurance for 8 days was 575.34 GBP when the car was returned after 7 days, and we were promised that it would be adjusted.
I send a reply to Europcar 4 weeks ago, they never answered . They do not care.</div>

                <div class='text'>Booked a car from the stevenage depot to be picked up on 26th August (bank holiday monday). Had email confirmation that the car would be ready. Turned up at the agreed time and the depot was closed. Spent a few hours on the phone to customer services. Got cut off 4 times. the out of hours number I was given went straight to voicemail and I was not called back when I left a message. Customer services kept telling me I needed to go Luton if I wanted a car but they wouldnt sort a car out for me. I had to drive there to arrange it if I wanted one which wasnt possible. I had to cancel my business trip because of this.

A week later I was then charged a no show fee of £102!!

I have now got all my money back including the no show fee but the company did not care at all. No apology, no offer of any compensation. Nothing.
Really appalling customer service.

I will never use them again.</div>

                <div class='text'>Booked a Holiday Package with TUI, and the 'free car' package was with Europcar. As the car was not sutible for size of party had to pay over £200 extra to upgrade..not free then. Collected car at Faro and after signing contract went to visit car, it took several minutes to record damage. I returned the car with no extra damage and full tank of fuel. Several days later my card was charged with a vehicle recovery plus charge which apparently was above the normal service offered. This was not mentioned and I did not request. So scammed 68 Euros.Why not explain and I would not have accepted, just a way of getting extra money.</div>

                <div class='text'>Simply the worst company I’ve ever dealt with!

Rented through Ryanair and they placed with EUROPCAR. At the rental desk in Majorca they were pleasant enough. However there was no opportunity to view the car prior to signing paper work. Paperwork stated no damage however there was multiple dings, dents and scratches.

I took photos of these as proof of damage.

Low and behold the classic invoice for €240 euros arrives for a small dent on bumper that was there prior. I’ve shared photos, proof of paperwork which contradicts those photos and disputed the damage which I still maintain was no my doing.

After asking the process for mediation they ignored my email and invoiced my card anyway.

At this point I can’t help feel it’s their business model to offer cheap rental and then claw back fake damage claims on the back end.

Don’t rent a car through this company, or at least if you do expect to be billed for something at the end.</div>

                <div class='text'>Rented a car online. Picked it up at Edinburgh airport. The young man at the pick-up desk was polite. He offered full insurance, but I refused because I had insurance from the bank that issued my card. However, he insisted on buying Road Assistance Express. I agreed. It cost me 104,76 pounds( 9,17 per/day). Three hours later, on a very narrow road, we hit a rock with the left front wheel. The tire was punctured and flat. Of course, there was no spare wheel - a big hello to Mercedes-Benz with its B200! I called 0800 0280999, which was listed where I was looking for a spare wheel. It turned out this was impossible from my US phone! As it turned out later, the company's website listed a different number for non-UK phones - 0116 247 3228. However, this number was not listed in the agreement or anywhere in the car. This is simply outrageous! In the end, I got through. Explained the situation. It took almost a one hour(!) - endless waits on hold, interruptions, stupid offers to rate their work.... finally I was told that help was on its way. This was around 4:00 PM 17 September. NO ONE CAME OR EVEN CALLED before sunset at 7:20PM! I had to find a mobile tire repair shop and resolve the issues for 230 pounds. I am writing this the next day at noon. No one has called yet. This is a real EXPRESS service from EuropCar</div>

                <div class='text'>Booked car hire with added extra for a sunday collection at 11. Went to shop - it doesn’t open on a Sunday…
Called customer service asked to change the collection to Belfast airport to be told would have to cancel the booking and rebook - losing over £300 to wait on a refund. Advised I can not do this to be told he doesn’t own Eurocar doesn’t care either way and hung up on.
Called back got a girl this time at a party - could hardly hear her over the music to be told the same as it’s a new booking. Asked if we could just get it on Monday morning to be advised no as it’s a new booking would again need to loose and wait in the original booking money and rebook.
Cancelled completely and went with Alamo - who were a dream against this riot.
16 days (working) later - still waiting on my refund !

                <div class='text'>Thank you for contacting Europcar Customer Services regarding reservation 1179912958.

When you arrived at the branch, 250.00 GBP was held on your account as a deposit for the rental. This was only recorded as pending on your account and not as a completed transaction. When the vehicle was returned, the full amount was reversed and was not converted into a transaction. The above amount would then be released back into your available balance. The number of days this would take is a banking process, not a Europcar one,and this takes around 3-10 working days to show on the account (up to 28 days for international transactions).

If your statement lists pending amounts separately, then the deposit amount should disappear from this list. Some online statements can show authorisations as debits, so again this should drop off and your available balance would increase. In either instance, you would not see a refund or credit in your list of transactions, as the deposit was not debited by us.

I would like to offer my sincere apologies if this was not clearly advised previously and I thank you for bringing this to our attention.

If you require any further information regarding the deposit process, you can check our FAQ section on our website - >click here.

I trust this information assists with your query.

                <div class='text'>Overcharged us with €210 at pickup for border crossing twice(!) and made us signed without showing these costs or sending an agreement. Saying these are refundable fees. They were not and couldn’t get a refund after very long discussion, saying we signed it. Absolute scam.
I used to trust Europcar but since they together with Goldcar it is one of those cheap companies who lure you in and overcharge you for nothing.
I will NEVER use them again and you should also avoid. Cheap? It will add up and nothing you can do about it.

Incredibly unhappy with the customer service when trying to raise a complaint - we have had no responses to the escalation of the complaint - ignoring this escalation twice. Very disappointed. Do not use</div>

                <div class='text'>A few days after returning my rental car without any damages & full of petrol (agreement number: 156837779), I realised that they didn't refund the entire deposit of £752.38 that I left on the counter at the Edinburgh Airport.
So I reached out to the customer service asking why they didn't do it and there were still £68.22 pending to be refunded. After waiting 1 week they replied saying that there was a mistake and they charged me "1 additional day of hire plus licenses and fees due to an error", so they refunded £15.82 for the overcharge. At that moment I was still confused why they haven't refunded the rest of the money, so I had to follow-up 2 times with them because they were not saying anything about the rest £52.38 pending to be refunded.
Then finally they confirm that those 52 pounds are related to an upgraded added at the counter and that at the time of the pickup, there was added a "Roadside Assistance Express."

At this moment I also realize that the agent basically did this intentionally because I didn't buy the full coverage insurance at the counter. I told the agent that I had my own private insurance and he stated that the private insurances from booking.com don't cover glass and wheels. I told him that it was an insurance with my bank and that it has full coverage, so it seems like in that moment he decided to add the Roadside Assistance Express and didn't me anything that this was an upgrade and that I had to pay £52.38 extra for it.
If he would have done that, obviously I would have say no because I have full private coverage insurance already for this.

What did the agent do? He just told me to sign the Rental agreement in multiple corners of the paper on both sides and that's it. And then told me to put my credit card for the deposit. He also didn't mention the value of the total deposit and didn't say that he was charging me £700 for the non-insurance deposit and £52.38 for the Roadside Assistance Express. At that moment I would have also asked by there were 2 payments and I would have cancel it.

This is a very old school mislead sales tactic that should be claimed, but the customer service hasn't helped me further because I signed the agreement. The agent also signed the paper, but he didn't put his name, so I'm still waiting for a response from customer service to know the name of the agent who did this and file an official claim. What a terrible and disappointing experience.</div>

                <div class='text'>Hired a car from Europacar Heathrow and dropped off at Gatwick all went well (although it was very expensive) the people there checked the vehicle said all good and we left, about 2=weeks later we get an email with a scratch about 4 cm on the very front of the top of the bonnet, we told them we did not do it and it must have been done in the yard after we dropped it off but to no avail, they charged us 379 pounds which converted to about 765 Australian dollars which was extortion for the photos that they sent to us.
DO NOT hire from this company as the reviews you are reading are constantly the same and very true.</div>

                <div class='text'>Worse company I have ever used. Car didn't turn up at 11am. They left a message saying the deposit payment hadn't gone through at 9am and to call this telephone number (they took the main payment okay) 4 hours later after trying to get through, as the King's X depot wouldn't answer their phones to me. Called customers services they tried calling Kings X and they didn't pick up to them either, then they pretty much told me there was nothing else they could do. Finally after speaking with CS for the umpteenth time they emailed them to call me. Later finally got a call and they said they were busy. No apology, missed time slot by 5hours for a business trip. Wouldn't use them ever again. This is a slimed down version of events. Really really poor company!

Oh and managers don't speak on the phone when you ask for one. It's below their pay grade!</div>

                <div class='text'>We clearly said we didn't want any additional insurance, which the guy at the counter confirmed and then prepared the papers/contract. It was super busy that day and we were rushed a bit, so we just signed the paper without reading it thorougly anymore, as we verbally agreed on the terms and already read through the terms etc. online when we did the booking (where we already booked some insurance which is why we didn't need an additional one).
Turns out they booked an additional 65£ in the end for an insurance we never wanted in first place.. thanks for nothing and not a nice way sneeking additional costs in like that.</div>

                <div class='text'>Rented a car in Italy and paid for it at checkout. A month later, got a duplicate charge for the rental and contacted customer service. They mentioned that there was an error in the system which resulted in a duplicate charge for which they were trying to resolve. After a month of chasing, I finally got a refund but it was short by ~USD30. Raised a follow-up and was told that I needed to raise a new complaint. Raised a new complaint and after another month, was told that they have checked and everything was in order without explaining why they didn't repay me the full amount they accidentally charged.

Bottomline: This company may charge your card double and have you chasing for months to get your money partially back. Avoid at all cost.

Also, when you book a guaranteed model, what they really mean is you'll get a much shittier version of the car and a talking to at the counter of what "guaranteed model" means (spoiler alert: nothing)</div>

                <div class='text'>I recently had a europcar provided car rented for me by Audi as they had to keep my car in the workshop.
The fuel economy of the Mercedes CLA was great but when it was dropped off at my house on 29th August, it had been driven from their Heathrow depot, so they had used some fuel. As I was about to drive to Manchester and back, I went to Sainsbury's and filled it up. It took 6 litres. All in all - as tracked by Google Maps - I had driven 445 miles in the car by the time I dropped it at Guildford Audi on Friday 6th September (8Days).I filled the car again at Sainsbury's. I have the receipts. Europcar charged be for 466 miles and an excess fuel charge of £13.39 for 6 litres. This is exactly the same amount I had to put in on delivery.
So Europcar are charging me for their delivery costs not for my use. I will never ever hire a car from Europcar again. They are rip-off merchants</div>

Having received no refund over a week later, I am told that I need a booking reference to get my money back.

Because it was the end of the day I called Europcar too to check that they'd have my vehicle (a van)ready to collect first thing from their Bermondsay branch... yes they said, that's no problem and their system allowed me to book and of course take my money. Next morning I get a taxi and go there at 8.00am and they have no van and very little apology. I ask if another nearby branch might have a van and they say maybe, why don't you go and see. I ask if they could call ahead for me and they said no. I desperately needed the van as am clearing my deceased parent's house and this absolutely ruined all the complicated plans I had. And of course they still have my money which may take 30 days to refund!! Rude and unreliable, avoid avoid avoid.</div>

On picking up the advisor handing me the keys said there was no need for him to come out and check vehicle with me. I was told i "could" take a video of the car next day and send it to them.

I was assuming they had at least done a check earlier cos the fuel tank was 6/8 full. I drove the car and returned it 2 hours earlier than planned at 4pm and returned it with the petrol at 6/8

In the contract I signed that if there were no issues,mi deposit of £250 would be returned in 10 working days, which meant on the 30th of August 2024 it would reflect on mi account.

Today is the 8th of September making it 15 working days and I still haven't received mi money back!
They charged me for fuel that was not in the vehicle and are trying everything to keep or cut as much out of mi money.

If I don't receive mi full deposit by tomorrow, I'm taking this further and they'll need to compensate me for breaching their own contracts and policy.

UPDATE 10th September 2024:
I have sent more info through their link, called twice and today makes it 17 working days yet mi deposit was to be returned within 10 days!

This company should be shut down period! I can not imagine the tourists coming into this country and having to deal with this kind of broad daylight thievery!</div>

                <div class='text'>Booked online and got confirmation for car, planned all the trip and Europcar surprised by informing there is no car available until 4 pm... They informed its online and they cannot do anything and its out of their hand... other rentals had live tracking of their car and informed that they are fully booked... Europcar should also have live tracking and stop taking fake booking.</div>

                <div class='text'>Myself and my partner booked a van online for the weekend. My partner has an international license, and is a citizen of the UK. Prior to our booking, my partner spoke to the customer services team on numerous occasions to ensure that the license would be accepted. Each time, we were told that we would have no problem, and the licence would be accepted. To our surprise, upon collection, the license was not accepted and we therefore were unable to hire the van. The lady who assisted us was very understanding and polite and offered a refund. The lack of communication within the company is an absolute disgrace. The customer service agents require some serious training on rules and regulations. I WOULD NOT recommend hiring from them.</div>

                <div class='text'>I hired a Fiat 500 at Glasgow Airport. All was fine until a flat tyre on a remote Scottish lane. I looked in the boot. No spare! Europcar remove the spare tyre service kit that Fiat equip the car with and leave an 0800 number to call. This is fine if it's not raining, you are not miles from anywhere and if there is mobile coverage!! I had to walk 2 miles to get reception. I then had 4 hours to wait until a recovery vehicle arrived. The recovery firm had to wait until the next day to go to the nearest Kwickfit. We had to take a bus 2 hours to get to Oban to pick up the car the next day. The fault with the tyre was a leaky valve but because it had to be driven to clear the road it had to be replaced. Total bill from Europcar was £395!
So we lost a day with the car, fortunately, it was possible to extend our stay in our bnb for an extra day.
All this because Europcar removes an essential item to ask for an extortionate charge to insure against a puncture!</div>

                <div class='text'>RENTERS BEWARE!!!!!!
Rented a car from Edinburgh airport, dropped off at Glasgow airport. They are refusing to hand back the deposit saying that a parcel shelf is missing. It was NEVER there to begin with and we didn't even know it was meant to have one.There is a hidden compartment in the boot where the parcel shelf is meant to be stored if not in use. It is an unknown car to us being foreigners and we are not to know that this car was meant to have a parcel shelf.

Before renting...TAKE PHOTOS OF EVERYTHING!!!!! INSIDE AND OUT, EVERY PANEL, WHEEL AND INTERIOR. They will try and sting you for anything they can and are not interested in talking with the original hire place to resolve the issue. Tried to say we scuffed a wheel, luckily we had photos as proof that it was marked already. Marked us down as "refused to sign" before even giving us a chance to ring the original hire destination to try and work it out.

Would not deal with Europcar again and I'm hoping Thrifty car rental in Dublin is a lot better to deal with.</div>

                <div class='text'>Be aware that not all collision damage protection policies are the same for all rental car companies! With Avis or Budget, CDW/LDW coverage means that the total cost of any damage to the car is waived — zero liability! But not with Europcar . . . their "Medium Protection Plan" just reduces liability to a maximum of £250, as I discovered when I returned a rental with a scuff to the alloy wheel. Yes that is in the fine print but it was not made clear when I picked up the car — in fact the agent encouraged me to take the additional tyre & glass protection to reduce liability — and when I returned the car the agent implied I would be covered. Subsequently, I got a letter from Europcar stating that I was financially liable for up to £250, after paying over £70 in protection coverage for a 2-day rental. Safe to say, I will avoid this company for any future rentals in favor of companies like Avis where waiver means waiver.</div>

                <div class='text'>I hired a car from Europcar (Volvo XC60) on a recent trip to Nice. I booked the rental through a 3rd party comparison site and paid a deposit for the rental and was covered for some extras, such as environmental surcharge. On arrival at the rental centre we were in a queue for about an hour and when we got to the desk was greeted by a very pushy rep. The cost of the rental was not as per the original agreement and they had added on the additional environmental charge. The salesperson also tried to "upsell" me a Mercedes and additional insurance, which I declined, at which point his demeanor became more aggressive. I was also miss-sold a full tank of fuel on the understanding that I would only be charged for fuel I used. They also charged me over £400 for a tiny scratch on the bottom of the rear bumper which I must have missed on the initial inspection, however I do have insurance cover for this. Their business model is clearly to misrepresent the original displayed price and then aggressively sell or even miss-sell add-ons and I strongly suspect their staff are targeted and compensated based on these sales. I will never be renting from Europcar again and would urge others to think twice before using their services.</div>

                <div class='text'>I would not rate this company at all and give it 0 stars. I was hit by a tourist driving a hire car from Europcar last week. Their insurance company contacted me to offer repairs and a hire car from Europcar. I accepted and was given two confirmations of delivery of a hire car today. It didn’t appear! I phoned customer services who weren’t really much help. They told me I’d have to contact Edinburgh branch at Salamander Street to ask when I’d get the car. However they didn’t answer the phone and I was redirected to customer service again who weren’t able to tell me when or if I would get a car. So now I’m without transport and am having to spend valuable time and money chasing them up to no avail. I definitely would not pay this company for the hire of a car as they are clearly unreliable, promising cars they can’t or font deliver. Steer clear!!!</div>

                <div class='text'>I took out the full tank option after being told the fuel would be charged @ 10p per litre lower than the national average. The mercedes I hired had a tank size of 43L. The full tank option was £77. This equates to £1.79 per litre for unleaded...I could fill the car up for £1.41 at the BP station next door to the Poole Europcar centre.

I phone up customer service to confirm if the car was returned with a full tank, the the full tank option would be refunded. I filled up the car on the day of return (39L with the tank still 1/4 full). The BP petrol station is right next door to Europcar.

When I got the invoice, I was still charged £77 for the full tank option and now customer service claims the car was 'NOT' full when I returned it and will not give me a refund.

The full tank option was sold to me based on false price promise. They are now lying about the amount of fuel in the car and won't confirm how much was in the car when I returned it.

                <div class='text'>1. I was charged for premium insurance as about 300 GBP even I asked not to… as I have my insurance…so was said at the desk the total price includes the deposit(not true), dishonest action of the guy at the Luton airport desk.

2. The car was not so clean even outside when I received it.

3. The tank wasn’t full when, only as about 80% of it when I received it, was asked for full tank when return

4. Tried to reach the Luton branch with no one answering at all for many times, even through your cs that tried to transfer me to them, not speaking when the battery died at the first day and the Europecar app direct me to the branch in any assistant, nobody answer…

Nobody at the cs answered my emails till now(2 months) and I confirmed that I sent to the right address.

                <div class='text'>There were three europcar issues.
The first one was when they tripled their prices in the time I was waiting for them to call me back after they cancelled a booking- I complained about that but that's just what they do. They don't guarantee it wont change so isn't really anything we can do.

Those phone calls were also charging my phone bill without me knowing, but again, apparently that's in the small print somewhere so they wont do anything about that either- although I have sent an email. It incurred £18.47.

Lastly, the fine for the scratched alloy. Essentially, when I returned the car, I parked it in the drop off bay, then headed in assuming we would do the check out report with the europcar person as it was within drop off hours, but the queue was HUGE, literally out the door into the street. I had work, so didn't get a chance to check out the car. They then sent me the email saying they found a small scratch to the alloy, that isn't covered, even though I got the highest insurance cover I was eligible for. I emailed to say that I didn't damage the car and if they had enough staff then we would have done the check out together, but they basically said that's not their problem and I will still be charged for the damage- despite escalating it.

                <div class='text'>I was regular. But not anymore.
This company app is not working! The website is corrupt, and it can trick you out of your available funds. AVOID!

Today, I logged in to the website and verified my debit card as usual. The website spits an error and charges me instead of creating a booking on their system. The charge is now in my pending transaction, preventing me from using the money.

I phoned customer service, who explained that the money wouldn't leave my bank account since there was no booking. However, I cannot use this money for five days, and I need a car on Monday with no money to pay for it.

This company will run a credit check on your name at the time of the booking and may leave you stuck for 5 to 10 days with no cash and no way out!!!

Customer service cannot do anything without a manager to supervise them! Complete sham!

Edit: after the reply.

Your reply is detached and automatic as can be. I stipulated that I contacted customer service 4 times on the day and wasn't able to resolve.

"Why don't you write us an email?"-is not good enough. If you had motivation, you could investigate based on my information and your CS logs/recordings. There is nothing more to add.</div>

Check the car thoroughly before accepting it. Their employees cannot be trusted to list all existing defects and you may be found liable for them later.
Do not believe the person handing you the keys when they say that there is only, for example, one item of minor damage on the rental agreement. I recently collected a car, was told that there was only one item of damage: a chip on the windscreen. When I checked over the car before leaving, I saw that there were scuff marks on the wheels but assumed that as it had not been mentioned this constituted usual wear & tear. The car hire rep was dealing with another customer. I am not a mechanic, nor an employee of a car hire company, to know what constitutes acceptable wear & tear or unacceptable damage. I accepted that he could do his job. A few days later I returned the car in the evening after the office had closed so did not see a car hire rep. 2 days later I was very surprised to receive an email stating that there were 5 items of 'new' damage. One of these was chipped paint on the edge of a door, something that would have been hard to see. The car hire rep had opened all the doors and taken detailed careful photographs. What a pity the same care had not been taken when the car was prepared for hire. I was lucky that my photographs showed all the ‘new’ items of damage to be pre-existing. The car hire company puts the onus on the customer to inspect the car (in detail). Their T&Cs state that “if you don’t notify us of pre-existing defect or damage to the vehicle then we will assume that you have accepted the vehicle in the condition set out in the rental agreement…” It is a shame that they cannot employ people who will professionally carry out their duties and ensure that cars are in a good condition and defects are accurately reported. The people in customer services are equally unhelpful; their attitude seems to be ‘tough, you agreed to the T&Cs’. The ineptitude of the people who check the cars and the ‘hard luck’ attitude of the customer services reflect the bad name that some car hire companies have.</div>

                <div class='text'>Worst experience hiring a car in 30 years.

1) Despite having a large empty airconditioned office, they made everyone including small children wait outside in the sweltering heat. Totally unnecessary (especially as every other rental car company was based in side the comfortable arrival terminal).

2) As you waited for your ticket to come up as, you could see 50% of staff chatting to each other vs serving customers adding significant waiting time [which obviously would not have happened if people were allowed to be inside]

2) Despite me saying clearly that I didn’t want excess insurance cover, I received a hard sell and was effectively threatened when I didn’t take and was asked for an additional €500 deposit.

3) Having paid for a car for four suitcases, the car boot was not close to large enough to fit (and they were soft squeezable suitcases) and I was made to pay more for a larger car (€25 per day)

4) On return, there were no spaces and I parked in the second row of Europcar spaces. I returned the key and was told “it was my job to move it” (by one of the four people standing around doing nothing)

5) The car on filling up had a diesel cap but two stickers said unleaded petrol. I therefore was not able to fill as didn’t want to take the risk</div>

                <div class='text'>Diabolical company!
We hired an suv with them in august 2024 in Majorca Spain and they gave us a “compact suv” which was apparently in the same “class” as a regular suv meaning our luggage didn’t fit and we were in huge discomfort with bags on our kids laps etc.
The queueing was horrendous and the customer service was dire, with no apology at all for our extensive wait with two small children in tow.
The car seats we had to pick up separately from a different location and one of them was broken, resulting in another trip to swap it for another.
They gave the hard sell on the ridiculously costly insurance which was not appreciated and they were unfriendly and unkind.
The return process was awful with lazy slow people not moving cars out the way/parking them so we were stuck in a queue for an age waiting for the morons to move.

                <div class='text'>I had the same experience. Got told by Europcar I needed different insurance despite already paying for one via 3rd party booking company. After being told I had to have it, later got charged for 2 different ones by Europcar that I didn’t agreed to. Stupidly didn’t read the terms on the contract I signed when I picked the car up at Europcar as I had the kids with me but also wasn’t looking out for it as I had already paid for everything up front. Wasn’t told to look at insurance details. Europcar then sent me an invoice that cost me an extra £144 at the end of the term and after disputing that with Europcar was told I had no case. I’d advise using another company, saying no to the add ons and checking everything on the contract.</div>

                <div class='text'>Picked up a car at Gatwick, great service! I ended up with an MG. No reflection on Eurocar but l will never drive one ever again. I went into Derby branch complaining about a miss fire under light acceleration. Response, they all do that and its the only car we have issues with. Sorry cannot help. Try Nottingham, same response, it's only a 1 litre, what do you expect? What l expect is a rental car that does not misfire. Is that too much to expect? Plus we have no cars available dispute a jammed car park. Avoid the MG at all costs. 21-day rental and it will remain parked until l return to Gatwick. Gatwick good, MG BAD.</div>

                <div class='text'>Insurance charge added and I was told it was a holding deposit.

When collecting the vehicle at the Europcar office, I was asked if I would like to purchase an upgrade to insurance, which I declined and stated I already had Car Hire Insurance.

I was asked to supply a credit card so they could hold a deposit and sign a
rental agreement. When reading the document I noticed additional costs and I questioned it. The customer service representative said not to worry as this was the amount I had already paid and the deposit amount (over £600). I was told that if any damage was found on the vehicle after it was returned or I had not refuelled the car the deposit would be used.

After returning the vehicle, my card was charged the additional amount. When I complained, I was told that this charge was for insurance and because I had signed the document, they refused to refund me for the insurance.

                <div class='text'>If I could give no stars I would. Disgusting company. Wrongfully charged for damages, I had to contact europcar myself to find out why there was money taken out of my account. 10 weeks after money was taken they finally admitted it was their error, advised I would receive a refund in 14-21 working days, and it is now the 21st working day and no refund. Called customer service and I have been told to wait until next Monday and if I don’t receive anything then to call back. Absolutely disgusting. I have been £550 down for the last 10 weeks and there has been no urgency or empathy from the company. Will never use again.</div>

                <div class='text'>Awful.
Arrived at Belfast International Airport to be told by Europcar it will cost another £107 to cross a free border from Northern Ireland to Ireland.
Other companies at Belfast International charge £20-25.
Europcar have absolutely no justification for charging 4 times more.
Don't use Europcar, use one of the other companies (like Budget). The staff at Budget have always been amazing! They even stayed open late so I could get my car once.
The response from Europcar has been appalling goes some way in explaining their 2.3/5 rating on Trust pilot.</div>

                <div class='text'>Huge issues with my rental from this company. Poor communication from start to finish. After I handed the car back at an attended check in, I was right there for about 20 minutes because I had to wait for a lift and everything seemed fine. 2 weeks later they sent a bogus damage charge out of the blue. Cue a 3 month long back and forth with them where I was consistently ignored, both the content of my emails and europcar would deliberately wait 2 weeks at a time to respond, presumably in the hopes I’d just give up and pay. They reached a final decision while still having not responded to me pointing out breaches in their terms and conditions so I took it to the ombudsman who reached a decision in my favour in only 2 days - in my opinion, proving that they are *able* to respond and had been choosing not to respond to me. I also had an issue that other people have had where someone verbally confirmed something but this information then just vanished into the ether when I tried to bring them up on it - fortunately this was a phone call so was recorded by the company. I will personally not use this company again and would suggest to anyone who does that you take every possible measure to protect yourself and just assume that the company will take advantage anywhere you leave them a chance to. I’d like to be able to add something positive but honestly even from the start it wasn’t a positive experience. There were more small incidents that didn’t warrant a complaint from me, such as a (male) check in attendant who didn’t understand why I (female) wouldn’t give out my personal details on the phone when I was in public on a train; the fact that I’d booked for a Vauxhall corsa type car and they gave me an MG SUV type vehicle when I’ve never driven anything that big before and the same man told me I’d probably find it easier because it’s automatic… in my opinion, just not a customer led experience or company attitude unfortunately</div>

                <div class='text'>Please be very careful with this company, if you didn’t select the extra insurance then please don’t accept an upgrade. What should have been an upgrade of £5 per day for an automatic cost me more than an extra £500 for a 2 week rental. Blatant scamming their management couldn’t care less about.
One day we might find ourselves in an mis-sold PPI situation with car rental companies, karma!

                <div class='text'>Do not rent from this company. They will conveniently neglect to inform you about London's congestion pricing scheme and then send you insane bills after the fact with fines for nonpayment, (90 GBP!) plus penalties and their own exorbitant fees (40 GBP per incident!). When you question why they made no mention of this ahead of time when they know full well that you are a foreign national driving in the area, why they made no effort to help you prepay or advise on how to pay, and why their cars are not registered for autopay to ensure their clients are protected from daily fines, they will tell you dismissively, "...it is not Europcar’s responsibility to make you aware of the London Congestion Zone or its charges."

By comparison, other companies routinely take care to go over the entire scheme in detail at the rental counter and then they offer you a means of prepaying to guarantee you will be not be subject to fines and fees.

Europcar would rather sweep it under the rug, hang their clients out to dry and then charge you crazy fees.

UPDATE: After being contacted by Europcar and invited to take the matter up with Customer Service, they did absolutely nothing except waste more of my time and send me another denial filled with corporate speak, back peddling, refusing to take any responsibility, pointing to fine print, blaming the client and other insulting lip service.</div>

                <div class='text'>I strongly urge people to insist on being given a copy of their car rental agreement upon collection. I wasn't given one and of course, a dispute arises, with 450 pounds deducted from my credit card I had to leave with them. This was 2 days after I had returned the car and was given a clear "Statement of Return". I had reinterated upon collection that I had no further need of any insurance but miraculously my signature appeared on their rental agreement.This was a very expensive lesson for me and I still think it is a very sneaky way to do business. I would not recommend this company(Gatwick Airport) and urge any future car rentals to be aware, photograph the car before leaving, and insist on a copy of the rental agreement.

                <div class='text'>We had 2 hire cars included in a holiday booking but when we arrived changed that to 1 larger car. The branch then offered us free full insurance for the larger car as a trade off.

When we returned we were then charged over 400 pound for the insurance we were told was free. When I queried this, I was told it was my word against the branch and therefore they couldn't refund it as I had signed. The document was all in Portuguese and therefore I wouldn't have been able to read it to understand. I was also then told there was no appeal process. Saves them the cost of a car for a week but changing to 1 even though we had paid initially for 2. Wasn't refunded the cost of the second car but instead conned out of a further 400 pound.

                <div class='text'>Worst experience ever! Firstly they cancelled delivery of my car hire 45 mins before it was due to be delivered. I had to drive and collect another car. The car was due to be collected on Friday and at 9.05pm on Friday I get told it will not be collected via text - no communication over the weekend. I have contacted the branch today (Tuesday) and it should be collected today, again no communication, no apology. Shocking customer service when you go through. I wouldn’t recommend this company</div>

                <div class='text'>I was supposed to get a car in Luton Airport.
My parents were coming over for few days so I decided to rent a car.
The guy on desk just said "please have a sit, we will do a soft check before to handle the car to you".
At the end they have said to me I couldn't have the car because I didn't pass the check on DVLA. That's ridiculous. I have been left without vehicle and all my plans broke off. Why don't you do these check when booking online instead to let people off just 5 minutes before to collect the car??? And the most ridiculous thing is that they didn't give me any explanation. I have driving licence since 16 years, never had an offence, never had a penalty. That's crazy! and after more than 2 weeks I have not seen not even a penny of reimbursement in my bank account.
Stay far from Europcar!</div>

                <div class='text'>We were provided a car via our dealership due to a fault on our own car. we have had ongoing issues with this car and therefore have a lot of recent experience with hire cars from other companies. our experience with Europcar was awful.
First, we were delivered a car without functioning aircon, it took multiple attempts to contact europcar to notify them of the issue. We were passed between the AA, tyre repairs and general customer service instead of being passed to the depot directly despite using the contact number on our reservation paperwork. Once we did get through, they asked us why we hadn't taken it to Halfords to be fixed as if this is something we should have known to do with a car that is not ours?! We should not be responsible for the maintenance on a car that is not ours!

when the car was dropped off, we had no paperwork detailing the level of fueling we had received but we made sure all 8 bars of the gauge were full before it was collected. we have been charged for refueling costs. we were also not warned when they would be collecting the car despite being told on the phone that we would receive a message letting us know they were on the way, we could easily have been out or in a meeting.

overall terrible customer service and communication, we would never hire with Europcar again out of choice.

edit to add: weeks after this hire we received notification that we were going to be charged the insurance excess because the car required cleaning. no way to discuss this over the phone. no idea how this company still operates.</div>

                <div class='text'>I booked a van to go from Birmingham to Edinburgh Leith, with a drop-off time of 11pm on a Saturday.

Europcar signed everything off, gave me a fixed "guaranteed" price of ~£350 for a one-way trip, and all details were correct.

I arrive in Edinburgh at 2pm on the Saturday, and go to return the van early. I find out that Edinburgh Leith closes at 12 on a Saturday and is closed through Sunday. After phoning Europcar Leith, and then Europcar (main centre), I get to Edinburgh Airport who advise me that I should just hold onto the van and pay the extra 2 days worth of renting so I can return it on the Monday.

I advise them that I am happy to drop it off at Edinburgh Airport as they are the ones who are forcing me to either pay extra for an extended rental agreement that was not originally agreed to when I paid. Edinburgh Airport say that they're happy to take the van and that I would not be charged anything for this.

I receive the "van is perfect, you'll get your full deposit back" form back from Europcar, and then find a couple days later that they are holding onto my deposit and that I owe an additional £600 for a "one-way surcharge". This "one-way surcharge" was not in the price guarantee, and has not been communicated to me.

I have been spending the past 3 weeks trying to resolve this, and have had 2 "cases" opened by Europcar to investigate this, but none have been closed or have given me any inkling into what actions will be done, despite being told I will hear back within 10 business days.

The company is an absolute scam, branches do not communicate to each other, and every representative is willing to blatantly lie so that they do not need to speak with you further.

UPDATE: It took emailing every board member at Europcar to be escalated to the "Executive Complaints" teams, who supposedly looked at my case and acknowledged I was overcharged and removed the note on my credit report and all outstanding charges - and that was it. At the time, I was trying to apply for a mortgage and Europcar made this unbelievably stressful as I had a "defaulted" account on my credit report. Do not use. I cannot reiterate this enough.</div>
