                <div class='text'>Hands down the worse customer service experience I have ever had, lack of humanity and care. I used my digital card to make a booking online, not knowing i needed to present a physical card in branch, I’ve been told I can’t get a refund as the package is non refundable, it was a honest mistake and should be looked at as such. Complete scam. Avoid Europcar if you want better customer care please go elsewhere!</div>

                <div class='text'>I had a great rental experience with Europcar last week and it was all because of Tami at the Heathrow pick up desk on the N Perimeter Rd at Heathrow. Efficient, polite and helpful all through the pick up process he's a credit to the company. The car was clean, in great condition and drop off was super efficient a couple of days later. Very good experience. Thank you!</div>

                <div class='text'>Europcar took 3 payments out of wife's bank account twice for identical sums of money. She is still waiting for a refund and being fed a load of lies from Europcar even with them having accepted liability for the error and told her that the money was released 2 weeks ago. Its now a month since it happened. On top of this, the car has been returned and their pre authorisations have not been released and the deposit has not been returned.
Their continued moving of timelines and this behavior has to be illegal as I do not understand how they can simply take money out of a bank account when the customer has not authorised it. Tesco can't do that with shopping.</div>

                <div class='text'>The booking.com website led me to Keddy by Europcar at Valencia airport in July with the promise of "no queues" but I had to wait more than 30 minutes to collect on arrival. I reserved a "T-Roc or similar" and tried to pre-empt me not getting "or similar" by contacting Europcar (Madrid) in advance. They responded with a "we cannot promise anything" and indeed when I arrived was given a Hyundai Tucson covered in scratches with a flogged engine 65k on the clock. Europcar then pre-authorised 800 Euros on my credit card in case of collision even though I had paid an extra 70 pounds to booking.com for full additional insurance (excess insurance). I hated the Hyundai Tucson. The safety features were infuriating with the parking brake auto-hold not having a light on the console and the locked patrol cap. The staff were very polite at Europcar Valencia airport but the experience was a let-down. One week after returning the car I noticed a further charge from Europcar on my credit card. When I contacted them they said it was an "environmental contribution" charged to me in error when it should have been charged to the intermediary (i.e. booking.com). Long story short I would avoid using either Europcar or booking.com for a car rental in the future.</div>

                <div class='text'>Avoid

I rented a car for a month in June 2025. The collection was smooth although, while the car had been washed, it had not been wiped dry and so was covered with water marks. I inspected the car reasonably thoroughly and could not see any damage.

On returning the car the member of staff immediately identified what she claimed was damage but to my mind was a mark on the rear bumper that was hardly visible and not possible to see without wiping away the water marks. Nevertheless, the staff member required me to sign the Statement of Return acknowledging the damage. She told me that is it was the only way I would get my deposit back and also implied that the damage would be assessed by an expert and would probably not be an issue. As I was in a hurry to catch my flight I signed document.</div>

                <div class='text'>Unbelievable experience with this awful company and the partner companies I have had to deal with.
Booked a Citroen C3 fuel car for 12 days in Tolouse in late July. (almost £300 total) . I used the GOTrentalcars website to book the car from Europcar.

My Ryanair flight was late so I got to the Europcar at 12.30am. They did not have the Citroen C3. They insisted I had booked an electric car of the lowest category. ( Major Red Flag) I insisted I hadn't because I deliberately excluded electric cars when booking. The electric car they wanted to give me could only drive for 1 hour before needing charging. I would never have willingly booked this.

They only had 1 fuel car to offer me but it was going to cost an extra £60 PER DAY!!! I was absolutely stuck, I had a young child with me and it was 1am on a saturday night, I had to drive for 1.5 hours to get to our accomodation. I was forced to get the fuel car at £60 extra per day but they said I could try and explain the next day and change it. All day Sunday and Monday was ruined because I was trying to sort out the situation on the phone and eventually just had to go back to return the car and try to get refunded for the 10 days. But they still have not refunded me. ( RED FLAG - staff directly lied to me)
However the Europcar staff at Toulouse airport were completely UNHELPFUL and RUDE. RED FLAG. I had an argument with them in the Toulouse airport. I parked the car near their returns office and went away for an hour.

When I came back to return the car, they said there was a dimple on the rear door. RED FLAG! I KNOW that I hadn't ever touched this door or seen the dimple when I checked the car over. I think they did it out of malice for my complaining. I asked to check cctv but there wasnt any. They forced me to sign a thing saying I had created the dimple. I definitely did not. It is so small that I took a close-up photo and you still can't see it. They have taken £800 out of my bank account. They have not even refunded me 10 days' worth of £ that I had paid.

Every staff member that I spoke to from GOTrental cars and Europcar says I signed the contract in the first place for the car. I keep saying I was FORCED to sign it because I was stuck in the middle of the night with a child and they did not have the car I had booked. I am being totally GASLIT by these theiving, tricking, fraudulent blatant liars, and they now owe me £1200 plus 2 days of my holiday plus petrol and toll money to return the wrong car.

THEY WILL NOT GET AWAY WITH THIS.</div>

                <div class='text'>After using this company for car rentals quite often over a few years, I thought I'd grown to trust them as one of the better car rental companies that weren't out to scam you at every possible opportunity.

Unfortunately, I was proven wrong when I was handed a cleaning fee for having some dirt, from a shoe, in the footwell of the car. This was deemed excessive and upon querying the matter, I was told this would require 'expert third party cleaners ' and 'the cleaning of a interior specialist'.

Direct quotes, yet evidence of this was never produced and I was ignored for over a month before receiving a dismissive email saying they will not be replying any more.

If only photos were allowed on this platform to show how little dirt was apparently deemed to be excessive. I have since moved to using other car rental companies, as this lack of customer service for a long-standing customer, or anyone, is just not good enough.

I will be reporting them to the British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association for breaching their code of conduct in their handling of this matter.</div>

                <div class='text'>I booked a hire car and paid for it using my Monzo card, got a train to Gatwick Airport and brough this card with me like the booking confirmation said to. I hired another vehicle with Europcar earlier this year and had no problems paying the deposit using this card.

Got to the branch to be told by staff that they don't accept Monzo so I couldn't hire the car. Nobody could explain why this was their policy, only that they had to cancel the booking.

I offered to make a full payment for the deposit amount which could be refunded when I returned the car, but the staff weren't having it either. I spoke to the branch manager, who could only tell me that they didn't accept Monzo and I'd have to cancel my booking.

This policy seems to be based on the understanding that Monzo cards aren't "real debit cards", which doesn't seem to be true.

In the end, I had to ask my friend to travel to the branch with another card, and Europcar refuse to cover the costs of this even though (1) they literally told me to bring the card I used to pay for the booking and (2) their terms say they accept debit cards.

Europcar's customer service have just ignored my attempts to get them to refund me for these costs, or to at least explain their policy. Useless.

If anyone from Europcar reads this, my case number is 23955880.</div>

                <div class='text'>I’m very disappointed with this group
I got a lawyers letter through this morning which I have been asked to pay for damage to the car I hired from the 29/05/2025 to the 02/06/2025.i never got anything back from them regarding this and as far I knew everything was ok.
I since tried to call the lawyers and was on the phone for 1.5 hours to get someone. I gave up on that and called the head office of Europcar to discuss the matter. The woman name was lynne who insisted that they had sent a email for recovery of damage. I then checked my junk mail and found 2 emails from Europcar. One was the invoice from them on the 04/06/2025 saying the car was ok and the deposit would be returned
Which it was by Europcar.

Then on the the 23/06/2025 I have another email regarding the damage to the car ( which was a flat tyre and I picture of the tyre with the nail in it.
3 weeks after the so called nail was in the tyre they contact me to inform me that I must of done it and they were going to charge me for the time it was off the road a new tyre and admin fees of 251.64. Something I did not know about til now.
I know I checked the car out and it did not have a puncture as I checked all aspects at of it with a friend who assisted me in the process. At no point was the car damaged or anything wrong with it.
How can this company say the car was ok and issue an invoice on the 4th June 2025 and then 3 weeks later decide that the car had a puncture and decide to send me a bill.
They must of done this when driving the car round the car park or someone else who hired it and the only person they could blame was the last person who drove it. This is wrong on all levels and I will contest it as it looks like they are blaming anyone they can. Absolute disgrace from Europcar and as a company I used to use regularly I won’t be using again and I will tell anyone who is using this company do not use them as they are not true to there words of being a good company who cares about the drivers.</div>

                <div class='text'>Booking No. 1192827246 – Terrible Experience

If I could rate this company 0 stars, I would. Europcar is a scam company that happily takes money from customers but doesn’t provide the car you booked. They confirmed my reservation and took my payment without doing the necessary checks. I travelled all the way to London City Airport, only to be told I couldn’t collect the car.

This company wastes people’s time and money, and it feels like they take bookings just to hold customers’ money for their own interest. Disgraceful service, no accountability, and a complete scam. Avoid Europcar at all costs.</div>

                <div class='text'>I receive a hire car after an accident. It was a Volvo XC60. I get the car, drive to the supermarket, comeback and the car is dead. Bearing in mind I am due to go on a family holiday in a couple of hours.
I can’t get in touch with Birmingham Newtown branch. I manually manage to open the key fob and the limp the car to the branch who swap it over.
So I have had to return an unsafe car. When it comes to pick up the car after chasing me despite me telling them that it will be returned when my repairs are done they can’t be bothered to pick up the car and I have to wait again for them to pick them up.
I return the car will a full tank and the engineer marks
The paper work to reflect that. I then get just under £20 taken out of my account being told the tank wasn’t full.
I have sent them their own paperwork and have asked for a refund. I spoke to monosyllabic customer service agent who didn’t initially understand the issue. The whole experience has been shocking. Truly truly awful experience. I am now chasing my refund as a point of princible.</div>

                <div class='text'>Crooks!
They told me at the rental desk that I could bring the fuel tank back at any level and they would fill it up at cost price for no extra charge.
2 days after I had returned the car with 7/8 full tank, they charged me £67!!
No responses to emails sent to complain, and unable to do anything on the phone.
DO NOT USE EUROPCAR</div>

                <div class='text'>Daylight Robbery. Had to cancel my booking from Inverness Airport branch as my flight was cancelled . I foolishly hadn't checked every square millimetre of the website to find the 'refundable booking' button when I made the reservation so got charged the full value of the booking (£748.00) which included all the insurance waivers, extra driver even though clearly never used, surprised they didn't charge me for some fuel as well! In the end, we had to hire a car in Huntingdon and drive up to Scotland, and as Europcar had said they would refund me the full amount and didn't have a branch in Huntingdon, we used Enterprise - brilliant service, better car and cost £50 less anyway despite being a one-way hire with unlimited mileage. Will never use Europcar, ever.</div>

                <div class='text'>Scammers, extremely shady outfit.

I picked up my car in Johannesburg and they tried to give me a car without a damage report, telling me “it will be fine”.

Upon checking the car it had clearly been in some form of accident. It took an hour of refusing to take the car without damage report for them to finally say they would bring me a new car at my address later, but that I should take this one for now (I assume they then would have said the car was damaged by in the time between me taking it and them brining the new one).

Travelling with a newborn, this was stressful and they eventually brought me a new car with a damage report and assured me that I had the maximum insurance. Unfortunately this was not the case as I was hit by a driver running a red light and Europcar took £2000 from me.

Be careful, these guys are extremely shady.</div>

                <div class='text'>I've never had a more stressful few days, that ended up costing me an absolute fortune!!
I originally booked yesterday (thur 14/08/25) to have a car delivered to my home address. When I went to review it, the booking was the wrong time and said it would be delivered to my local branch... so I tried to amend it online, but their website is rubbish to navigate through. I called up, and when I finally got through, managed to confirm that I would have the car delivered to my home address and changed the time. The guy said it would be an extra £30 foe the ammendment. Reluctantly, I paid it, asking that it would only be for the extra and not for the full amount, to which he confirmed that was the case.
However, they did take the full amount, PLUS the extra £30, so I ended up paying twice as much.. nearly £700. This put me overdrawn! I called to complain and they sent an email stating I would be refunded.
I spent an anxious night worrying if I would have to go into the city to pick up this car, as I was still jnsurenit would be delivered to me.

This morning I get a call to confirm it all so that out my mind at ease. Then he asked if I would like to pay a bit extra teo avoid the extortionate excess charge. Worried that anything could happen, I agreed to pay it.via a credit card. I had to pay £180, then I would pay the deposit on that card qhen the car arrived.
I then got a call to day their system can't process the payment and it had to be via the original card.
So, with the deposit of 250, plus the reduced excess payment, it would be £317.00
I'm upset now, as I've had to borrow money to pay into that account to cover it.
I'm stressed, upset and broke, and all because I wanted to hire a car for one week!!
What a terrible system that they just keep taking money off you on top of previous payments...
I will never use them again. If I didn't need a car for the next week, I would have definitely cancelled this booking.
It's literally cost me a grand!! If I was allowed to use expletives on here, believe me, I would!!!</div>

                <div class='text'>Truly awful service for disabled customers – avoid if you can

If you are disabled and rely on Motability, avoid Europa Car Belfast at all costs. Unfortunately, they have the contract with Motability for hire cars if your vehicle breaks down – but that “service” is virtually non-existent.

They rarely answer the phone, and when they finally do, they lie. I was told a car would be ready for me in 2 days. That never happened. A week later, I still have no car, no update, and no way of knowing when (or if) I’ll get one.

I am disabled and live in a remote area with no access to shops or medical appointments without a vehicle. This delay has left me completely stranded and put my health at risk. The lack of care or urgency for a disabled customer’s needs is absolutely shocking.

Europa Car Belfast have shown themselves to be unreliable, dishonest, and completely unsympathetic to the needs of vulnerable people. If you have any other option, take it – because you cannot count on them.</div>

                <div class='text'>Hired a car from the Gloucestershire branch, when asked if I needed to know anything about driving in the UK all I was told you drive on the same side of the road as in Australia. I returned the vehicle some 25 hours before the due date and time and never received a refund. Upon my return to Australia I received an email and infringement notice to say I drove in the coach lane at Manchester Airport for 34 seconds. I paid this fine and also received a further invoice of 45 UK pound for Europcar for passing on the original fine. When I questioned this I received an email to say my query was being investigated and I would be notified soon. I did not received a refund for the early return of the car and I advised Europecar UK to use that money to cover the cost of typing my email address to cover the costs of passing on the infringement fine. Europcar UK charged my credit card without my knowledge for the said 45 UK pound. To use my credit card without my authorization is criminal and I believe this to be corporate fraud. I am still await the 'outcome' of Europcar UK investigation. Would NOT recommend Europcar UK to any future hirers.</div>

                <div class='text'>I am giving this Company a 1 star review, because I cannot give them any less.
I was given a hire 'car' by my insurance company while mine was being repaired. I am nearly 70 and need a car to get around, so when my car went in for some repairs, the repair company stated that their courtesy cars were too small for me, (I am quite tall) Europcar were my insurers choice to give me a suitable car. They contacted me top say that they had not got an SUV as requested, but would give me something as close to an SUV as possible. What they supplied was a 9seater mini bus.
I tried to contact them to explain that the 'car' was not suitable but every time I called, I was constantly put on hold. I even completed their contact us form only for them to send me a standard reply email 2 weeks after the van had been returned. Do not accept anything from this firm unless you are happy with the size of vehicle and the condition. make sure that you take an all round video just in case they try to con you for damage that you have not caused.</div>

                <div class='text'>CROOKS. Booked in advance but because they wouldnt accept different cards we had we were forced to take out their insurance for the week which was more than the cost of the car hire. We had arranged our own insurance at a tenth of the price but they would not even look at the paperwork. It was late with only a few other companies open and limited availability. When I asked why the insurance was so high they said it was a local insurance company. Never given a policy document just €268 item on the bill. We still had to pay a deposit. Read other reviews and see this is a common scam by them.</div>

They arranged for a LWB van to be delivered and this had a front tyre that was 1/3 bald ! The driver said you can take it to Kwikfit and they will change it for you , as it's our problem we willpay for it ! Oh yeah , sure I'm going to waste a few hours of my time for a problem caused by them. On top of that he said he saw the Luton was missing the number plate the day before , but thought he would keep quiet and not report it to the office !!! Unbelievable .... Then they would not answer the phone at the local depot and I did not get a hire at all ! I wish Trustpilot gave you the option to give a minus score s it would be -5 !

                <div class='text'>False advertising from Europcar:

I booked an EV for a holiday in Spain. Online booking process says "full recharge not required" – but the collection desk argued I must recharge it before returning it.

They finally agreed when I showed them the website, and said they'd make a note on my booking. Obviously my choice was either sign the paperwork and trust them, or leave with no car for my holiday (plus they'd keep my deposit?).

So I had to trust them, and when I got home they invoiced me for recharging the car and took the payment from my credit card.

When I filed a dispute, they just replied saying that's the terms I agreed to when I signed. I keep asking about the false advertising, but they just ignore that question.

Won't use them again as this broke my trust.</div>

                <div class='text'>We returned our car to Izmir Airport on 21/06/25, and as of 13/08/25 are yet to have our €300 security deposit returned.

We have made multiple phone calls and emails to attempt to get this resolved and are yet to hear anything back. We waited 30 working days, as advised, before emailing the Customer Service UK email address on 01/06/25, and only received a NoReply, automated response on 06/08/25 with no real update or additional information regarding our query- it was clear that it was sent automatically and not by a real person.

Europcar are contractually obliged to return this money to us, yet we do not have it- or any correspondence from them about it at all!

We will begin pursuing legal action if we do not hear back or receive our money back by the end of the week.

This is unfortunate because the car itself was lovely and the staff in Turkey very helpful, and the staff who assisted in making the booking were also helpful. We only went with Europcar because we believed them to be reputable, but will not be using them again after this experience.

If Europcar would like to reach out as a response to this review then I would very much welcome it, as all we really want at this point is our money back. I will be happy to provide our booking reference if so.</div>

                <div class='text'>I had a prepaid car rental voucher for a predetermined type vehicle through a third-party provider. I went to collect the vehicle from EuropCar Gatwick South Terminal to be told by the female EuroCar employee that the vehicle we ordered was not available. She said “We are giving you a free upgrade”. No mention of cost we would pay etc. because we were told they were GIVING us an upgrade. GIVING! It is my understanding that under law, if the company cannot provide the car ordered (and paid for) they must offer either a free upgrade or a lesser vehicle with a monetary refund, The upgrade was a very luxurious vehicle and I was immediately resistant and anxious and expressed deep concern to her, I was told by the female agent not to worry, the vehicle was at the end of its rental life, it had 50,000 miles on the odometer, which it did, and it was to be disposed of when I returned it. Reluctantly I accepted it. I felt it had been foisted upon me. When I was outside loading the car, the female agent came out and said the car had damaged wheels and I had to sign a form to acknowledge the damage. She presented form with a diagram of the car, both sides, with X marks on the wheels. I now realise she had folded the paper in half so that I couldn’t see what was on the other side. I really thought the shonky, trickster days of car hire had long gone. Boy was I wrong!!!
In hindsight I should have said NO! NO! NO and I should have run away, screaming, and rung the third-party provider and complained, but I didn’t, fool that I am. However, after 26 hours of travel I was exhausted, and yes, I now know I was dimwitted not to spot a scam in the making.
I hated the car from the start. This car wrecked my entire holiday and nearly wrecked me. I was highly anxious when I drove it and it made me quite ill from worry, It was too large and too wide for UK parking spaces. It literally got stuck in the entry to a shopping centre car park. It gave my daughter high level anxiety attacks. I had to try to park it away from other cars because I was terrified they would dent the car’s doors. This car was just too big,and too wide for UK narrow roads, even some A roads were scary and it did things I found hard to accept. It was so technical it was dangerous, simply because it was distracting.
But just as importantly, mechanically it was difficult. When the car started off there were many times when it just didn’t want to change up gears. Leaving Cobham Services, the car wouldn’t change gears at all and I held my breath thinking I would need a tow truck, but eventually it did change up. I am used to driving a Subaru with CVT automatic, but this vehicle had a habit of just stopping and not moving off. It would stop and go into Neutral and once you realised why the car wasn’t moving and what had happened, you had to go through the set process to get it going again. This happened in dangerous places at times like waiting to enter a large roundabout on a 70mph road. A friend suggested I return the car and I jolly well wish I had.
On the day I had to return the car to Gatwick, a yellow message about the tyres appeared on the consol. 8 calls to EuropCar proved useless and so I drove just down the road to the local dealership for the marque. Service personnel said it was ok to drive it back and gave me instructions as to what to do with the gadget in the trunk should tyre pressure deteriorate. And this is how I returned the car.
During the term of the car hire I did check my credit card several times to see if EuropCar had levied the £1500 block for security and I was surprised they had not. I returned the car on 1 August and flew home. The day after I arrived home, I checked my credit card and found that at between the 29 July and 9 August (8 days after I had returned the car) EuropCar had charged me $3,630.06 in my money for the upgrade they told me they were GIVING me because they were unable to supply the car I had ordered and prepaid for. It was then that I remembered the woman who asked me to sign the document acknowledging the damage to the car, and it was then that I realised she had folded the document in half and therefore I could not see what was on the other side-the upgrade charges etc.What a Fool I am
I have lodged a dispute but EuropCarUK is notorious for completely ignoring disputes. I am told that what this woman did could be a criminal offence called Fraudulent Misrepresentation. Some could ask whether she is highly skilled in the dark arts of duplicity and deception? Of course I will not be letting this matter go and others in the travel and insurance industries have been advised. Eventually when I can confidently tell the Citizens Advice Bureau,Trading Standards,Watchdog and Rip-off Britain that EuropCar has done absolutely nothing to resolve my dispute,then I will lodge a dispute with the BVRLA to whom EuropCar belong.</div>

                <div class='text'>I booked a car for the month of August 25 and needed to make a small correction to the pickup location all other details remained the same - duration timings etc. I notified the customer care department almost immediately to explain the situation. I was subsequently notified that there was nothing they could do with 5 days notice before pickup and that I would either need to pick up the car as per the original booking or lose the rental money 840 pounds. I am on holiday, required the car for the duration of the holiday and was forced to rent another car whilst I contest the problem - simply ridiculous people.
I got no help from customer care, I raised a claim ( complaint) and was told the SLA for turnaround was up to 5 working days. Needless to say no reply to the complaint, it’s like pulling teeth with the zombies in customer care and now need to take them to an arbitration court.
Be very careful folk, this is a company that I have since found out are notorious for this type of thing and other abuses.
Will never touch these clowns again for the sake of my health.</div>

No phone call from them to say they have a vehicle or they don’t just leaving us not knowing what’s going on. Would definitely not recommend if you are in need of a courtesy car or to talk to you just get fobbed off and then the line goes dead when they redirect you or they just don’t answer.</div>

                <div class='text'>We have been waiting at Dublin airport for 2 hours for car and it is still “ being washed” with no exact time as to when it will be ready. Staff friendly but not helpful - they just keep saying it’s other people’s faults for not returning car quick enough and they can’t give us a time frame!!! We have a disabled elderly person with us who needs to eat but staff unconcerned about this as we stand waiting in their crowded office for hours with no cafe anywhere nearby. We also have 4 people waiting in Dublin City for us so we will be missing the first half day of our holiday! I would definitely NOT recommend this company! I am watching people quickly collect their cars from other providers!

                <div class='text'>If I could rate as 0 I would do. Worst experience of any car hire company in my life. Our flight was delayed with Jet2 by 2 hours. They charged us for our flight being late. They checked the car over after the rental period, everything was fine and the employee signed the rental off. A month later we were charged £100 for out of hours, and £100 for our car needing to be cleaned. The Spanish guy we spoke to was like a robot and would not let us speak to a manager or give us a manager's email and only blandly gave us the basic customer services number. Please do not use this car hire firm. They are the worst sort of people to do business with and you could magically have £200 taken from your credit card and be in an utter battle to get it refunded.</div>

                <div class='text'>We had to get a car from Eurocar as our mobility car needed to go in for repair. When handed back they charged my card 50 pounds, i disputed it and they said actually we should have been charged 30, still I would debate. I cancelled them taking anymore money from me but every couple of days they are trying to take 30 pounds remembering I have already overpaid and I am awaiting a refund. Customer service hang up now as we would like our refund instead of paying them money, formal complaint don’t reply. Receiving texts saying we owe them money. Been so stressful. I can’t believe the mobility scheme use them. This is a horrible experience. If you would like to feel abused then call Eurocar.</div>

                <div class='text'>I’m extremely disappointed with Europcar. When I picked up my car at Birmingham Airport, I clearly declined additional protection cover, as I had already purchased my own insurance.
Despite this, I was still charged £281.57 for an extra package I never agreed to. The agent made no effort to explain the charges, and I only realised later when the amount appeared on my invoice.
This feels like a deliberate upsell — especially knowing that staff may be incentivised to add extras. Europcar refused to refund me, so I’ve had to escalate to the BVRLA and my credit card provider.

                <div class='text'>Rented from Europcar Luton Airport and had a terrible experience.

1️⃣ Hidden & Duplicate Charges
My booking clearly stated that Airport Surcharge and Vehicle Licence Fee were prepaid. But after returning the car, I was charged again for: Licenses and Fees &
Premium Station Surcharge

Europcar claimed these were “not charged again,” just shown again. Yet, £214.41 was deducted from my credit card — part of which they admit was £180.18 for Roadside Assistance, which I never intended to buy. That leaves £34.23 unexplained.

2️⃣ Misleading Upselling
Despite already having full insurance, I was pressured to buy Roadside Assistance at pickup. The staff explicitly told me it would not cost extra and was “included in the basic insurance.” This is clearly false and designed to exploit tourists unfamiliar with UK rental terms.

3️⃣ Admin Fees Without Proof
Charged £45 per “admin fee” for supposed fines or tolls — yet no evidence or notice was ever provided.

❗ Avoid Europcar. It will give you nothing but a deeply unpleasant experience. Nothing else.</div>

                <div class='text'>Forced premium insurance

Rented a car for a week in Birmingham at EuroPcar

Had a full insurance over booking.com and when I arrived at the place to pick up the car, the staff just told me that their system can't accept the insurance that I bought over booking.com

The staff then forced me to buy one of their premium insurances before they would give me the keys to the car while then getting in contact with a person. They knew who to call at booking.com to force the cancelation of my insurance from there. My original price when I booked the car was around 60 pounds which then was changed to 250 + 100 in deposit.

The choice I had were 250 gbp + 100 gbp in deposit for full insurance
150 gbp + 200 gbp in deposit for half insurance
and the most outrages one was 87 gbp + 700 gbp in deposit for only windshield insurance

Had to talk with the support 3 times and on the second time I called in toto hear about the deposit. The lady on the phone just said I should wait and placed me on a waiting line just to end the call.
I tried it once more after half an hour and spoke with someone who tried to help me.

And just for the icing on top , I get a a late notification about a parking ticket when I dropped of my partner.
It was sent extremely late.</div>

                <div class='text'>I rarely leave reviews, but my experience with Europcar was frustrating enough to warrant one.

First, when we arrived to collect our rental, we were expecting the MG ZS SUV we had booked months earlier. Instead, the woman at the desk tried to hand us a much smaller car — one that wouldn’t have fit our luggage. When we pointed this out, she suddenly offered us a van instead. We had to insist multiple times that we had paid for an SUV and expected what we reserved.

After “checking with the fleet manager” (twice), she miraculously located the exact vehicle we had booked — which had apparently been “unavailable” moments earlier. When we reached the car park, we saw at least half a dozen other MG ZS SUVs in plain sight, and another couple who had also just been given a van instead of the car they were promised.

Then came the handling of a parking fine administration fee. I had already successfully disputed the fine and notified Europcar with evidence before they charged my card. Despite this, they still took the £45 fee and made me chase them down multiple times — even rejecting a screenshot of the cancellation and demanding a PDF version of the exact same message. This is not how you treat a customer — especially one who proactively followed the rules and provided the relevant information in good faith.

If this is how Europcar handles both reservations and basic customer service, I’d strongly recommend choosing a different company.</div>

                <div class='text'>On my recent rental from Europcar in the UK I was invoiced and charged for an additional 2 days, they decided that I collected the vehicle 2 days before I actually did. My card was charged and it took over 3 weeks to return the funds to my account.
The same rental also attempted to charge me for pre-existing damage that was "100% not there before I rented the vehicle", despite the damage being indicated on the rental agreement, they finally dropped the case when I provided photos and videos of the vehicle and the damage whilst the vehicle was at the collection depot.
Do not trust Europcar, they will try and rob you and if you prove that they are in the wrong they will offer no more than an insincere apology for the inconvenience.</div>

                <div class='text'>Appalling and ongoing experience. We have our own excess Insurence as we travel regularly. Our car got a small scratch on thd side while we were away from it and it was parked. We had 950£ THEN another 700£ taken from our credit card then another bill for 1000euros.. The company claim they are looking into this as but dispite many calls we are no further forward and can't claim from our Insurence yet. DO NOT USE TJIS COMPANY!!!!!!!!</div>

                <div class='text'>Hired a car from europcar in montpellier returned car with no damage except one stolen wheel cap, i assumed the hundred euros taken from my deposit covered that, also got a report back stating no damage except a scuff on the boot which we took a photo of on picking up the car, my partner had paid the bill on pick up but approx two weeks later they took 304 euros out of her bank account stating it was for damage, i put in a complaint and will see what happens, if the money is not returned i will contact the ECRCS just a warning for anybody contemplating hiring a car from these bandits.</div>

                <div class='text'>Europcar have charged us 3 times instead of once for our booking. We paid on credit card and didn't realise until we got the bill which we are now obliged to pay to avoid interest charges so that is 100's of £. We reported this to Europcar 11 days ago and they are still "investigating" even though we sent them all the paper work highlighting their error straight away. VERY poor service all round.</div>

                <div class='text'>Picked up a car in Stansted airport London. After we picked up the car we talked about that the talk we had with the sales guy at the pickup reception ended up more as he needed to sell us an upgrade than listen to our needs .... and we ended up with a car we actually didn't need. Not a good experience.</div>

                <div class='text'>Picked up car from Italy - Rimini. Ordered a VW Tiguan, received a citreon of a completely different category (2 categories lower than what we ordered). Still not have received a refund for the difference.
Then returned the car within the permitted 29 minute grace period, the Europcar employee put on the Statement of Return that we returned the car 55 minutes late, completely false information and they have tried to charge us for an extra day - but we LUCKILY have the car parking ticket to prove this is wrong.

DO NOT USE IF YOU WANT A STRESS FREE HOLIDAY and without being falsely charged/stolen from</div>

                <div class='text'>I booked a specific car class but was downgraded without any explanation. Not only was the replacement vehicle smaller and less comfortable, but I was also never offered a refund or compensation for the downgrade. My reservation number is 1182910408, Customer service has been unhelpful and unresponsive. This experience was frustrating and completely unacceptable — I expected better. I won’t be booking with them again.</div>
