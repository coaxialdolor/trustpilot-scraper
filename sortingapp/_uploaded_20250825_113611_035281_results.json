      "text": "Terrible Experience – Avoid Europcar Porto\n\nI rented an electric vehicle from Europcar Porto, but when I arrived to collect it, I was told I needed to use a third-party app and have a Portuguese debit card – something that was never mentioned during the booking process. Since I didn’t have that, I was essentially forced into “upgrading” to a more expensive vehicle.\n\nTo make matters worse, they added taxes I had already paid and pushed an unnecessary insurance upgrade. The replacement vehicle was dirty, and the tire pressure system was faulty, clearly showing poor maintenance.\n\nAfter I returned the vehicle, they even attempted to charge my card again without authorization.\n\nOverall, this felt like a scam from start to finish. I won’t be using Europcar again – especially not at this location. Be warned."

She is still waiting for a refund and being fed a load of lies from Europcar even with them having accepted liability for the error and told her that the money was released 2 weeks ago. Its now a month since it happened. On top of this, the car has been returned and their pre authorisations have not been released and the deposit has not been returned.\nTheir continued moving of timelines and this behavior has to be illegal as I do not understand how they can simply take money out of a bank account when the customer has not authorised it. Tesco can't do that with shopping."

      "text": "The booking.com website led me to Keddy by Europcar at Valencia airport in July with the promise of \"no queues\" but I had to wait more than 30 minutes to collect on arrival. I reserved a \"T-Roc or similar\" and tried to pre-empt me not getting \"or similar\" by contacting Europcar (Madrid) in advance. They responded with a \"we cannot promise anything\" and indeed when I arrived was given a Hyundai Tucson covered in scratches with a flogged engine 65k on the clock. Europcar then pre-authorised 800 Euros on my credit card in case of collision even though I had paid an extra 70 pounds to booking.com for full additional insurance (excess insurance). I hated the Hyundai Tucson. The safety features were infuriating with the parking brake auto-hold not having a light on the console and the locked patrol cap. The staff were very polite at Europcar Valencia airport but the experience was a let-down. One week after returning the car I noticed a further charge from Europcar on my credit card. When I contacted them they said it was an \"environmental contribution\" charged to me in error when it should have been charged to the intermediary (i.e. booking.com). Long story short I would avoid using either Europcar or booking.com for a car rental in the future."

I inspected the car reasonably thoroughly and could not see any damage.\n\nOn returning the car the member of staff immediately identified what she claimed was damage but to my mind was a mark on the rear bumper that was hardly visible and not possible to see without wiping away the water marks. Nevertheless, the staff member required me to sign the Statement of Return acknowledging the damage. She told me that is it was the only way I would get my deposit back and also implied that the damage would be assessed by an expert and would probably not be an issue. As I was in a hurry to catch my flight I signed document."

      "text": "Unbelievable experience with this awful company and the partner companies I have had to deal with.\nBooked a Citroen C3 fuel car for 12 days in Tolouse in late July. (almost £300 total) . I used the GOTrentalcars website to book the car from Europcar.\n\nMy Ryanair flight was late so I got to the Europcar at 12.30am. They did not have the Citroen C3. They insisted I had booked an electric car of the lowest category. ( Major Red Flag) I insisted I hadn't because I deliberately excluded electric cars when booking. The electric car they wanted to give me could only drive for 1 hour before needing charging. I would never have willingly booked this.\n\nThey only had 1 fuel car to offer me but it was going to cost an extra £60 PER DAY!!! I was absolutely stuck, I had a young child with me and it was 1am on a saturday night, I had to drive for 1.5 hours to get to our accomodation. I was forced to get the fuel car at £60 extra per day but they said I could try and explain the next day and change it. All day Sunday and Monday was ruined because I was trying to sort out the situation on the phone and eventually just had to go back to return the car and try to get refunded for the 10 days. But they still have not refunded me. ( RED FLAG - staff directly lied to me)\nHowever the Europcar staff at Toulouse airport were completely UNHELPFUL and RUDE. RED FLAG. I had an argument with them in the Toulouse airport. I parked the car near their returns office and went away for an hour.\n\nWhen I came back to return the car, they said there was a dimple on the rear door. RED FLAG! I KNOW that I hadn't ever touched this door or seen the dimple when I checked the car over. I think they did it out of malice for my complaining. I asked to check cctv but there wasnt any. They forced me to sign a thing saying I had created the dimple. I definitely did not. It is so small that I took a close-up photo and you still can't see it. They have taken £800 out of my bank account. They have not even refunded me 10 days' worth of £ that I had paid.\n\nEvery staff member that I spoke to from GOTrental cars and Europcar says I signed the contract in the first place for the car. I keep saying I was FORCED to sign it because I was stuck in the middle of the night with a child and they did not have the car I had booked. I am being totally GASLIT by these theiving, tricking, fraudulent blatant liars, and they now owe me £1200 plus 2 days of my holiday plus petrol and toll money to return the wrong car.\n\nTHEY WILL NOT GET AWAY WITH THIS."

This was deemed excessive and upon querying the matter, I was told this would require 'expert third party cleaners ' and 'the cleaning of a interior specialist'.\n\nDirect quotes, yet evidence of this was never produced and I was ignored for over a month before receiving a dismissive email saying they will not be replying any more.\n\nIf only photos were allowed on this platform to show how little dirt was apparently deemed to be excessive. I have since moved to using other car rental companies, as this lack of customer service for a long-standing customer, or anyone, is just not good enough.\n\nI will be reporting them to the British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association for breaching their code of conduct in their handling of this matter."

I gave up on that and called the head office of Europcar to discuss the matter. The woman name was lynne who insisted that they had sent a email for recovery of damage. I then checked my junk mail and found 2 emails from Europcar. One was the invoice from them on the 04/06/2025 saying the car was ok and the deposit would be returned\nWhich it was by Europcar.\n\nThen on the the 23/06/2025 I have another email regarding the damage to the car ( which was a flat tyre and I picture of the tyre with the nail in it.\n3 weeks after the so called nail was in the tyre they contact me to inform me that I must of done it and they were going to charge me for the time it was off the road a new tyre and admin fees of 251.64. Something I did not know about til now.\nI know I checked the car out and it did not have a puncture as I checked all aspects at of it with a friend who assisted me in the process. At no point was the car damaged or anything wrong with it.\nHow can this company say the car was ok and issue an invoice on the 4th June 2025 and then 3 weeks later decide that the car had a puncture and decide to send me a bill.\nThey must of done this when driving the car round the car park or someone else who hired it and the only person they could blame was the last person who drove it. This is wrong on all levels and I will contest it as it looks like they are blaming anyone they can. Absolute disgrace from Europcar and as a company I used to use regularly I won’t be using again and I will tell anyone who is using this company do not use them as they are not true to there words of being a good company who cares about the drivers."

Europcar UK charged my credit card without my knowledge for the said 45 UK pound. To use my credit card without my authorization is criminal and I believe this to be corporate fraud. I am still await the 'outcome' of Europcar UK investigation. Would NOT recommend Europcar UK to any future hirers."

I am nearly 70 and need a car to get around, so when my car went in for some repairs, the repair company stated that their courtesy cars were too small for me, (I am quite tall) Europcar were my insurers choice to give me a suitable car. They contacted me top say that they had not got an SUV as requested, but would give me something as close to an SUV as possible. What they supplied was a 9seater mini bus.\nI tried to contact them to explain that the 'car' was not suitable but every time I called, I was constantly put on hold. I even completed their contact us form only for them to send me a standard reply email 2 weeks after the van had been returned. Do not accept anything from this firm unless you are happy with the size of vehicle and the condition. make sure that you take an all round video just in case they try to con you for damage that you have not caused."

We had arranged our own insurance at a tenth of the price but they would not even look at the paperwork. It was late with only a few other companies open and limited availability. When I asked why the insurance was so high they said it was a local insurance company. Never given a policy document just €268 item on the bill. We still had to pay a deposit. Read other reviews and see this is a common scam by them."

      "text": "I had a prepaid car rental voucher for a predetermined type vehicle through a third-party provider. I went to collect the vehicle from EuropCar Gatwick South Terminal to be told by the female EuroCar employee that the vehicle we ordered was not available. She said “We are giving you a free upgrade”. No mention of cost we would pay etc. because we were told they were GIVING us an upgrade. GIVING! It is my understanding that under law, if the company cannot provide the car ordered (and paid for) they must offer either a free upgrade or a lesser vehicle with a monetary refund, The upgrade was a very luxurious vehicle and I was immediately resistant and anxious and expressed deep concern to her, I was told by the female agent not to worry, the vehicle was at the end of its rental life, it had 50,000 miles on the odometer, which it did, and it was to be disposed of when I returned it. Reluctantly I accepted it. I felt it had been foisted upon me. When I was outside loading the car, the female agent came out and said the car had damaged wheels and I had to sign a form to acknowledge the damage. She presented form with a diagram of the car, both sides, with X marks on the wheels. I now realise she had folded the paper in half so that I couldn’t see what was on the other side. I really thought the shonky, trickster days of car hire had long gone. Boy was I wrong!!!\nIn hindsight I should have said NO! NO! NO and I should have run away, screaming, and rung the third-party provider and complained, but I didn’t, fool that I am. However, after 26 hours of travel I was exhausted, and yes, I now know I was dimwitted not to spot a scam in the making.\nI hated the car from the start. This car wrecked my entire holiday and nearly wrecked me. I was highly anxious when I drove it and it made me quite ill from worry, It was too large and too wide for UK parking spaces. It literally got stuck in the entry to a shopping centre car park. It gave my daughter high level anxiety attacks. I had to try to park it away from other cars because I was terrified they would dent the car’s doors. This car was just too big,and too wide for UK narrow roads, even some A roads were scary and it did things I found hard to accept. It was so technical it was dangerous, simply because it was distracting.\nBut just as importantly, mechanically it was difficult. When the car started off there were many times when it just didn’t want to change up gears. Leaving Cobham Services, the car wouldn’t change gears at all and I held my breath thinking I would need a tow truck, but eventually it did change up. I am used to driving a Subaru with CVT automatic, but this vehicle had a habit of just stopping and not moving off. It would stop and go into Neutral and once you realised why the car wasn’t moving and what had happened, you had to go through the set process to get it going again. This happened in dangerous places at times like waiting to enter a large roundabout on a 70mph road. A friend suggested I return the car and I jolly well wish I had.\nOn the day I had to return the car to Gatwick, a yellow message about the tyres appeared on the consol. 8 calls to EuropCar proved useless and so I drove just down the road to the local dealership for the marque. Service personnel said it was ok to drive it back and gave me instructions as to what to do with the gadget in the trunk should tyre pressure deteriorate. And this is how I returned the car.\nDuring the term of the car hire I did check my credit card several times to see if EuropCar had levied the £1500 block for security and I was surprised they had not. I returned the car on 1 August and flew home. The day after I arrived home, I checked my credit card and found that at between the 29 July and 9 August (8 days after I had returned the car) EuropCar had charged me $3,630.06 in my money for the upgrade they told me they were GIVING me because they were unable to supply the car I had ordered and prepaid for. It was then that I remembered the woman who asked me to sign the document acknowledging the damage to the car, and it was then that I realised she had folded the document in half and therefore I could not see what was on the other side-the upgrade charges etc.What a Fool I am\nI have lodged a dispute but EuropCarUK is notorious for completely ignoring disputes. I am told that what this woman did could be a criminal offence called Fraudulent Misrepresentation. Some could ask whether she is highly skilled in the dark arts of duplicity and deception? Of course I will not be letting this matter go and others in the travel and insurance industries have been advised. Eventually when I can confidently tell the Citizens Advice Bureau,Trading Standards,Watchdog and Rip-off Britain that EuropCar has done absolutely nothing to resolve my dispute,then I will lodge a dispute with the BVRLA to whom EuropCar belong."

I am on holiday, required the car for the duration of the holiday and was forced to rent another car whilst I contest the problem - simply ridiculous people.\nI got no help from customer care, I raised a claim ( complaint) and was told the SLA for turnaround was up to 5 working days. Needless to say no reply to the complaint, it’s like pulling teeth with the zombies in customer care and now need to take them to an arbitration court.\nBe very careful folk, this is a company that I have since found out are notorious for this type of thing and other abuses.\nWill never touch these clowns again for the sake of my health."

      "text": "I rarely leave reviews, but my experience with Europcar was frustrating enough to warrant one.\n\nFirst, when we arrived to collect our rental, we were expecting the MG ZS SUV we had booked months earlier. Instead, the woman at the desk tried to hand us a much smaller car — one that wouldn’t have fit our luggage. When we pointed this out, she suddenly offered us a van instead. We had to insist multiple times that we had paid for an SUV and expected what we reserved.\n\nAfter “checking with the fleet manager” (twice), she miraculously located the exact vehicle we had booked — which had apparently been “unavailable” moments earlier. When we reached the car park, we saw at least half a dozen other MG ZS SUVs in plain sight, and another couple who had also just been given a van instead of the car they were promised.\n\nThen came the handling of a parking fine administration fee. I had already successfully disputed the fine and notified Europcar with evidence before they charged my card. Despite this, they still took the £45 fee and made me chase them down multiple times — even rejecting a screenshot of the cancellation and demanding a PDF version of the exact same message. This is not how you treat a customer — especially one who proactively followed the rules and provided the relevant information in good faith.\n\nIf this is how Europcar handles both reservations and basic customer service, I’d strongly recommend choosing a different company."

My card was charged and it took over 3 weeks to return the funds to my account.\nThe same rental also attempted to charge me for pre-existing damage that was \"100% not there before I rented the vehicle\", despite the damage being indicated on the rental agreement, they finally dropped the case when I provided photos and videos of the vehicle and the damage whilst the vehicle was at the collection depot.\nDo not trust Europcar, they will try and rob you and if you prove that they are in the wrong they will offer no more than an insincere apology for the inconvenience."

Such a dodgy company.\n\nWas forced into paying for the damage waiver in France as the operative simply would not stop badgering, knew I was in a rush and refused to give me the keys until I purchased the upgrade.\n\nThey tell you not to bother inspecting the car because you won’t be charged. THIS IS NOT TRUE. Dropping the car off there was a scratch on the paintwork which looked historic. Whilst I accept I should’ve checked and said something, I relied on what I was told that I didn’t need to check. I highlighted that the scratch looked historic and the operative at the other end even agreed. He told me to simply sign the form saying we’d spoken about it and not to worry as I wouldn’t be charged anyway as I had signed the damage waiver.\n\nWell, I wake up to a £100 “damage admin fee” - so I was charged. With my invoice I had a link to press to complain, this sent me to a form that I completed. The response to that form was “you’ve contacted the wrong Europcar, you need to contact Europcar France not Europcar UK”.\n\nThe buck-passing began there. I asked repeatedly why I wasn’t allowed to rely on the representations made that I wouldn’t be charged both before I signed the contract and after and was told the T&C’s applied (which was in direct contradiction to what I was told). The response was only “you signed the form acknowledging the damage”. If I had known about the charge (and gone against what 2 members of staff said too my face), I wouldn’t have signed it.\n\nBeware. Beware. Beware. They will hoodwink you, pressurise you and after all of that, still charge you. Hidden fees are their speciality it seems.\n\nWill never touch Europcar again and I can only recommend you do the same."

On the second of the two occasions I hired a car here, this lack of a pre-hire check was used in an attempt to make me pay for pre-existing damage to the wheel and tyre. The person I handed the car back to spotted this very minor blemish so quickly that I can only assume that they knew it was there and needed someone to pin it on.\n\nHowever, while Europcar doesn't do pre-hire checks, I do and I had photos to prove that the damage was there when I collected the car. The person I handed the car over to couldn't have been less interested in this despite this being an opportunity to wrap things up there and then. He was clearly desperate to pass this up the chain, claiming that he would get in trouble if he didn't.\n\nThe matter was passed to Europcar's damage team, who are slow, incompetent and impertinent. After almost a month of exchanges, Europcar have gracelessly and grudgingly conceded that they were wrong and I've been informed that I will not be charged for damage that someone else caused.\n\nI certainly won't be using this shady outfit again. If you do, I'd strongly advise you to take a comprehensive and clear photographs of every aspect of the car, interior as well as exterior photographs. Time stamp them if possible.

      "text": "I would like to give a review about my experience at Europcar by Birmingham airport today. The front desk employee named “Bryan” (black guy at desk) mistreated me and my uncle so badly today. I came to the branch desperate for a car as I broke down and I needed something for the morning to commute to work. The first thing Bryan told me and reassured me was dont worry we have enough cars for you today and showed me all the cars they had in the carpark. I felt a bit better because thats what I needed to hear. Once he found out that Im desperate for a car as I broken down and once he found out what do I do for work everything changed. So online it was showing they have availabity for an Audi A3 coming all together around £250 for 4 days (second driver included) I did not book it online as I was unsure if they accept debit or credit card. So I turned up to the branch, even then I needed my uncle to book as I am currently waiting for my debit card to come home so in this case he would pay , and I can transfer him the money and I can drive to work.\nLet’s go back at the point when “Bryan” found out how desperate I was for a car. He only offered me a Fiat punto for first £389, (after I told my uncle to make way and come to the branch) then I asked him how come online it says I can get an audi for almost half the price he said no you cannot no you cannot without giving me an answer as I was confused. Fair enough he wanted me to pay double, my uncle asked a question so which other cars do you have and Bryan looked at him weird asking for translation as my uncle english is not perfect but he is a manager at a wholesale place I can assure he has a degree, who is Bryan to make joke of his english?. This completely made me think he was being racist to us. I then asked, ok so what if I book a car for 2 hours later as per online procedure and it was showing I can get an A3 for £250 for 4 days what would you do then if you saying you cannot give me that one as its gone? He did not bother giving me a proper answer and instead of helping me save money or finding a solution to my problem he decided to just say mate you can have the Fiat punto for £456 now or I’ll just tell you to walk out mate. What? So the price gone up for me asking few questions or my uncle asking a question?\nTHIS IS NOT HOW YOU TREAT A CUSTOMER IN NEED OF HELP, I DO NOT KNOW WHO GAVE TRAINING TO THIS GUY BUT PEOPLE AT DESKS ARE MEANT TO HELP CUSTOMER AND NOT CHARGE EXTRA EXTORTION PRICES. IM REALLY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS EXPERIENCE AS I WASTED ALMOST 3 HOURS OF MY TIME AND ALL I GOT IN RETURN WAS THIS GUY TRYING TO SHOW HIS POWER AND BE RACIST TO MY UNCLE PLUS STRESS TO FIND A CAR FOR MORNING. Really disappointed in you guys, because of Bryan I will have to catch a taxi early in the morning and back home. Meanwhile the other guy at the desk was the opposite, he went home at 7.30/8 pm but was willing to help his attitude was really nice I wish he stayed and dealt with my query. Also the guy bringing the cars was really kind too. Bryan Instead he could have decided to help me saying, mate book it for the morning or tomorrow online it might be cheaper or better cars etc….Is this how you treat customers in need of help? Charge extra amounts to show your powers? I have rented cars of you guys before and a lot of my friends and family have in the past hence I came. But after this experience with BRYAN do you think they would want to book again?"

I contacted Europcar at the time and was told I would be reimbursed for the oil purchase.\n\nI provided the receipt as requested, but since then I’ve been ignored. No refund, no reply, and no explanation, despite multiple follow-ups.\n\nIt’s not about the small amount of money — it’s the principle. If Europcar can’t follow through on a basic reimbursement they agreed to, I’d question how they handle more serious issues.\n\nDisappointing experience. If you value accountability and clear communication, I’d think twice before booking with Europcar."

      "text": "Europcar Heathrow.\nArrived off a 32-hour flight from New Zealand. Tired and disorientated I arrived at the desk ready to produce my CarTrawler.com voucher for the 30-day rental. This was not required, apparently. I asked about an upgrade to a car with automatic transmission and was told that one was available at an additional 25 GBP per day. I was told by Danielle that because she was not (now) going to be charging me for the additional driver (upon the return of the vehicle) that additional cost would only ‘feel’ like 5 GBP per day as the additional driver would have otherwise been charged at 20 GBP per day. We signed the documents, drove away and then 30 minutes later realised we’d been well and truly conned by Danielle.\n\nThe cost of the additional driver, for the original vehicle or for the upgrade was NOT 20 GBP per day (or 600 GBP in total). It’s only 186 GBP for the whole period (according to their website) for the upgraded vehicle. I phoned Customer Services from a service station on the M5, who also said that the 186 was too cheap and it they’d never offer an additional driver for less that 13 GBP per day.\n\nSo, having already paid 1,034 GBP for the original vehicle I was stung for another 1,035 GBP for the upgrade. The payment was taken out of my bank account, and this prompted an email to their customer services. Several emails later, during which I was told that “You’ve signed the documents, so you had to pay”, and that “I (the customer service rep) was not there when you had the conversation with Danielle, so I can’t confirm or corroborate what was said and so can’t offer a refund for the difference” etc etc, it went on.\n\nThe upgrade vehicle, should I have booked that originally, would have cost me 1,390 +186 = 1,576. I was conned out of 492 GBP. I wasn’t asking for a refund for the whole amount, just this difference. I would have been happy to pay the correct price for the vehicle that I had.\n\nThe whole ‘show’ was a farce. “For this deal I need to get my manager to sign this off. It’s that good” (Danielle). The whole things was a well-practiced hustle.\n\nThis whole experience really played on my mind for the whole of my holiday in the UK. This experience and realisation of their wrongdoing was something I was unable to reconcile with.\n\nAvoid, avoid, avoid. I hope my that by writing this I can help others to avoid a similar experience.\n\nReply from Owner following my Google review . .\n\"Hello David,\n\nWe appreciate your feedback and we are sorry to learn you were dissatisfied with our service.\n\nGive us the chance to solve the issue by providing more details using this link **** where our customer service team will be in touch.\"\n\nTotal waste of time. No change in stance, just \"Europcar UK have provided you with an explanation for the fee you raised. Based on the information available and the explanation from Europcar UK, we regret to inform you that the upgrade fee is valid and cannot be waived.\""

When I declined, I was rudely dismissed and then told the only option was a tiny Fiat 500 — completely unsuitable for a family.\n\nOther customers were facing the same issue, including those who had booked weeks in advance. The staff were rude, unhelpful, and took a “tough luck” attitude with everyone. I was even told it was my fault for booking “too late” — despite their system accepting my payment and confirming availability.\n\nThe whole experience was chaotic, unprofessional, and completely ruined the start of our family holiday. I had to get a refund and find an alternative at the last minute. Easily the worst customer service I’ve ever experienced. Never again."

After several minutes of selling, the upgrade would have cost a ridiculous amount so we stuck with our original car. The real bug bear is that we verbally agreed to return the car with a full tank of petrol, which we refilled at Birchanger services next to Stansted. Expecting a refund of the fuel deposit we paid of £47.04 and after re fuelling at a further cost of £18.63 thus totalling £65.67. Did we receive the deposit back, No. We contacted Europcar who opened a case but sadly even though the vehicle showed we had refilled the car to the exact amount that was in the tank originally they would not refund the deposit. This seems to us to be extremely unfair. Be very wary."

      "text": "I rented a van from Europcar on the 13th of June and returned it the following day, the 14th. While I’ll admit their vehicles are quite lovely and modern, that’s about the only good thing I can say. The rest of the experience was a full-blown disaster.\nI used the van to move boxes to my new house, driving a total of just 38 miles. However, when I went to refill the tank before returning it, I had to put in 14.61 litres of diesel. That’s laughably excessive. For context, I drive a diesel SUV 64 miles round-trip to work daily, and that uses only 4–5 litres. So how did 38 miles in a van burn through nearly triple that?\nThe answer is simple: the vehicle wasn’t filled up properly when I received it. The digital fuel gauge can be deceiving, giving the impression of a full tank even when it’s not. I mentioned this immediately upon return, only to be told that maybe the heavy boxes I moved caused it. A flimsy excuse at best.\nI raised a formal complaint online on June 15th, expecting the promised \"7 working day\" resolution. It's now well past that, and I’ve received nothing but silence and disgraceful customer service. I've been hung up on twice after providing my complaint reference, and on one occasion, I was subjected to the rudest, most unhelpful call imaginable. Not once did anyone seem remotely interested in resolving the issue.\nIf you're thinking of using Europcar, don’t unless you’re prepared to be ignored, insulted, and treated like a nuisance the moment you raise a concern. Their complaint process is more like a black hole. Once you're in, expect no return.\nAvoid Europcar. Their shiny cars hide a rusty, soulless machine underneath."

This meant the office would be closed when we arrived at midnight. I phoned the local office to tell them I would be arriving late hoping they would stay open the extra 30 minutes. They told me that they wouldn’t stay open longer and if I don’t collect before they closed I would be a “no show” and I would lose my booking and all the pre paid money. I asked if i could collect the next morning, and was told no because they would have already cancelled the booking and put me down as now show. They suggested I call customer\nServices, which would be great but that was closed at 4pm on Sunday. I tried to modify my booking online but that was just trying to charge me £300 more to have a booking 1 day shorter. To avoid the no show fee I had to cancel the booking online. WHY could I not just pick up the car a day later as I had already paid the full amount!! Side note noticed the hertz desk has stayed open late to meet the flight. After starting a customer complaint, Europcar informed me they re within their rights to not refund my deposit as I didn’t give 48 hours notice to cancel. This leads me to think they would have actually kept all my money and put me as a no “show “. Will not be using Europcar again and hope others learn from my experience."

It wasn’t.\n\nTwo days into the hire, I called to extend the booking by 2 days — exactly as instructed — and was told I’d have to pay £420. That’s more than the original £380 for 10 days, just for 2 more days! Even more outrageous, I checked online and the same car was available for £170 over the same 2-day period.\n\nWhen I asked why, I was told the only option was to return the vehicle all the way back to Edinburgh Airport (a 140-mile round trip for me), start a new booking, and drive off again — all for something I was told could be handled over the phone for an additional £80 total.\n\nI raised this as a complaint and was told to contact the Edinburgh depot directly. After 5 separate attempts and 5 hours on hold over 2 days, I gave up — which I suspect is exactly what they count on.\n\nI went back to the main number and asked to speak with customer service, only to be told:\n“It’s what the computer says — there’s nothing we can do.”\n\nAbsolutely disgraceful service, zero accountability, and pricing that borders on predatory.\nBE AWARE before booking with Europcar.\n\nReservation number:\n1191262518"

The desk staff said they would sell it to me for £24, so I accepted. When my credit card bill came through, they had charged me £24 a day! They also charged me around an extra £50 to collect the car!

      "text": "I hired a car from Trieste Ronchi Airport on 22 June 2025, and returned it in Bologna on Thur. 26 June.\n\nThe pick up process went OK, but the car's conditions were worse than those described on the contract. This forced me to take something like 18 pictures of various damages and return to the office to report one of them in particular. This was particularly unpleasant as I had to do this under the scorching sun at about 37 degrees; it would be greatly appreciated if Europcar could rent some parking slots in the shade.\n\nBut the worst was still to come. The documentation I had been emailed when I booked contained 2 different addresses where to return the car in Bologna. When I asked about this on the pick-up day, the person behind the desk (Sig.ra Ilenia) said that, actually, both of these addresses were wrong, and gave me a third address (\"V. Matteotti, 5 - Bologna\"). She mentioned that, when I reached the car park, I should go to level -1. That was it.\n\nOn the last day, car return time was 15:00. Google map said it would take me 15 minutes to drive to the alleged return address (Via Matteotti, 5); I left at 1:45pm (1h 15min early).\nIndeed, after less than 20 mins, I reached \"via Matteotti\"; however, when I started looking for no. 5, there was no “no. 5” anywhere. The numbering jumped from no. 1 to no. 7; in between, there was a huge bridge over the railway, and, after the bridge, Bologna's main Railway Station's car park.\nThe car park entrance had no indication suggesting that this might *also* be the place where rental cars had to be returned. There was NO Europcar sign to be seen anywhere, nor were there any other rental companies' signs, which would have hinted this could have been the correct location.\n\nI stopped and called Europcar office in Bologna for some indications. It was about 2:10-15pm. Nobody answered. I tried several times, for about 5 minutes, but nobody picked up.\n\nThe clock was ticking. Given that I had 3 (three) different addresses where to return the car, and that, amongst those, one was Europcar's main offices', I decided to drive there, as the address placed it nearby.\nAfter another 10 minutes, I managed to locate Europcar's office entrance, parked, and walked there.\n\nIt was 14:30, under a scorching sun (37 degrees C). When I got there, the office was closed. The sign on the door said \"14:30\" as the afternoon opening times. I waited for a few minutes, while occasionally ringing the bell, and insistently knocking on the office door.\nNo answer. Nobody was visible through the glass windows.\nIt was now past 14:35, the return time was approaching, and the door remained closed. I tried to call Europcar's office number again: no answer.\nAt that point I noticed a small sign (written in Italian) next to the office's door, stating that, should the office be closed, the car key should be dropped off at Europcar's car park located in the ** main train station's car park ***. It was now clear that Bologna's rail station car park was where Europcar also had its own car park.\n\nBut the calvary wasn't over. I drove the car to the train station car park, went to level -1 (where, finally, a \"Europcar\" sign showed up) and parked.\nI had a look around, but there were no signs as to where to find the key drop box; there were no Europcar's desks anywhere. I walked to the top / ground floor, found a railways office, where a staff member of the national railways very kindly told me he believed the key box was on floor -1. He was not a Europcar staff, so he wasn't supposed to know this. I assume he knew as he had already come across tens of people who, like me, were looking for the same piece of information.\nI then went back to level -1, where I found two other people equally lost and looking for the drop box: someone else had told them that it was at level -2, not -1. I decided to believe the railways staff member (for the reasons above) and we started walking around on level -1. Finally, in a very remote, dark corner of the car park, partly hidden by other cars, there it was, Europcar's key drop box.\nIt was now 2:55pm; I was drenched in sweat, and had spent 45' of my time doing this.\n\nTo sum up:\n1. Europcar's office *never* answered any of my calls; I tried also later in the afternoon, repeatedly. This is simply a disgrace;\n2. The documents I was sent contained 2 different addresses where to return the car, both incorrect;\n3. Car conditions: some of the issues were not noted on the report I was given at car pick up;\n4. When I picked up the car, Europcar staff (Sig.ra Ilenia) did not clarify that the return car park happen to coincide with Bologna's main train station car park;\n5. Europcar's sign posting is abhorrent. A small sign next to the train station car park's entrance would have made this so much easier, as would some sign posting to the key drop box.\n\nOverall, I will never hire a car with Europcar again."

Then I got a follow up letter from their Collecting-Agents / Solicitors chasing payment of the Admin Fee. Again, I sent the correspondence to them and again Europcar assured me this was rescinded and they had corrected it in their systems. They obviously couldn't be bothered to actually do that. When I arrived at Heathrow (after a long flight) they said they could not provide a car to me because I was on the 'watchlist' for this very same 'outstanding invoice'. I realized exactly what the issue was, but the department I needed to talk to was closed for the weekend. When they opened a few days later, they confirmed they were in error & I should not have been denied rental - but it was way too late by then.\n\nAbsolutely appalling systemic incompetence on Europcars part."

Unfortunately, i was unable to dispute this at the time and rang Europcar customer service the next day to dispute this. I said I had photos, but they said they didn't need them at that time. However, 4 days later I get an e-mail saying that they were going to charge my credit card for the repair and they had attached the costs. There were no attachments! I immediately replied with the date/time stamped photos showing the pre-existing damage. 4 days later still no reply, other than the invoice for the repair! Europcar are obviously thinking \"Here comes an old man, I wonder how much money we can get off of him?\". Bunch of robbers! Never again!"

On pickup the car had a lot of damage but that doesn’t matter as all noted - photos taken including the horrific alloy conditions. After having driven 250 miles, the next morning I check the vehicle over before setting off on a business trip and notice a huge chunk of rubber missing from the tyre. I check and the damage was there from drop off - you can literally see the tyre cords. I could have had a major tyre blowout on a motorway. I have now called Europcar 6 - 6!! Times in the space of 2 hours and STILL no resolution. If nothing gets resolved I am leaving the car at the hotel and will be claiming the taxi and railway costs from Europcar. I need to get back home and will not drive a car that has major sidewall damage. This will be going straight to the ombudsman due to the utterly unsafe condition they have supplied this car in."

This was UNTIL the rep realised we had purchased fully comprehensive insurance and that both husband and wife would be driving. The key was swiftly removed from us and we were handed keys to a Dacia Sandero. All I can say is that this car looked like it had been owned by a succession of learner drivers. There were scratches and dents everywhere and the car wasnt particularly clean inside. The tyres were barely legal and in a bad state for the dusty roads. Total deception on our side as we paid over £500 for this experience (and were parked next to the shiny new Peugeot we were meant to be picking up). Will not ever use this company again and will be watching the credit card carefully now following other reviews."

I'm a Europcar regular - I'm looking at my online record and I see ten rentals in the last two and a bit years. These are private retals, spanning Portgal, France, Germany, Spain and the UK.\nI booked a Compact car ('Cupra Leon or similar' - that's a small hatchback. As on my last trip to Scotland, I was instead given a dreadful, wallowy, absolutely huge MG SUV. I asked for a smaller car at the desk, and was told I could have a BMW 1 series - for an extra £30 a day. I was told it's not possible to get the car I asked for without going premium - instead I had to put up with a bloated, rubbishy Chinese SUV.\nTo make things worse, the car stank of cigarettes - some previous user had been smoking in it. I complained before I drove away, and it was recorded (so I wouldn't have to pay for the damage - probably impossible to clean effectively) but I wasn't offered a change of vehicle.\nStill, at least there wasn't a queue. On two receent trips - to Toulouse in France in June, and to Portugal in April - I had to queue for more than an hour to collect the keys. There's no 'Privilege' desk any more for regular customers - no reward for customer loyalty, for filling out details in advance to speed things up. No, you queue with all the people who need every last comma on the contract explained to them, while staff try their hardest to up-sell. EVERY. STUPID. TIME.\nAnyway I'm getting utterly fed up with Europcar, I noted that queues at some other rental places are much shorter. I don't know if Hertz or Avis have a functioning loyalty programme but I might give them a try.\nI moved to the Europcar app after using brokers for years, after two unforunate experiences (with Greenmotion in Edinburgh, and Goldcar in Italy - the latter now ironically a Europcar brand) where I was ripped off for non-existent damage I didn't do. I have a global excess policy that I use everywhere from the US to Taiwan and Japan, as well as across Europe. But these two were the only times it's been triggered. To be fair, Europcar haven't ripped me off in this way. It's a credible brand. But customer service has not recovered from COVID and it seems it may well be time to move on."

The Newtown branch clearly can’t cope and really needs shutting down. Avoid at all costs!"

I gave two previous addresses but still ‘no’. I asked the desk clerk to phone her IT support team but ‘no - we can’t do that’. I asked to speak to the manager who was rude, surly and, after making no effort to resolve their issue with my booking or to provide me with a cancellation invoice to prove I had turned up, he dismissed me and returned to poking his computer. Email complaints to the customer service desk received fairly cursory, unhelpful replies. I never received an explanation- beyond ‘human error’ or any acceptance that their system was at fault. The desk staff have no ability to resolve issues. I luckily managed to get a car from SIXT at a similar price. NEVER BOOK WITH EUROPCAR - if something goes wrong, you are on your own."

Instead, they offered a Tesla and demanded an extra £30 per day for the upgrade during my 9-day rental.\n\nWhen I declined, they offered another vehicle for an additional £12 per day. Again, I refused, and they then claimed that no other vehicles were available and that I would need to wait 3–4 hours for a car to be returned.\n\nI had taken time off work and planned everything around this rental. After insisting firmly, they eventually gave me a car they had on-site — clearly proving that vehicles were available all along.\n\nThis company is clearly trying to upsell and exploit customers instead of honoring bookings. I had many options when booking, and I deeply regret choosing Europcar. They wasted over an hour of my time and caused unnecessary stress.\n\nIf the agreed vehicle is not available, you are supposed to upgrade the customer at no extra cost — not try to profit from the situation.

When we alerted the staff they brought out a booster seat for a 4 year old plus and before we could raise concerns the man literally ran off and we had to leave the car park due to other cars trying to leave and blocking up the car park.Them they said you agreed to pay the extra insurance which was flung on us at a busy desk with a queue of people in a foreign country!\nSo for our holiday for 8 days we had to drive with our daughter in a seat belt which is completely illegal and unsafe and restate the work unsafe !\nDue to this we didn’t drive 80 % of the holiday which we had planned to .\nAnd still when I rang up customer service about all this when home they just brushed off the safety of our child as we have no evidence of the car seat and there is nothing we could do…. Surely they had the 2 car seats in there depot so surely that would be evidence enough.\nThe fact that we paid money to Europacar pre booked our child seat and car and they didn’t have the safety equipment of the car seat to keep our child safe is outrageous.\nAnd then to be told we can not do anything about this is a sneaky and unsafe way to do business.\nI would like to see if I rented a car and child seat for one of their children and rush them out of the car park and see how they would feel.\nI would never use Europacar ever again unsafe unprofessional and sneaky aswell in the end .\nTake your money and provide an unsafe service disgusting."

From start to finish with company, I would go as far to say that they are the worst company of any company I have ever experienced.\nThe dashboard said there was a low tyre as I was leaving the depot, so I had a quick look and judged that none looked low to the eye, and just thought I’d keep an eye on it and pump it up myself to get it to the correct level. According to them, I should have checked all the tyres for screws and nails before leaving. Are you serious? I drove home and left it on the drive over night. In the morning it was nearly completely flat. I drove to a petrol station to pump it up noticed a screw in the tyre. I called them and was told to take it back to the depot. I did this, and I was told to take to Kwik Fit. I was also told it would be free as it wasn’t my fault. The apparently have no recollection of this.

No longer living in London I didn’t know this and received a penalty notice.\nI was surprised to receive it from Europcar week after my car was returned, but on realising it was my mistake I paid the notice and informed Europcar it had been settled. My complaint was that having paid the £65 fine promptly and thinking that was the end of the matter. Europcar then deducted another £45!! from my credit card to pay for their admin. I wrote to their customer services dept in case it was a mistake, as all they had to do was look up who was driving the car in question and send on an email informing them of the fine.\nIt would taken them 5-10 mins of their time to carry this out and for that they thought it was fair to charge £45 - which works out at an hourly rate of around £250-300p.h.\nWhen I pointed this out the customer services department were obstructive and extremely rude, repeating the same comment that’s it’s in the t&c’s I had signed on hiring the car.\nI tried to appeal against their argument but I kept receiving replies from the same 2 people who wouldn’t even listen to my point.\nI understand that they need to make a charge for admin but £45 - on top of a £65 penalty notice is really extreme.\nBut it’s their poor customer service and the way my complaint was dealt with …or should I say ignored, that means they have lost yet another previously loyal customer. I need to hire a car every 4-6 weeks so they have lost my custom along with a lot of other people from what I am now reading.\nSuch a shame they are so short-sighted.

(No car for hire at all, not just the car I had paid for). They are unable to give an immediate refund, for payment which was instantly taken for a service they cannot provide. Hundreds of pounds. It “might” take 10 days to receive a refund, could be longer, no one knows. Phone lines are not answered. In the meantime how can a person then afford to go hire another car? Made enquiries at their other office in the city, before realising they were not about to refund me, and they offered the same car type for twice the price. Walked the miles to the other depot, to find a damaged car which they would have been unable to hire to me anyway as the damage was so bad. Awful. Am needing to seek legal counsel to recoup money. I never write reviews, but this needs to be noted. This is the Stoke on Trent branches."

      "text": "Since the beginning of the rental, I have faced several problems with the vehicle. After going to the city of Porto (about half-an-hour from the airport) and parking the car, I realized that the doors did not lock with the remote control and that the car would not start. I contacted their helpline and was told that the vehicle would be towed and a taxi would be sent to take me to another Europcar counter.\n\nAbout an hour later, I arrived at the counter on Rua Gonçalo Cristóvão, where I had to wait another hour to be served due to the high number of people. I requested priority service, since the problem was Europcar's responsibility, but I was treated with indifference and a lack of professionalism by an employee, whose response was that I would have to wait the necessary time and that it was not her who caused the problem. I consider this attitude unacceptable and completely disrespectful.\n\nAfter finally delivering a second car to me, I continued on my journey. However, when I arrived at my destination, I realized, to my surprise, that the remote control of this new car did not lock the doors either. I was again forced to return to the same counter, where, after another wait, I was provided with a third car, without any apology.\n\nSince I picked up the first vehicle at 8:30 am, I spent about four hours without access to a working car, which means that I spent that time without enjoying the service I had already paid for. This lost time compromised important commitments that I had scheduled, namely a trip to the Citizens' Shop, which caused even more delays and inconvenience in the following days. All of this was made worse by the fact that I had been awake since 2am, having arrived in Porto at 7:30am on a flight.\n\nI have filed a claim 4 weeks ago and have received no reply yet. Very unprofessional"

      "text": "I wish to provide a candid warning to those contemplating the prospect of hiring from this company, particularly with regard to their Heathrow branch. This caution is underscored by a significant volume of negative reviews available online, and my experience is not isolated.\n\nDuring my interaction with the Heathrow location, I was subjected to charges exceeding £200, categorised as a Premium Station surcharge. This fee is levied despite the availability of other provincial alternatives within a reasonable taxi or cab fare of approximately £20. Furthermore, I was charged for Super Premium Personal Accident Cover, which is redundant as I possess my own comprehensive annual coverage with premiums totalling less than the cost of their two-week charge. Additionally, their breakdown cover was almost twice the cost of a standard RAC or AA annual policy for annual duration.\n\nRegrettably, I discovered these exorbitant charges only upon receipt of my invoice, as none of these fees were disclosed to me in advance. I strongly advise prospective customers to explore numerous online options for car hire excess cover provided by various insurers, which are available at a fraction of the costs imposed by this company. It is prudent to exercise caution; these charges are often hidden until after the transaction.\n\nMy attempts to rectify the situation were met with a lack of accountability. I engaged with a representative named Monica at a Spanish call centre, who assured me that the matter would be investigated. However, after a five-day interval, I was informed that no action had been taken, and I was told that Monica would face internal disciplinary measures.\n\nAlthough a decision was made to refund my charges, I was subsequently informed that the process would take five days due to the sum exceeding their operational limits, necessitating approval from the UK. This was further compounded by a call handler abruptly ending our conversation when I sought clarification, stating that they were restricted in the length of calls. Once approval was secured, I was told that an additional ten days would be required for the funds to reach my account.\n\nThis level of indifference displayed by their representatives is striking, particularly in light of how they would likely respond if the roles were reversed and they were in a similar predicament. My experience has been distressing, exacerbating my PTSD with multiple triggers stemming from their deceptive practices.\n\nI encourage anyone who has previously rented from this company to reassess their charges. Even years later, with the appropriate documentation, claims may be pursued in the County Court. To summarise:\n\n1. Avoid utilising the Heathrow location.\n2. Scrutinise all charges, regardless of the duration of your rental.\n3. Research supplementary services available from various providers online.\n4. Review competitor options thoroughly, paying particular attention to customer feedback.\n\nProtect yourself and make informed decisions."

Upon arriving at the rental desk, I was told that my reservation was \"blocked\" without any clear explanation, despite having a confirmed booking through Carflexi. I was then told I had no choice but to pay double the original price (for a new contract) for a different vehicle on the spot. Feeling pressured and stranded, I had no other choice than to comply.\n\nWhat followed was a series of deceitful and contradictory actions that made it clear this was not an isolated incident, but rather what felt like a systematic scam.\n\nThe agent handling my rental, someone named Sheikh, presented a false \"upgrade\" that I had never agreed to, and I was misled about what I was actually being charged for. It later turned out that I had been mistakenly identified as someone else with the same name, which Europcar themselves admitted in writing, confirming the error was entirely on their side.\n\nHowever, when I requested a refund for the extra charges caused by their own mistake, Europcar refused to accept any further responsibility. They effectively cut off communication and showed no willingness to resolve the issue, leaving me with no option but to escalate the case to the European Car Rental Conciliation Service (ECRCS).\n\nTo make matters worse, days after ECRCS confirmed I would be refunded £157 for the unjustified upgrade fee, Europcar attempted to charge my card an additional £142 without my consent. The only reason this unauthorized charge failed was because I had already transferred all remaining funds from that account, leaving no balance for them to take. I then had to urgently contact my bank and request the card be frozen to prevent any further attempts. This added yet more stress and time to an already exhausting situation.\n\nI have never in my life encountered a company that operates with such blatant disregard for honesty, accountability, and customer trust. I strongly urge others to avoid Europcar, especially at this location (London, Heathrow), unless you are prepared to be deceived, overcharged, and ignored when things go wrong."

In the past I haven’t added this cover and had no issues but this time the attendant was being really pushy and made me feel so uncomfortable that I added it anyway. He made very clear to me the only charges that will come out my account is the extra protection charge, the deposit, and the toll payer. I double checked with him because I already felt very ripped off paying over double what I booked the car at and he reassured me that was all the costs- nothing else would be taken from me. After I gave my car back I got an invoice with 2 extra charges that made the total 3 TIMES what I initially agreed on. My card was already set up from when I collected so they took the money. I emailed them a whole month ago and they refuse to get back to me to explain why I was lied to about costs.

I've sent pictures of the dashboard at time of pick-up and return that are time-stamped, clearly proving that I am right. I've sent a picture of the receipt showing I filled up with 20litres fuel - an ideal volume to have travelled 221 miles in a hybrid car! What more evidence do they need.

I was asked if I had used my card within the last half hour, which I hadn't and was then asked if I had made a payment of £1 to Europcar earlier. I was told that a payment of £2000+ had been made using my card and that it would seem it had been cloned. My money would be refunded and a new card issued but I needed to give more digits from my card. I realised this was a scam so hung up and contacted my bank. They were very concerned about the caller knowing about Europcar and asked me to contact Europcar which I did.

We booked our rental through Auto Europe, unaware at the time that they act as a broker and that the actual rental would be fulfilled by Europcar. Had we known this in advance and read the reviews, we would never have gone ahead with the booking.\n\nUpon arriving at Verona Airport, we eventually located the Europcar desk, and that’s when everything began to go wrong. The staff member at the desk was very insistent that we purchase additional insurance, despite the fact that we had already bought full protection through Auto Europe. Even after I phoned Auto Europe and they confirmed we were fully covered, the staff member continued to push the insurance, making us feel pressured and uncomfortable.\n\nWhen we were finally given the keys, we discovered that the car provided was completely different from what we had booked. We had reserved a VW Tiguan or similar SUV specifically to fit our passengers and luggage, but were given a saloon instead. I returned to the desk, where I was told that SUVs and saloons fall into the same category. I contacted Auto Europe again, and after speaking with the Europcar desk staff, they informed me that nothing could be done as Europcar uses a different classification system than Auto Europe.\n\nEventually, a more suitable car was located, but we were told we’d have to wait 30 minutes while it was cleaned. In reality, we waited far longer — not an ideal start to a long-awaited holiday.\n\nThe car we were eventually given wasn't in the greatest condition, but at least it could accommodate both our group and our luggage and done the job. Still, the overall experience was disorganised, frustrating, and disappointing.\n\nWe left feeling exhausted before our trip had even begun. Based on our experience, I cannot recommend Europcar or Auto Europe and would urge others to think twice before booking."

The car was damaged, dented and scratched from previous hiring that we highlighted to them when we picked it up. I'm sure all this damage had been previously claimed and paid but never repaired. Just complete scammers and insurance fraudsters!! Wilkl never use again!! Beware you will receive a claim! Probably even using old photos as claim and damage proof!!"

I returned it, with no damage to the car, gas tank full, and got a return receipt as proof of that. I had already paid for the hire and full insurance prior to arrival, so when I queried the additional large charge to my credit card when I arrived back home 2 week later, I discovered they had in fact charged me twice for the one car hire. It has been extremely stressful given why I was in the UK in the first place, but then to have this extra charge on my card, it has caused me no-end of stress. I made a complaint, raised a claim and have heard NOTHING from them. They owe me almost £400 and I have not had any response from their claims team. PLEASE DON'T USE THEM. Unfortunately I am now involving a solicitor which they will end up paying for. Such a simple solution could have been given, with all my paperwork and proof of overcharges, they just needed to refund me. I hate giving bad reviews, but this time it is 100% warranted."

My wife was traveling urgently to visit a critically ill family member and was emotionally vulnerable. Europcar staff seized the opportunity to pressure her into a vehicle upgrade she never asked for, slipping in a £142+ charge that she was never made aware of — all disguised beneath a rushed signature.\n\nLet me be clear: this was not a misunderstanding. This was exploitation. A predatory upsell tactic targeting someone in distress. And when we raised the issue, Europcar HQ responded with a robotic, tone-deaf statement dismissing it entirely — citing a \"signed document\" as though it excused the behavior.\n\nWorse still, the Cardiff Europcar branch reviewed the situation and told us clearly: 'this would never happen under our watch.' So yes — the Stansted team is acting on its own agenda and damaging the Europcar brand in the process.\n\nThis was manipulative, unethical, and cowardly. If this is how Europcar treats long-time customers and Privilege Members, they deserve every bit of reputational damage this review brings.\n\nWe are escalating this to senior management, Trading Standards, the Competition and Markets Authority, and the ECRCS.\n\nYou’ve lost our business permanently.\n\nJustin Wride\nEuropcar Privilege Member"

I spoke with the branch manager at Chelmsford where I rented the van from and requested a refund for the 2 additional gallons of fuel that I had put in their van.\n\nThe million dollar question is… are they carrying out sharp practice to fleece their customers or is it some skullduggery from an employee, either way it’s not right.\n\nBe warned make a note of the mileage and the average mpg used whilst in your rental.\n\nI have twice been on their website to complain, filled in all the questions, written a lengthy complaint and when I pushed the upload button it defaults to “there is an issue with our webpage” handy so I am left writing this review to vent my frustration…\n\nI have tried to contact customer services again as requested in their reply below and it still says there is a technical issue and it sends you back to the start again.

She repeatedly pressured me to accept unnecessary add-ons and even went so far as to suggest I’d likely end up in an accident for declining the additional insurance excess reduction. That kind of fearmongering is completely unacceptable. She asked the same intrusive questions multiple times — “How far are you going?” “When exactly are you bringing it back?” — in a tone that made me feel like I was begging to borrow her personal vehicle rather than paying to rent from a major company. The whole exchange was uncomfortable, condescending, and frankly, humiliating. At one point, I was so taken aback by her attitude, I genuinely considered walking away and telling her to keep the van. Renting a vehicle shouldn’t feel like being interrogated or talked down to. If this is how Europcar treats paying, polite customers — then count me out for good. I wouldn’t recommend this branch to anyone. Absolutely dreadful service."

We ended up paying €1000 for a basic 208 Peugeot which on their website was €300 when we initially paid for it. They also scammed us with €200 for a 3cm scuff on the wheel which was there before we rented the car, I showed the picture to them and the representative said I shouldn’t worry because it’s covered by the insurance (this was of course a lie) but they just need to record it for the next rental. They then also billed €87 for the damage admin fee. Be prepared to never see your deposit back and once you return the car if you don’t have a credit card then make sure you move the money from your account as they will just start charging random amounts to your debit card. Make sure you email all photos and videos and detailed description 1hr after you get the car as otherwise they won’t care what photos or videos you have. They lie, scam and steal and add secret charges that you didn’t ask for. We didn’t ask for roadside assistance and somehow it showed up on the invoice. There’s also a massive airport fee which they don’t tell you about in advance. Every price they say is without VAT, which they forget to mentioned. Do yourself a favour and find a local/family owned company outside of the airport and never go near Europcar as you will be robbed. Hopefully someone will eventually win a legal case against them."

He told me, however, that the car I reserved was not available and I was offered an upgrade for £9 a day extra for the 14-day rental period. I accepted this and the agent made out a rental agreement reflecting the upcharge. At no time did the agent in Southampton tell me that the payment we made through the 3rd party would be disregarded and that Europcar would be re-billing the entire rental amount again. However, 4 days after returning the car, Europcar charged my credit card the full rental price plus the upgrade charge. In other words, I ended up paying for the car twice.\nAfter calling the company’s customer service three times and explaining the situation by email, my complaint fell on deaf ears. I was finally told that the voucher I presented in Southampton and that the agent accepted and kept without comment had not been applied.\nTo add insult to injury, upon returning the car at the exact time and date stated on the rental agreement (as confirmed by the agent who received the car), I was charged for an extra day after being told the car should have been returned an hour earlier.\nApart from being conned out of more than $500, the worst part of this experience has been trying to communicate with a company that is completely deaf to their customers concerns. The customer service rep., who is located somewhere overseas, will let you talk about your problem endlessly and then do nothing about it. Ask to speak to a supervisor: ‘sorry there are none’. I have to assume that using bait and switch tactics to justify ignoring payments from third parties is a common Europcar practice in order to avoid paying fees to those parties.\nSince we still needed an additional rental in the UK, we discovered Drivalia, which came highly recommended. It is understandable because their rates are half of what Europcar charges and their customer service reps are extremely friendly and accommodating.\nHopefully, my own experience with Europcar’s unethical business practices will serve as a caution to anyone in future looking to do business with an ethical car rental company.\n\nReview update: In response to Europcar's standard corporate response.\nWe had already contacted Europcar 4 times by phone and email, detailing the complaint. They have either not bothered responding at all or on one occasion were completely dismissive.\nThe attempt by Europcar to act like they care now is nothing more than a laughable PR stunt."

The other depots both said we should not have been charged more for the car and they hadn't heard of any luggage laws as told to us.\n1. We asked the guy in Edinburgh to try our luggage in the car we hired but he refused. He told us there were restrictions on putting luggage on the rear seat (a small carry on bag) He also told us the police were on the lookout for hire cars doing this on the North Coast 500, not knowing the laws we believed him. But I haven't seen any corroboration on the internet to say this is true.\n2. We went to Inverness to swap our car as instructed by Europcar's head office via email.\n3. Inverness advised us he had not heard from head office and advised us to keep going as smaller cars are like hens teeth. What did they expect us to do? We had already paid $1900aus and had pre booked accommodation.\n4. We only signed because we had to have something because we were booked ahead.\n5. At no time after we went to Inverness depot were we instructed to go back for a smaller car which we would have done. So why were we instructed to go to Inverness only to find no car available, and why weren't we told to come back the next day or at some other time...were we expected to walk around Scotland??\nAll of the above borders on a shonky deal and we have been trying to resolve this since April 24th....how long does it take.\nThe contract was signed after we assumed the story we were told was true but since found out it was dubious at best so....if you sign a contract under wrong assumptions it should be voided. Was the initial amount we paid not considered?\nThe car had lollies and other packets in the glove box...the guy in Edinburgh said we might have to fill up with Adblue which we had to do on the first fill of the tank....this should be done by Europcar not the customer...there was no manual in the car so we could not learn anything about how the controls worked. We would never recommend Europcar to anyone, quite the opposite especially when we have been fobbed off with the phrase \"but you signed the contract\" so even though we were told a story to get us into a bigger car which we didn't want and didn't order it doesn't matter to Europcar?\nWe booked a Citroen C3 or similar and we would have easily fit our luggage in that sized car. When we took the car back to Manchester Trafford Park the man who took delivery of the car was called Usama and he told us we should not have to put Adblue in the car as it's Europcar's job to do it...he said the guy in Edinburgh might have lied to get a bigger bonus...he said we would be reimbursed for the Adblue and the bond money both of which we are yet to see.\nThanks,\nPeter Brock"

The car is filthy to the point the cloth I used was black after wiping down all the interior. The carpets are full of crumbs, dirt and stains which look like blobs of sick 🥴 It also smells horrible it’s a 74 plate MG which is the same year as my car with just over 10,000 miles for a car to smell the way this does you’d think it was 12 years old and never cleaned. For someone that’s on a mobility scheme for my child & have my child in this filthy was just not a option I will be cleaning it for my use only but I will not be returning it immaculate as this is not the condition it was delivered in very disappointed and haven taken pictures as proof."

Quick to pick up the car, great to bring it back, everything speedy...\n\nHowever.... not being a local and not having driven loads in the UK roads, it can be extremely hard to avoid getting an automatic fine. I went into a bus lane on a Monday (bank holiday though) on an empty road, at a junction that is designed so you will unavoidably touch the bus lane if you are not laser focused on the markings on the road. A very scammy, tricky place to get a fine.\n\nI get the fine on my email. £35. Angry but i said ok, better luck next time. Then i see that Europcar thinks its ok to add a £45 'administration' fee, as if they have to do anything time consuming, other than send an email.\n\nSo they want MORE than the fine because what you can do? Its in the booklong terms and conditions.\n\nFear not, i will pay you this administration fee but you WILL NEVER SEE ME AGAIN as a customer.\n\nI took great care to be careful with the car and return it in great shape, i was on time and i get 'fined' with nothing, so you can pocket easy money?

I never requested roadside assistance or personal protection but these were added to invoice. This is a scam where they make these additions part of your deposit. It is basically theft.\n\nCustomer services have now told me that cannot do anything as they were not part of verbal conservation at location - they have said that I should have been offered extras and asked to accept or decline which never happened.\n\nSo basically buyer should be aware of this practice and scrutinise what you are signing up for and make sure no extras have been added surreptitiously\n\nI would also beware of premium location surcharge that is added to costs.\nI certainly will not hire from them again."

      "text": "Edit 26 May: It is impossible to get hold of anyone on the phone or via email. It all looks professional but there is ZERO customer service. Do not go near this company.\n\nFor a 6 day hire my bill so far is gbp 400 plus deposit. I feel totally ripped off. I have not been able to drive the car because a tyre had 2 holes in it and no one was interested in resolving the problem. I have been stuck in one place waiting for repairs to be done. There was no spare tyre.\nI went through Rentalcar.com which is a broker. I was in a difficult situation and had to hire in a hurry for a next day, Saturday, start. I requested a Leeds city pick up and Manchester airport drop off on Thursday. I was charged 233gbp, then 85gbp extra when I went to pick up the car because the ‘different drop off location’ had ‘dropped off’. Plus a deposit which was ok and expected, if large. There was another extra charge for road usage when I picked up the vehicle. Prices are advertised in GBP but my UK credit card was charged in NZ dollars - I’m using an NZ mobile phone and drivers license but there was no obvious option to change the currency quoted/charged in. So then the insurance cover was added - the wording strongly suggests you need their full insurance offer. This was £65 for 6 days. Charging my UK credit card in NZ$ incurred four times unnecessary conversion fees. By now I’m committed and don’t have time (or energy because I’m dealing with a family emergency and really need a good reliable car, right now) to find another supplier so accepted the deal.\nI booked a 10am pick up. There was a 15’ wait before being able to begin completing the paperwork and pick up the car. The car itself is ungroomed in the interior, and didn’t drive well from the get go. Shortly after leaving the pick up point an alarm appeared saying ‘tyre pressure low’. I did not have time to deal with this immediately. When I called Europcar (the end supplier) two days later, by which time the wheel alignment feels obviously wrong, I waited a very long time for an answer and was eventually shunted through to someone who turned out to be the AA who came out to check the car through their breakdown service. Whilst the AA is always great, I could have called them on my own membership and saved the 30 minutes + waiting for Europcar to answer. So at this point I had no usable car (for which I’ve paid a very expensive total hire rate) and was stuck waiting for a roadside rescue service to help me out with ‘my’ problem. The AA turned up as promised an hour later, removed a nail ‘which has been in there a long time’, did a temporary fix so I could get to some local appointments early the next day (having by now not been able to get to that day’s necessary hospital visit and run other urgent medical-related errands), and booked a new tyre service Kwikfit who replaced the tyre the next day. They found another nail in the tyre and let slip that poor quality tyres on loaned-out vehicles are a common problem with Europcar vehicles. The worst part of this is that Europcar do not answer the phone and even when they do couldn’t give a damn. When I did eventually get through to a customer service agent she was smugly rude by just meeting my concerns with deliberate silence. She finally put me through to ‘the local branch’ (an ad loop telling lies about how great Europcar is) which clearly no one answers) where I was on hold over 30’ before I gave up. Worst customer experience ever. Will never use rentalcar.com or Europcar ever again."

The 'solution', after much wrangling was a drop off at our hotel, incurring huge drop off fees which they failed to tell us about, but they already had our credit card details, so they just took the money without telling us). The result was we payed over £300 for a 3 day hire, which we had NOT signed up for. I got a generic response to my review (that looked good on the review page) - 'we're so sorry etc, contact customer services on this phone number (didn't work) or this email (bounced back) or via our website (hooked into a loop that there is no response to). So I am admitting defeat and am going to sign it off as a really bad customer experience in which I was cheated by Europcar.\nBut as there is no option to respond to their 'helpful' response, I am leaving another review here.

This staff, who is on duty, confirmed he could wait up to 30 minutes beyond the usual closing time – until 11:30 PM. We expressed our deep appreciation in phone.\nBefore making the car booking, we contacted your Customer Service team to clarify what would happen in the event of a flight delay, given that your office hours end at 11:00 PM. We were assured that, as long as we provided our flight number, your staff would monitor our arrival and wait for us accordingly. Based on this reassurance, we proceeded with the booking and submitted our flight information\nWe explained our situation and referenced the prior conversation with that staff. However, he remained adamant. When we requested an official policy document justifying this charge, he became defensive, accused us of being impolite, and refused to provide any documentation. He then stated that unless we paid the fee, he would close the office and WITHOUHOLD the car.\nAdding to our discomfort, before demanding the late fee, this staff spent over five minutes trying to upsell us additional insurance. We informed him that we had already purchased full coverage. He replied confidently—but misleadingly—that full coverage did not include wheels and tires, and pressured us to purchase more coverage. When we declined, his attitude changed abruptly, and he immediately brought up the “After Hours” charge.\nLastly, when we arrived at 11:04 PM, the staff member had just finished completing the documentation for the previous customer. He was not simply waiting in the office for serving us.\nI fully agree that flight delay was not Europcar’s fault and was not their responsible for this either.\nHowever, they did not keep promise and still charged us after failing to sell us insurance, simply because we were only 4 minutes late.\nThey not only refused to issue a refund, but also failed to provide any documentation justifying the 'late charge' as per their Terms and Conditions\nPlease think carefully before ordering a car from them, even if their initial prices seem cheaper."

It took about 40 days to fix my car so during this time I did about 2,000 miles. When finally my car was ready, I was told that I can leave the rental at the repair garage, as this was apparently, the usual practice. It took Europcar 3 days to collect their car and I received the collection report with all the images, which looked okay. I've been driving for more than 40 years, dozens of different rental cars around the world, never had a damage. I did not suspect any problems with the rental car, as usual.\nWhat was my surprise when a month later I got a message from Europcar stating there was damage to the rental car worth nearly a £1,000! There was no visible damage to the car while in my possession and I am not aware of anything like that! The images presented were magnified x20, making minor scuffs and scratches look massive. The car was not at the place where I left it, and was also cleaned. There was no mention in the contract that 2mm scuffs will be considered a damage worth £1,000!\nI feel so sorry I accepted their service as they are clearly after ripping off their customers. The car was not even repaired, it was rented again to other people, and the damage claimed is barely noticeable. They took advantage of me as I was so stressed by the accident I had. Europcar made me sign documents I was not in a proper state to thoroughly read, made me agree to a huge excess (£1,000, no coincidence?), they even claimed a damage described in their paperwork upon vehicle delivery.\nI would strongly recommend - DO NOT use Europcar! They would only try to rip you off as much as they can! I wish I never had to use their lousy service and will, most definitely, avoid Europcar from now on. Europcar is an absolute disgrace!"

Otherwise they will try to take you for all you’re worth.\n\nThat’s without even mentioning the lack of care, they are supposed to come out and show you the car’s features, how to use it, etc.\nMine was an EV which I had never used before, he just gave me the keys and sent me on my way.\n\nOverall extremely negative experience."

      "text": "Avoid at all costs!\n\nMy insurance company gave me a rental car from Europcar for a week in September 2024. Everything went smooth and handed back the car with no issues. After 7 months my insurance company had called me saying that Europcar have put a claim through mentioning there is a chip on the windscreen! They blamed me for it after 7 months which surely doesn’t make sense! You have customers all the time using your vehicle so how can they accuse me for it? They didn’t call me or send me anything and next thing you know I have been charged £619.89 on my credit card out of nowhere without consent. No mention from them for this charge at all. This is fraud!!!! Avoid these scammers! I have called them up and they just mention they have put a dispute in. 1 week later no call back nothing. They have stolen my money!"

But that if we wanted we could take an upgraded car that was ready to go for £20.\nGiven that I had 2 young children (4 and 1) with me and we’d been on a long flight, I didn’t want to wait an indefinite length of time for the car I’d booked to be ready, so I said I would pay £20 in order to take the car that was ready and leave the airport.\n\nIt was only once my card was charged that I double checked the contract and had been charged £20 PER DAY. Had this been clearly explained there is no way I would have paid £200 to leave the airport 20 minutes early. The upgrade was not sold honestly and I have been left feeling tricked by what is meant to be a reputable company.\nWould definitely not recommend and be very careful in trusting any information given to you in person\n\nAlso, please do not reply saying to raise an issue on the link as you have with the negative reviews of other people, I already submitted a complaint using this process on 28 April and have received no response 10 days later"

      "text": "So unbelievably bad it's shocking. My first experience with them was a year or so ago when I booked a van to move house. They cancelled the night before and ruined everything. Unfortunately I had forgotten this when I booked a car for a weekend away recently. I thought I had paid for everything online (about £200 for 4 days I think) only to be charge over £150 more when I got to the airport (Manchester). I was also told they were offering a \"deal\" on an upgrade to an automatic - they told me the *upgrade* was an extra £100/day usually but that they'd reduced it to £40 as an offer. Not only am I fairly sure this was a lie (it's not £100/per day more online), the *per day* part was said very quietly. Then they gave me an automatic anyway! A few weeks later I got an admin fee of £45. I believe it easily cost more than double what Avis would have charged (I have used them before and they were honest and transparent and I highly recommend them). This felt like a scam. I'm still angry over a month later."

      "text": "We had booked a 9-seater Mercedes van on line for a short holiday in Spain. Arrived at Malaga Airport on 5th April. We thought it would be quick service to get our vehicle. Were made to wait an unreasonable amount of time while the staff struggled to locate a Mercedes vehicle. After some delay, the customer service agent remarked, “At last, I’ve found the Mercedes van for you,” and then immediately pushed a rental agreement towards me for signature.\nThis document listed more than half a dozen scratches, broken parts, and damages — yet none of this was explained or reviewed with me in any way. Most of the text appeared to be in Spanish, with only a few vague English notes.\nAfter waiting for over 30 minutes at the desk, we were handed the keys and told to collect the vehicle from level -2 of the car park. Not only was this an inconvenient distance from the desk, but the underground storage was extremely poorly lit — making it nearly impossible to conduct a proper inspection of the car.\n\nWe were told to report any additional damage within 24 hours or risk being held liable for anything not listed. Due to the lighting conditions, we were unable to thoroughly inspect the vehicle. We drove it out and parked at a nearby shopping centre, where we finally had a chance to properly look over it. What we discovered was shocking: the vehicle had over two dozen scratches on the bodywork and extensive internal damage, including loose parts that rattled loudly during the short drive. It was very clear that this vehicle was not roadworthy and should never have been released for rental.\nHave already complained (22966365). No explanation has been provided in response to my formal complaint, which I find unacceptable. This response lacks the seriousness the matter deserves and reflects poorly on how Europcar treats its customers.\nDon't rent a car through Europcar at Malaga airport. Their cars are parked too far underground, and you cannot inspect the vehicle because of poor lighting. Avis or other cars are parked at a reasonable distance. The message is clear - AVOID Europcar. They only want your money by even putting your life at risk"

I am currently trying to retrieve over £1100 that Europcar took out of my account on a saturday morning without any authorisation and having never had a hire car from them. I tried to get a hire the previous month for work for 30 days. I entered everything for them and paid in full before going to collect the car from Manchester airport. When I got there the very aggressive and uninterested staff informed me that they were going to do a credit check on my address. I was not worried as I own my own house lived there for years and don't do credit or debt. The guy comes back and refuses me the car hire. I'm like hang on this can't be right. Also why was this check not done before I'd paid my money. The staff refused to help me I any way and would not allow me to speak to a more senior member of staff. There message to me was go somewhere else you are not getting anything from us today. I was left standing there having giving up the day to collect the car in the first place. I was informed that it would take 20 days to get my money back. Europcar held my money in their account making interest for days before I eventually got it back. No car and no money for 10 days. I launched an investigation to find out why my address had an issue only to find out that the poorly educated and extremely rude member of staff had entered next doors address. I feel he did it on purpose. These guys were a real bad bunch at Manchester Airport Branch. On the 28th April for no reason Europcar took from my account the money again. I have still nor had it back. There is no one to complain to at Europcar there is no real customer service to speak off. These accessed my personal data withdraw money from my account and have held onto it. I have had to register it as a theft with he police I've had to buy a vehicle in order to start my new job at the cost of £8000 taxed and insured lost days in work as a result of it. I don't think I've ever been so badly treated by a company in my life. I actually thought that this type of behaviour by a company was not possible in this day and age but it is. Don't be fooled by this company with the green t-shirt and little euro logo this guys are scam artists and should not be trading at all. I will be bring to the whole thing to trading standards and data protection etc. I never take the time to write reviews but I am writing this to try and save others from being scared like I was. Please stay away from these guys especially at the Manchester Airport branch."

We had never hired a vehicle before & could almost see ££s signs in the rep's eyes when he asked us. My husband did ask if the car we had booked had a Sat Nav system (Ford Focus or similar booked via Booking.com) & were told that only new electric cars had these. He then went into back office & bought out 2 sets of keys for a Hyundai Kona & a Volvo car - no sign of our original request!! After being bombarded with insurance information & other additional charges told that the insurance already taken out with Booking.com was useless, so told to take out their additional insurance - even charged more for the One-Way charge than anticipated - altogether had to pay an additional £400 for a car we didn't request or need!!! We weren't even shown to the car or shown around the vehicle to check for any damage & it was getting dark by the time we finished with the reams of paperwork. We didn't even know how to start the car initially & had to figure out how to operate the Sat Nav ourselves! The final figure on the Rental Agreement was deducted from my husband's bank account but then adjusted after leaving the Desk. All in all - a totally traumatic experience, which was unexpected & we left shell-shocked. I think the staff are trained to confuse customers into signing up for additional services that they do not want or need. I think that they make customers feel cheap & uneducated if they question the explanation for additional services. I wouldn't recommend this company to my worst enemy. I contacted Booking.com with these details and think they are aware of their practices as they refunded the insurance that I took with them without any questions & advised that the deposit (which we didn't know would be deducted either) would be returned within 28 days but not much else. PLEASE DO NOT HIRE VEHICLES FROM THEM - we will never ever use them."

I paid nearly £80 for the pleasure, along with a £100 deposit and £36 insurance upgrade. The collection process was simple and straight forward, and the bloke who helped me was nice. However, I was told I would need to leave the van in a nearby carpark when I was done with it, as there was no where else to leave it out of hours, but that it would be picked up at 1pm on the Sunday (the following day). Fair enough, although it would have been useful to know this upon booking. I dropped the van off 3 hours before my rental period ended at 7pm on the Saturday, and paid for the parking until the next day (as advised by the staff member) for 12 hours at nearly £8. I received a return statement and invoice on the Monday to say that I was being charged an additional £114.45 as I didn’t hand the car back until the Monday! I contacted customer via phone and email, and sent proof of my drop off, the carpark receipt and all additional info I had to and they essentially fobbed me off and told me it was my fault and that I had indeed dropped the car off on the Monday. They explicitly said I had been charged correctly. They then stopped replying to my emails. I phoned the branch where I hired the van from and they accepted that they had wrongly charged me BUT it took almost 4 weeks to get my money back, and in total I spoke to 6 different people who were useless at helping me. I kept being told ‘it should be with you soon, call back in 2 days’. Overall, a horrific service and unless you push and press them, they are reluctant to accept fault and refund you. I didn’t get one apology during this experience. DO NOT USE THEM."

      "text": "Update: it is funny how quickly you get a reaction when you make a public complaint compared to zero response to several e-mails and filled forms like the one proposed in the reaction of Europcar. I will try once again but have no issues of getting a reply or solution from Europcar.\n\n---\n\nI booked the car through Easyjet and (in short) this happened at the Europacar desk in Gatwick:\n\n- When picking up the car the person behind the desk tried to upsell. She had 2 keys, one of the MG which would be our car and another key of a car which would have navigation and heated seats. Normally for 100 pound extra, but now only for 40. We declined this and the MG had navigation and heated seats anyway. Seems like very dodgy practice.\n\n- I had to sign a document, I asked what is was for,, the person said I was signing for the car not having any damage. She even joked it felt like “siding your life away”. The car didn’t have any damage but it seems she lied about what I was signing.\n\n- After that I had to swipe my card. I asked if this was for the deposit. She said, yes this is for deposit, this again seems like a blatend lie as my creditcard was charged anyway after returning the car.\n\nGetting a reply from the client service department is a real nightmare. I have send about 6 e-mails (one every week) to get a reply of 2 sentences by someone who clearly didn't care to read buy e-mails or check my case. Renting with Europcar has been an absolute disaster and I wil never do so again.\n\nI have bookked many cars with other rental companies all around the world and I never had any problems. Of course I wouldn't recommend anybody to book with Europcar."

      "text": "ok, I knew this is a waste of time, but I called customer service again, and I talked to Leo (Ipad) again. What are the odds?\nAt least this time he was honest and told me that there's nothing I can do and they reached out to me on trust pilot just so they look that they are trying.\nBig surprise there...\nWow, this company is rotten to the core.\n\nOn April 10th we flew to Heathrow, and we took a shuttle to Europcar to pick up the car we already paid for online.\nThe guy at the desk started to push a free upgrade, a Mercedes GLE SUV. I said I don’t want it because it is an expensive car, but he insisted, saying that the car is not new and has scratches.\nEventually we agreed and he said there’s a deposit of 284 GBP that will be refunded when we return the car.\nThat’s when he realized that my wife’s driver’s license is expired, but because he was eager to scam us he finished the papers making her the main driver which should be not only against their policies but also illegal. Of course she didn’t drive at all, I was doing all the driving.\nI signed the papers and then he said that because it is a free upgrade a manager will have to sign.\nThe manager came and he signed then we left. What I didn’t realize was that the manage added a 4 in front of 284 making it 4284 GBP.\nAlso, we didn’t realize until later that they didn’t take any deposit from the visa (for the obvious reasons).\n\nWhen we returned the car, we noticed the amount on the back, and we asked to speak to the manager (a different one).\nHe was right in front of us, but we had to wait about 20 minutes because he was trying to push an upgrade to a family.\nEventually we talked to him and he said that it is our fault for signing and he pretty much called me stupid.\nWe tried to lock the Visa, but it was too late.\n\nWe returned to Canada and immediately called Europcar customer Service and talked to Agostina.\nI explained the situation including the expired license. She gave us a case number and said she will e-mail us with a resolution.\nAfter couple of hours we got and e-mail for her saying that our request was respectfully denied.\nI called again and talked to Leo. I explained to him the situation again, stressing the fact that the contract should be void because\nit was issued knowing that the main driver’s license is expired. He agreed and said that maybe Agostina overlooked that aspect.\nHe gave me a new case number and said he will e-mail us within a day.\nThe next day we got the e-mail, and he respectfully denied the refund saying “even in the case Mrs Bogatan would not have a\nValid driving license she would remain the legal hirer as it is her who signed the agreement and paid”. That is incorrect\nbecause it was me who signed and paid the agreement.\n\nAt no point in our conversation Leo or Agostina seemed surprised that someone would spend 4284 GBP on an upgrade\nfor a rental that costed about 350 GBP which makes it obvious that everybody there is part of a big happy bunch f scammers that is Europcar.\nWe checked online and there is an overwhelming number of negative reviews, lots of them describing situations similar to ours.\nI guess I should consider myself lucky for not damaging the car, because apparently that is Europcar’s main way to overcharge customers.\n\nThe question is how can big company like this openly rob so may customers without any actions from the authorities?\n\nDan Bogatan"

I have just had money taken out of my account almost 2 months after the hire for an undisclosed reason , my communications and phone calls resulted in them basically telling me it’s not their problem and for me to deal with it so Europcar are saying it’s not Europcars problem you need to speak to Europcar.

They are sending Dart Charge invoices after returning the car and charge 9x (!) the amount we needed to pay to Dart Charge. We just talked to a customer rep from Dart Charge and he told us that they did not receive any payments from Europcar even though we already transferred it. On top of that, it would only have to be £5 in total instead of £45, which we’ve been charged by Europcar, which they must have kept! This company is absolutely not trustworthy, we have not even been informed about any additional charges that should be expected! Choose any other car rental provider, but stay away from Europcar!"

      "text": "I hired a large van to move some items all in all around 30miles. I needed it on a Saturday and this was the only company with availability. I booked it on the Thursday beforehand. Booked the van from 10:00am-22:00pm on Saturday and was charged £71.45 which I thought was fairly reasonable. Noticed when booking that a charge would be added after as I would be returning the van out of hours. I called Europcar to ask how much this charge would be and was told £20. I asked for this info to be emailed to me in case they tried to charge more later. They said they couldn't provide this info in writing which made me nervous but I needed to go ahead with the booking. The next day (Friday) I had a phone call from them saying that the van I had booked was not available but they could offer me a smaller one. I declined as had to move a sofa. They said it was OK and they would make sure the van was available for my booking the next day. Saturday we arrived at Europcar at 10am but there was nowhere to park at all - it was a tiny site with cars/vans everywhere. I ended up dropping off my partner and parking at the shop down the street. He was waiting for about 15 minutes till he got served and was told the van wasn't ready. He had already checked in online but they wanted all of his details again. Clearly they needed to waste time as the van wasn't ready. They asked for the payment card so I had to go back and provide this, they made a comment to my partner saying something along the lines of 'we will cancel this whole thing off until she gets here and then start again' - my partner said 'no that is not necessary she is parked 30 seconds away - keep it on the screen she will be here now'. I arrived and they took all of my details and tried to sell me insurance. I said that the basic will be fine as we are travelling very local. They proceeded to try and scaremonger me into taking the insurance but I said no. At this point it was about 11am and they were cleaning the van. I said that I want a discount as the van wasn't ready 1 hour after my booking time. They said as a gesture of goodwill that I could have the van until the following day. I said this is no use to me, I am doing 1 trip - I want you to waive the £20 key drop-off out of hours fee and they said they would 'try'. So far, I haven't been charged this but wouldn't be surprised if it comes out of my account in the next few days. Would not recommend at all. Problem at every stage. Should have read reviews before booking. Even if you're in dire need I would go elsewhere."

Approached the counter, asked if there were any issues and was assured by James that this isn't a problem - that there won't be any additional charges for the early pick up, and the original reservation will hold (i.e. able to return at the original time without incurring any late fees as well).\n\nI had added on the fuel option and was told that there'd be a hold on my card for excess fees, which will be returned. Went through the contract quickly, and James only pointed out the additional fuel option and got me to sign. BIG MISTAKE. I should've noticed that the contract now showed an additional day's rental charged at a ridiculously high rate, along with associated fees.\n\nFor context, my original booking was a compact sedan over 3 days, and the spot rate charged for what was essentially a 45-minute early pick up was £100 (40% of my initial cost). Might I add that due to the hard selling, we only received the key to the car 20 minutes before the original pick up time.\n\nAfter returning the car, I wasn't provided a statement of return nor a final invoice, despite them responding to confirm that it would be sent over in the next 10-20 minutes. When I saw the absurd charges to my card a few days later, Europcar representatives informed me that the dispute was filed, but again, they never got back with a case number and went radio silent after.\n\nDespite 2 follow-up emails, sharing the intention to file for a chargeback based on fraud, Europcar refused to respond. Filed for a dispute with my bank, took months and multiple emails before I finally got my money back.\n\nSave your time and wallet, pay the extra and go with more reputable car rental firms in Bristol."

We paid for a LUTON van to move house, a week before they phoned to say it wasn’t available and we’d need to downsize but that the capacity was similar. Begrudgingly we said yes. They then phone to say we need to repay for the hire of that van?! Despite already having 170£ for the original hire (assured this will be refunded within 10 days), we then pay out AGAIN for a second van. You guessed it the day before completion they phoned to say we don’t have that van now, unless we want to wait until 5pm?! Erm no. So we downsize yet again to what can only be described as a large car, we refuse to pay again but are then asked to pay a whopping deposit despite them already having 2x van payments from us. The customer service was beyond shocking, people have the communication skills of a wet lettuce, and that’s putting it nicely. You ask at the desk and are met with blank faces and “we don’t know how to do that”. Honestly shocking from start to finish and 300£ lighter."

Before booking the car I was assured by two Europcar employees what the price was and was promised that the extra number on the paper was my deposit that I would get back. They then took the extra money out of my account and when I raised this with Customer Care they said they would speak to the Park Royal branch I rented the car from, but they never did - just fobbed me off with an email saying the case was being dismissed. I then had to go back to the branch and speak to them in person. It took 3 months of my life to finally get the money back only to then receive an email from Europcar's lawyers fining me for not paying a bill that I had in fact already paid. They also charged me for a full tank of petrol when I returned the car despite the fact that I returned it full. It seems that Europcar took money from me at every chance they had. If I hadn't spent the time sorting this I would be several hundreds of pounds out of pocket. This has caused me so much stress! What a nightmare company to deal with."

I then received a damage notification followed by a £100 bill for a 'light scuff' on one wheel, (which wasn't caused by me). I was shown no proof that this was not there before my rental and as much as I did check the car for dents/scrapes on the doors, bumpers etc (Bearing in mind it was dark at almost 11pm at night when I collected the car), I did not get down on my hands and knees with a torch to check the car tyres, if I had done I would have seen that this 'light scuff' was already there. At the time of returning the car I signed the tablet with no mention of any damage by staff even after they had walked around and inspected the car.\nI contacted customer services and was simply told that 'any damage needed to have been reported before hand'.

When I arrived I was told that I was on a watchlist in the uk and couldn’t hire the car, after a 26 hour flight. I was in disbelief as I’d never hired a car off of you. I asked the desk colleague to investigate who said there was nothing he could do as it was a uk issue. I then had to hire a different car which wasn’t fit for purpose from another company, I needed a truck one way from Nelson to Queenstown as was moving Items.I then had to stay up till it was 9am back in the uk (10pm nz time) to sort out myself, jet lagged as hell. You then admitted it was your mistake and I could now go and pick up the truck, I drove back 2 hours to the airport to swap the cars. I’d had to pay for a full weeks hire of the car I didn’t need and the other car company wouldn’t refund me, I’d need to obtain a refund from Europcar for the £700 I was now out of pocket. I then sent an email to the relevant department after speaking to one of your call centres and you replied saying I’m still blocklisted and you can’t issue a refund! I then have tried calling 4 times to your call centres (in India not the UK) who when I ask to speak to a manger to escalate have hung up on me 4 times. I’ve never experienced such poor customer service. All I wanted initially was my refund for the car I had to hire because of your ineptitude, however I will now be taking you to small claims court and claiming for the car, my time, and the stress you have caused me, along with the interest on the money you owe me. DO NOT hire from this company, they are absolutely useless, the departments don’t speak to each other and no one in any department has the authority to make a decision when something goes wrong, I suspect the staff don’t get paid well enough to care about their jobs or to provide any worthwhile level of service.

Apparently there is no other medium van available.\nI phone customer services and ask to be put through to the complaints department but all they can do is log that I have complained. They can't sort it out. So they transfer me back to customer services who explain to me that when you book via the website and even though you receive 2 emails confirming your booking, it doesn't mean that the booking is actually confirmied. It is just noting what you would like. All they can suggest is that I try to book a van from another location. I suggest that if there is a van at another location, it could be delivered to Tamworth for tomorrow. Apparently that can't be done. They did offer to cancel my booking free of charge but that doesn't help me with my need for a medium size van in 20 hours time.\nIn the end they suggest that I ring Tamworth and ask them to sort it out, which obviously Tamworth can't do because otherwise they wouldn't have rung me in the first place.\nUPDATE\nAs readers can see I got a response from Europcar some time between 5-6.00pm so I followed their instructions and tried to email them with further information.

However, Europcar tried to upsell me their insurance - even though when you do manage to read through DiscoverCars policy - it says you are covered. But Europcar then ask you to fully cover the car with a credit card - in my case, 1800Euros which if you don't have a credit card it's more on a debit card- around another 25euros a day. It was exhausting - the operative at Europcar also said she had never heard of DiscoverCars - even though the bus was outside with both their logos on and if you Google them - they say they are partners! I ended up having to get a cab. The whole thing exhausting and leaves you feeling like fresh meat to be plundered!"

This is despite there being a big sign in the car and a written policy of no smoking in the cars. I had to accept the vehicle given the lack of alternatives and the need to be on my way quickly but mentioned it on return and it was treated as a non complaint. A totally couldn’t care a less attitude. I then complained to the company in writing and they didn’t even acknowledge the complaint. I wrote to them about an unexpected charge along with the smell complaint and they acted like I hadn’t even mentioned the smell aspect. They also wrote off my complaint about the unexpected charge. Despite repeated attempts to have the smell aspect acknowledged they refused and pointed me to an industry complaints organisation. Ridiculous and disgraceful as well as lazy not only in valeting the vehicle but in the sense of not dealing with a normal complaint and instead forcing the customer to deal with a different body. This displays traits that show this company has no desire towards customer service, is willing to pass on substandard vehicles and charge for the privilege. My advise, go elsewhere. Anywhere else."

During the hire, the car developed a tyre issue and we had to wait a long time for it to be repaired, leaving us unable to use the vehicle for a period of time.\n\nWe also spent far too long on the phone to customer service, who gave different information and weren’t particularly helpful throughout.\n\nAt the end of the month-long hire, we were charged £201 for a valet – due to dust, gravel in the footwells (it was winter). The rest of the car was spotless, and even one of their own advisors agreed the charge seemed excessive. To top it off, it took 4 months for them to tell us the price they wanted to charge.\n\nI’ve used plenty of other car hire companies without issue – this was by far the most frustrating experience. I won’t be using Europcar ever again."

I recently went to Gatwick Airport to hire a car for the weekend, and the price of £408 for just two days has completely turned me off from this company for life. This experience has become a topic of conversation among my colleagues, friends, and family. I'm sorry, Europcar, but your time in the market is up; this situation is outrageous!\n\nIt seems like either the employees are making money on the side for their personal gain, or the company is poorly managed. Their advertisement claims that you can hire a car from £40 per day, but when I inquired, they were quoting me £200 per day instead! This feels like false advertising, and they are clearly breaking laws left and right.\n\nAdvisory is if they mess up the best thing is to open a complaint and conduct an ADR process, wait for their final response, and then to Financial Ombudsman Services, which is a free service. Once you have a ruling in your favor, this is the key for charges to be added. One colleague was ready to sue this firm for £8,000 when initially Europcar only owed £2,500 for falsely extorting monies for their personal gain, which is fraud under the 2006 Act. They had to pay very quickly; otherwise, their stock of cars would go to auction with more costs to them! And then see them in court with your decision from the FOS and then send in bailiffs to collect your debt! Easy way but will take time. Theur customer services are incompetent to deal with complaints so court is the best action."

This third party admitted responsibility and I filed a damage report following Europcars instructions. They had all the details of the driver causing the damage and I assumed that was the end of the issue. However, sometime later I received a claim for payment of the damage from Europcar. I explained the situation but they had no record of my damage report. The alarm bells should have started ringing then. I had to pay the 850 pounds damages, while they claimed the money from the driver responsible and I have still not been refunded some 8 months later. I have been passed from department to department, emailing on average once a month to try and resolve the issue. The driver that caused the damage has told me his insurance company case number and as far as he is concerned the matter is closed and his insurance has paid, but I have not received any money. I will continue to email Europcar, but I am wondering if I will ever get my money back. The only thing I am sure of, is that I will definitely think twice before renting with them again!\n\nGuess what? I contacted customer services and according to them the case was closed!! I have been instructed to email them again. Feel like I am banging my head against a brick wall!!!"

I phoned back again half an hour later to ask if a complaint had been logged and I was told the previous person had spoken hadn’t put anything in the system. I asked again to file a complaint (which I’m not sure if they have or not) the car eventually arrived at 16:45 (24hrs later after the original planned time) there were no apologies or explanations given. It seems that there’s a miscommunication issue between (Europcar motability and Europcar Maidstone. I had already had a stressful day on Monday when the brand new (three months old) electric car came to a halt and the Electric Traction battery failed, leaving myself and my disabled daughter sitting at the side of the road for five hours awaiting RAC and tow truck (8 hour before car was recovered) so I really didn’t need their stress on top of it all"

Europcar operate a 'scam' service.\nI was flying from Australia to London Heathrow and decided to hire a car from Europcar during the Doha lay over. I selected the car to be picked up at the airport, filled in all the necessary and selected to pay upfront. The process went through up to my bank where it came back with 'there was an error with your bank' (Scam 1)\n\nI found this odd as there were no issues. I tried a different credit card in case - same response. I tried calling Europcar, no answer. I decided to back myself up by selecting a 2nd rental from SIXT but to pay at the airport. Within seconds I received a SIXT confirmation of booking.\n\nWe arrived at Heathrow on Sunday 23rd March at around 5pm and decided to first go to Europcar as we had in the interim received an email stating 'YOUR CAR IS WAITING FOR YOU' (SCAM 2), and we had made a payment and if it had gone through whilst we were in flight, we didn't want to pay twice.\nBut we couldn't find Europcar. We asked SIXT desk and they said it is a shuttle SERVICE (Scam3). We went back to where the shuttle was supposed to be with 2 trolleys of suitcases. No signage. Went to ask again and told it is lane 3. Pushed the trolleys to lane 3 only to find it was not there. Asked again and directed me back to the first point. We waited 20m for a shuttle and a 20m drive to the EUROPCAR satellite office where there was another wait to be served of 15m. By this time it was now 8pm. I got to the front desk eventually, pulled up my email and the Europcar agent says 'you didn't finish your booking?'. I said I did and showed him the email stating 'your car is waiting'. He said that the booking was not confirmed, and the error message showed that. I asked why if the car wasn't available didn't they show this online and how was a customer to know that an error message for payment meant the vehicle wasn't available? He responded with that he could do the booking manually but there would be a price difference (Scam4). On the app it showed a 30GBP difference between online and at airport booking. We were tired and frustrated so said ok to the difference if it was small. We had booked an Electric JEEP for the week at a cost of 284GBP. The guy came back and said it was now 722GBP. I told him that was unacceptable. He said that due to the fire, all cars were booked out and no other rental company would have a car. It was now nearing 9pm, we had to be at a hotel 2hours drive from Heathrow and I think this is Europcar's plan (Scam 5). We refused to pay the price which was almost 3x that of the original booking and seeing we were not buying this scam, he said he could give a discount and we could get it for 520 GBP. The online at airport booking was 309GBP so he was trying his luck with the higher amounts. We refused and asked them to take us back to the airport.\nOn arrival I went directly to the SIXT desk, was helped by a fantastic and knowledgeable lady and within 10m we had the car which we had selected, at the price we selected. Europcar you could learn a lot from SIXT.\nWe are frequent travellers and will NEVER RENT FROM EUROPCAR again as they deliberately show cars online that they use to lure customers and then when the travellers are tired take advantage and try to scam by tripling the cost of the vehicle. You should be ashamed of yourself Europcar."

I informed them that I had, but had a negative experience regarding fuel charges, despite refueling the car minutes before returning it. I was forced to raise a complaint and provide proof of my fuel purchase in order to receive a refund. The representative apologized and offered me a free upgrade for my current rental.\n\nRental Agreement and Holding Deposit\nI was presented with the rental agreement, which clearly indicated the prepaid amount of £91.00, as well as an additional charge of £86.90, which was explained to me as a holding deposit. I questioned this charge, and it was reaffirmed as a holding deposit, which would be refunded to my card upon the return of the vehicle. This conversation was witnessed by my colleague, who was traveling with me at the time.\n\nFuel Refill and Return of Vehicle\nPrior to returning the vehicle, I refueled the car with 6.91 liters of petrol, totalling £9.66, at the nearest garage to the airport (PA3 2TH), as per the attached receipt. Upon returning the vehicle, I handed the keys to a Europcar representative named Jack, who inspected the vehicle, including its mileage and fuel levels. He confirmed that everything was in order and that no issues were present.\n\nUnjust Charges\nOn March 21, 2025, I received an invoice for additional charges, including a Premium Station Surcharge and a charge for 6 liters of fuel. Furthermore, my credit card has been charged an additional £98.85 on top of the original rental charge of £91.00.\n\nThese charges are clearly erroneous, unjustified, and appear to be fraudulent.\n\nI hereby request that the excess charge of £98.85 be refunded immediately to my credit card.\n\nAdditionally, I wish to file a formal complaint against both the employee who processed my rental and the representative to whom I returned the vehicle. Their actions were misleading and resulted in fraudulent charges being placed against me.\n\nI expect prompt resolution of this matter. Should this issue remain unresolved, I will be forced to take further action to protect my interests."

I had already contacted your company and got a hollow worthless response from that, so no I won't be contacting you again. I've now had the car 2 days beyond me trying to return it and no idea if they'll actually coming today. I'd wager the depot that is supposed to collect it knows nothing about it as your customer service clowns are worthless and when I was on call it sounded like they were struggling to use their computers.\nagain, I will never use Europcar by choice."

I returned it a few hours later having done 42 miles and having filled the tank up to the very brim with £8 of fuel just before drop off. I couldn’t get any more fuel in the tank. They hold £250 from your account to cover any additional costs. Just got my money back but with £10 deducted for fuel! If true this car used £18 of fuel to cover 42 miles. This is a SCAM. I made the guy at the Europcar check the car over with me which was a bit of a walk. The guy was very unhappy, wanting me just to leave the car for him to check later, but came with me. He checked the car inside and out (checking mileage and fuel) and told me everything was OK and that I’d get my full deposit back ‘soon’. When you leave a hire car you are at the mercy of the integrity of these hire companies. Europcar clearly has little of that. I made a complaint and will include the result of that later. However it might be something like:\n\n“Hello John,\nWe appreciate your feedback and we are sorry to learn you were dissatisfied with our service.\nGive us the chance to solve the issue by providing more details using (link removed) where our customer service team will be in touch.\nWe hope to see you again.\nThe Europcar Team”\n…or something like that….."

It was agreed reluctantly on my part that new pickup/drop off station would be Gatwick South Terminal which is 30 miles from where i live. I was assured by the female caller that this modification would not alter the t&c's of the hire contract including the cost.\n14th March 13.12 , the modification email came through which still stayed pickup and drop off Kingston upon Thames.\n17th March 08.04, i rang europcar customer services to again ask for reassurance that this booking had indeed been modified correctly. I was assured that despite the modified booking stating Kingston upon Thames, the team at Gatwick would see this change on their system.\n17th March 11.30 ,i embark on 2 and half hour journey on public transport at my own time and cost to travel to Gatwick.\n17th March approx 14 00, approach service desk, i am.told there is no booking. Customer service agent calls over manager who also looked perplexed and repeated no such booking. I insist and relay the information provided by Kingston. After 5 mins of phone calls and deliberation Customer service agent, tells me that i have 3 different options of car, each costing £30+ per day additional to what i had already paid. I declined having been completely misinformed by Europcar and was told only alternative was a refund. I went outside and immediately called Europcar customer services who passed me back and forth and eventually to complaints. They refused to acknowledge their error and when i asked them to resolve the matter as they were at fault i was told that i would have to make a new reservation at a new cost £200+, but that i would have to wait at gatwick another 3 hours as their system did not allow immediate booking and vehicle retrieval. I have now travelled 30 miles from home on buses and trains to be told a) booking not valid b) i would have to pay another £120+ c) if i want new reservation i would have to wait 3 hours.\nUNACCEPTABLE\nWhile this has been now registered as a complaint and assures an investigation, i insist on satisfactory answers to the following:\nWhy was Kingston upon Thames showing as open and operational on Gatwick system which initially impeded the gatwick staff from seeing the booking?\nWhy, when a customer has already been subjected to a 30 mile trip instead of a 20 min bus ride to their chosen and confirmed place of pick up and drop off, at their own inconvenience, time and money, does Europcar not accept their own internal failures and endeavour to resolve the problem?\n\nI will also be submitting a claim for compensation to cover travel expenses to the airport and the additional cost of hiring a vehicle with another provider who were extremely helpful in overcoming the ridiculous bureaucracy around 2/3 hour wait times for a vehicle when they had one available and ready to go. Needless to say i will not be using Europcar ever again.\nI would appreciate a swift and satisfactory response addressing the abysmal customer service illustrated above\n\nBlanket response from Europcar which failed to address the specific failings of the booking.\n\n\"Thank you for contacting Europcar Customer Services regarding the vehicle not provided for your reservation 1187068944.\n\nFirstly, I would like to sincerely apologise for the lack of provision of the confirmed vehicle. On occasion, unforeseen changes to our fleet utilisation, resulting from extensions or breakdown can result in the Rental station responsible for your hire being unable to fulfil the booking.\n\nI would like to sincerely apologise for any inconvenience that may have been caused, and would like to assure you we constantly review ways to improve our services and minimise any disruption to our customers.\n\nI trust this information assists with your query.\n\nRegards,\n\n\n\nDavid\"\n\nEuropcar UK Group | Customer Services"

Myself and my partner rented a vehicle and mid-way through the trip, when we finally opened one of the back doors, a handle just came off and stayed in my hand. The inside of the door handle was also visibly covered in glue (guessing done by the previous renter), but I would have no way to prove this. We returned the car immediately to the dealership and the agent (which knew us as this point) have assured us that we would not be held liable and that they will report it as damage caused in the previous rental period. Well, in a few months time we got invoiced for the repair of the damage, which we were advised to dispute by the same agent and once again assured that all they have to do is report it as \"damage from the previous rental\". We have emailed and called Europcar customer service to notify we are officially disputing the claims that we have caused the damage. We have got no response after that for months and assumed that maybe it was resolved. However, recently were contacted by Shakespeare Martineau, which is Europcar's legal representation, who have claimed since we neither disputed the claim nor did we pay the funds, we are now threatened by court proceedings and additional charges.\n\nIt is extremely sad and disheartening how the company viciously deceives and manipulates their clients to cover unjust fees. We will probably end up paying a large sums of money for repairs of damage we never caused."

I went personally to the Stockport branch and they said they would refund it. A month later and still no refund and they are not answering the phone.

On returning the car, the car hire people told me that there were two scratches on the door and bumper and the total repair cost would be Euro 2100. The excess payable is limited to Euro975, but the car hire people say that this excess is per scratch, making it possible that you would end up paying more than the car is worth. This seems utterly bizarre. No one in Europcar seems to understand how quoting for work works, let alone their own insurance policies. This position is not resolved and is ongoing."

If somehow you have damage on the ie tyre damage due to a pothole they charge you an extortionate amount of money. Been disputing since January and now is the time they want to open things up again, when you want information from them they get quiet but anything to do with them and money they are loud. they ignored my dispute and charged me a ridiculous amount.\n• Rude & Unhelpful Customer Service – If you try to challenge their charges, good luck. Their customer service team either ignores you or keeps passing you from one department to another with no resolution.\n• Unclear Pricing & Hidden Fees – They lure you in with what looks like a good deal, only to hit you with unexpected charges later.\n\nAvoid Europcar at all costs!

I clearly stated FIVE times that I did not want the premium cover, yet they added it anyway without my consent.\n\nThe agent, Fred, even lied to my face, telling me the extra charge was just the rental deposit—when in reality, it was the premium cover I had rejected. Later, he even called me for feedback, completely unaware that he had charged me for the cover! This proves that Europcar is either incompetent or deliberately deceiving customers to steal their money.\n\nWhen I complained, Europcar’s customer service dismissed my case, simply stating that I had signed the contract—completely ignoring the fact that I was misled and scammed into doing so. This is outright fraud.\n\nI will be reporting Europcar to UK Trading Standards, disputing the charge with my credit card provider, and will continue leaving reviews until this issue is resolved.

      "text": "I had an extremely frustrating experience with Europcar UK due to unjust charges and a lack of accountability.\n\nFirst, I was charged over £100 for roadside assistance, which was never properly explained at the rental desk as a daily fee instead of a one-time charge. Had this been made clear, I would have declined or opted for full insurance, which would have been a far better choice. Instead, I was rushed into signing multiple documents without any real explanation.\n\nEven worse, I was charged over £200 for a faulty tyre that developed a bubble after just 215 miles over 8 days—something that shouldn’t happen with a properly maintained vehicle. This raises serious concerns about Europcar’s safety standards. It seems that Europcar relies on renters purchasing insurance to cover defective or substandard parts, knowing they can shift the cost to insurance companies rather than ensuring vehicles are well-maintained. Those who decline extra coverage are left footing the bill for Europcar’s own negligence.\n\nHoping for fair treatment, I escalated this to BVRLA, expecting them to step in. But rather than questioning Europcar’s practice of shifting costs onto customers, BVRLA chose to focus only on Europcar’s paperwork, avoiding any real attempt to hold them accountable. This approach allows Europcar to continue misleading and overcharging customers without consequences.\n\nRenters deserve better—clear terms, properly maintained vehicles, and fair business practices. Not hidden charges, misleading explanations, and financial penalties for defects that aren’t their fault."

Photos were provided, but I am unable to see any damage in the photos. I have attached a photo they sent, apparently there is a scratch on the front bumper but I do not see one, especially at the resolution provided. Not to mentioning claiming \"damage\" on a bumper - a bumper! - just screams scam.\n\nI was not asked to inspect the vehicle prior to the rental. I was not given any evidence of the condition of the car prior to the rental. (However, the pickup attendant tried to upsell me to cars that were 8x and 6x more expensive than my rental.)\n\nUpon return (to London City), the attendant required me to drive to a remote part of the parking lot for the return - far from the Europcar office and designated return area, with no other cars around, and extremely far from the terminal. I now know why - to be out of view in order to execute a damages claim scam.\n\nThe car was only driven 4 times during the rental, and did not impact anything during those 4 trips.\n\nClaiming that I am responsible for damages is scam-like, inefficient, inappropriate, and terrible customer service. When I stated so to the claims rep, they claimed I should've read the 49-page Terms and Conditions prior to the rental.\n\nHighly advise renting elsewhere."

I had to use my debit card instead of a credit card as the PIN had been changed by my wife. Apparently using my debit card meant that I had to take compulsory and very expensive CD insurance that increased the cost by 112 euros. This was not exp[lained to me at the desk. On return I was invoiced for this extra amount and emailed their support. This was answered that I had signed the agreement when renting so nothing could be done. My point is that I cannot read the full agreements when renting a car especially when stressed to get to my final destination and with a queue behind me. I had bought a policy to cover the excess so clearly did not want or need extra insurance. I think that Europcar should have refunded this charge but they stopped replying to my follow up emails.

However this was in desperation to correct a very justifiable grievance, that had failed at branch level and also Customer services at corporate office. So here goes..\nI had ordered and paid for a manual Intermediate sized SUV. I received an Automatic COMPACT SUV. Europcar's argument is they are MONETARY the same value, so a clear downsize is OK, even if it was NOT discussed, or even mentioned with me at the counter, when collecting my vehicle. In fairness I should have noticed when I got my vehicle, but it was parked next a large Merc SUV so just thought it looked small. My vehicle was a Hyundai Bayon, a very small and questionable SUV of any sort. I had to get to Portsmouth to pick up a disabled family friend and was already late(flight) so headed off. We just managed to get her mobility scooter in the boot but had to use the back seat for her walking frame, mine and her suitcases plus a backpack. Dangerous and also risking damaging the seats. These important facts have been totally overlooked by Europcar, who keep trotting out the same line about \"Monetary\" values of both vehicles were the same. Presumably for my 5 day Intermediate SUV, they could have given me a Luxury car for 2 days or Tiny car for 8 days, because it's the same Monetary value - extreme but the same logic. I never expected the CEO to deal with it, but delegate to an area/district manager who can have rung me and got my side. A request for an area/district managers contact details was made, but again ignored. This incident happened over 2 months ago but wanted to give ample time for someone to act, which is only fair.

Even paid an additional amount on the booking for full insurance for a 7 day hire.\n\nArrived at Fuerteventura airport and was told that the full insurance wasn’t any good as it was taken through a third party. They sold me the full insurance for €285 on top of what I had already paid!!!!! This ensured that any damage would be waived.\n\nPicked up the car and noticed a few marks on it - I wasnt bothered as I had full cover.\n\nReturned the car after 7 days, and with no damage to it. They scoured the car and told me I’d damaged the rear of the car (I hadn’t). Luckily I’d taken out their rip off insurance, so I could walk away worry free.\n\nCan’t help but feel there’s some sort of scam going on here.\n\nStay away!!!!!"

We dropped the car off and two weeks later, I received an additional invoice for 380 GBP for some light scratches on the underside of the nearside, rear wheel arch. It was impossible to make a scratch in this position UNLESS this was originally caused when changing the oversized AMG wheels. First and last time with this company. Awful."

While I stand by my praise for Peter’s outstanding customer service at Heathrow, I feel it’s necessary to share the full picture of my experience — not just for your awareness but also as a warning to future customers.\n\nAfter reviewing my bill, I discovered numerous hidden fees that were never clearly explained. I was offered an upgrade that I was told would cost an additional £20, but I was later charged £150. Worse still, I was asked to sign documents under pressure and wasn’t given a copy, leaving me unaware of the full charges until it was too late.\n\nThis lack of transparency and the feeling of being misled has completely overshadowed the initial positive experience. It’s deeply disappointing, especially during what was already a difficult time for me.\n\nUnfortunately, due to this experience, I will not be using Europcar again and strongly advise others to be extremely cautious when reviewing their rental agreements and charges.\n\nI hope you take this feedback seriously and address these issues to prevent similar situations for future customers.\n\nBest regards,\nOwen\n\n(My original review below)\n\nOutstanding Service from Peter at Europcar Heathrow\n\nI recently visited Europcar at Heathrow on the morning of Friday, 21st, to collect a car for a difficult journey to a close relative’s funeral. Understandably, I wasn’t in the best of spirits, but the exceptional service I received from Peter truly made a difference.\n\nFrom the moment I arrived, Peter’s warm demeanor and positive energy were evident. He went above and beyond to assist me, showing genuine care and professionalism throughout the process. His kindness and willingness to help lifted my spirits more than he probably realizes.\n\nIt’s rare to come across someone who not only excels in their role but also impacts customers on a personal level during tough times. Thanks to Peter, a stressful day became a little easier.\n\nI am deeply grateful for his support and will definitely be returning to Europcar in the future because of this experience. Thank you, Peter!"

The rental process was smooth, and I returned the vehicle in perfect condition, with no damage whatsoever. Europcar even refunded my deposit, confirming there were no issues at the time of return.\n\nHowever, 18 days later, I received an email claiming that I had caused a 5-15 cm scuff on the front bumper. This accusation is completely false. I drove carefully, parked safely, and at no point was the bumper exposed to any situation that could have caused such damage.\n\nI immediately disputed the claim and requested proof, including time-stamped photos and inspection reports. So far, Europcar has not provided clear evidence that the damage occurred while the vehicle was in my possession. Given the time delay, I strongly suspect the damage happened after my rental and that Europcar is unfairly holding me responsible.\n\nThis experience has been frustrating, and I now see many similar complaints from other customers. It feels like a deliberate scam to extract extra money from customers long after their rental has ended. Beware! Always take detailed photos and videos before and after your rental to protect yourself.\n\nI would strongly advise against renting from Europcar unless you want to risk being charged for damages you didn’t cause."

I booked a car for my family trip from 20th December 2024 to 20th January 2025 and paid in full (GBP 1,639.81) upfront. However, the problems began as soon as I arrived at the Gatwick Airport North Terminal after a 30-hour flight from Brisbane.\n\nDespite explicitly informing the staff that I did not require additional insurance because I have Allianz Travel Insurance covering rental car excess, I was handed a document to sign under the pretense of providing a security deposit. Later, I discovered it was a completely new rental agreement with added charges for unwanted insurance and a so-called \"free upgrade\" to a Peugeot PG5008. The upgrade was presented as complimentary because the originally booked MG HS was unavailable, yet I was later charged for it.\n\nUpon returning the car at Heathrow Airport, I was unexpectedly charged GBP 20 for cleaning without prior disclosure. The staff claimed it was because the car floor required more than five minutes to clean. This charge was never mentioned in the rental agreement.\n\nAfter returning to Australia, I discovered an unauthorized charge of AUD 3,889.19 on my credit card, labeled as a second rental payment. I immediately contacted Europcar but received only an automated response. Despite multiple follow-ups, I was given no proper explanation or resolution.\n\nTo make matters worse, I noticed additional unexplained charges of GBP 45 each on 12th and 13th February 2025. Again, these charges were processed without my consent and with no justification provided.\n\nThis experience has highlighted Europcar's lack of transparency, misleading practices, and poor customer service. I strongly advise others to avoid Europcar if they want a stress-free and honest rental experience."

Not only this but they told me they would need to downgrade my car type as the original wasn’t available. Which I can only imagine would have meant that if I’d made the original booking, they wouldn’t have had the car category I’d ordered and paid for anyway. Completely unhelpful and rude on the phone.

What a joke.\n\nI was never informed of the charge before hand, it just appeared on my credit card since someone mistyped my email address.\n\nWhen I argued the point, I was told it would take 5 working days to investigate to confirm. It took well over a month.\n\nDuring this time I was told it was resolved, with no details so I called them and they were still investigating. Then not to call we contact you asap. After a month and many, many emails and calls, I was told I was getting a refund in 3 to 10 days. Then I wasn't. Then it would take 3 to 21 days.\n\nWhen I asked then to cover the interest their error had charged to my credit card, I was told no. It's not possible. Followed by how they offer excellent customer service.\n\nThis company doesn't know their a*@ehole from their elbow. Avoid."

Got all that crap sorted ended up paying an extra 400 instead which is still a joke considering I had already paid for it online but never mind I have to get the kids home. I go to the car it looked nice small crack in the rear light took a picture of it but forgot to take a picture of the inside. There was a rip on the carpet and they are claiming it was me the car was drove no more than 4 time for about 30 minutes each way we had the car for 10 days so it was barely used just sat parked and somehow this old ass rip was me. Opened my bank today to see another 400 pound taken out without contacting me at all. Company is a joke just avoid and catch a train or bus"

      "text": "We hired a car for 7 days, and while hiring the car they were very friendly, but on our last day when we were heading back to the airport the car wouldn’t start. We tried ringing and it took ages to get through but when we told them what happened they said we had to ring the AA. We explained we were heading to the airport and didn’t have much time to waste but he just said I can’t help. You have to ring the AA if they can’t start it they will organise a pick up and you can follow them to the nearest Europcar centre and they will give you another car. We explained we had a 1 1/2 hour drive and by this time needed to be at the airport in less than 2 hours but he just kept saying I can’t do anything else. We then called the AA who said it could be up to an hour before someone could get to us. Obviously we couldn’t wait around for that. Luckily we were staying close ish to the airport with our cousins the night before so we didn’t have such a long drive that morning. They said they would wait for the AA and we had to book a taxi to take us to heathrow. Luckily the traffic wasn’t to bad and we got there just in time. As we were boarding the plane we had a message from our cousins to say the AA had been unable to fix the car and were just then picking it up to take to the euro car centre. Had we not taken the taxi we would have definatly missed our flight. We contacted the customer services centre multiple times after this and they IF they answered my emails it was not with an apology, I was told in the first response to upload the receipt for the taxi and they would pay it back. I complained about the lack of help and the fact we couldn’t use it that last day so that should be reimbursed to but they just said they had closed the case and could do no more. They then sent us an email to say they would reimburse the full mount and take out the full mount minus the cost of the taxi…. But that the reimbursement could take up to a month for international transactions. Without checking first with us they had taken a further £2080 out on our card leaving us then with over £4300 on our credit card while we awaited the payment to eventually go back in. I emailed 4 times after that money was taken out against our credit card without permission… I asked to speak to a manager each time. I never had any responses from those last emails. I am outraged and disgusted by the lack of support from Europcars, I will never use them again and I am going to write this warning on every social media site I can find."

I never asked to add any additional service on top of the booking amount of £ 327.35 which was paid already at the time of booking (before even using the rental service). If I need any additional services, I always make sure that everything is in place and paid for to avoid any surprises and to keep a track of by expense and budget.\nI clearly mentioned \"NO\" multiple times for any additional services to Europe car rental agent (It must be recorded on their camera).\nEven when I said \"NO\" multiple times to any kind of additional services, Europcar's agent printed 'Premium protection agreement' papers without informing me and put in front of me to get my signature with other many agreement documents which is really deceiving and manipulating the valuable customer and forcing unnecessary extra charges to the customers while they are trusting the process. When I explained the situation to them and asked for refund, they denied. Never ever going to book from them. I request you all to avoid such shameless deceivers instead of getting deceived."

I always take photos of the car, looking for dents or scratches etc. Have never thought to check rear wiper to make sure rubber blade is there, will from now on. Did the right thing and reported it when took car back, within 24 hours of realising it was missing. Initially all seemed ok, security deposit was returned. 3 and a half weeks later notified us we would be held responsible as it was 'new damage'. Not only did we then get invoiced for the rear wiper arm also, that was not damaged to our knowledge, was in working order, that is how we realised there was no rubber blade. Still in the dispute process and my friend's account used for the security has had a withdrawal for the full invoice without our knowledge it was about to occur. Will never use Europcar and neither will any of our family or friends. We will be sure to let our travel agent know so she doesn't use them either, it was her booking for us."

Why do they do that? Because customers are given the opportunity to rate customer service at the end of each call if the call end normally - by cutting people off, or by leaving them stranded on hold for nearly an hour so they customer has to put the phone down, the nasty, rude employees don't get poor ratings (and presumably keep their jobs).\n\nWhile I was trying to sort out the horrendous problems in branch, another customer came in, with a walking stick, an elderly man, who was promised someone would deliver his hire car in the morning. When nothing arrived he told me he spent hours and hours trying to call the branch but all calls are routed to Morocco or Bulgaria who refused to put him through. A pensioner, he had no option other than to pay for an emergency taxi at 5pm to the branch to find out why he didn't have a hire care. This is what you will deal with if you use Europcar.\n\nPut them out of business... always leave an honest review, or take them to the small claims court if you can. Never, ever, EVER use Europcar."

I paid for an Audi Q5 but when I arrived they offered me some Alfa Romeo instead which is lower than the class I paid for. After about 30 minutes of driving the yellow check engine light comes on. Complete my journey and try to call them but their office is closed.\n\nThe next day (today) at 8:30am I call customer service who put me through to breakdown who then then put me through to the RAC. Waiting a few hours for them and then get a missed call from them but my phone never rang.\n\nCalled back Europcar and again got transferred. This time they said they would “deal with it themselves”. Shortly after this I receive a call from the AA. Meet the mechanic and on diagnosis of the issue he tells me the engine light is on because the car is overdue a service! He also advises me to contact europcar and forward on the report. He was a gentleman and very courteous and helpful. I must say.\nI spend the rest of the day trying to talk to someone who can help. The worst interaction was with a Vladimir. He said that he couldn’t transfer me to Gatwick even though his colleague managed to an hour before. “But did they pick up?” he asked. No. They didn’t. “So see, I can’t transfer because they never answer the phone.”\nI asked to talk to a supervisor. “I’m not allowed to transfer you to a supervisor”\nHe then said he would send an email to Gatwick and they would reply shortly. His colleague had already sent an email on my behalf several hours previous. I asked him if “shortly” meant by the end of the day but he wouldn’t promise. My interaction with the europcar web of entanglement lasted until 3pm and then the offices were closed.\n\nAll day I spent on my foreign mobile racking up charges. I didn’t use the car. It’s not the car I wanted. It is overdue a service so I wonder is it even roadworthy…. Did the right thing but they refused to help or engage.\n\nI rented the car for 3 days to visit a relative who is ill with cancer. I just wanted a hassle free experience. Instead it was a nightmare. Terrible company. Never again.\n\nI shouldn’t have to pay for the day I spent fighting for them to help and not driving thr car. I shouldn’t have to fight for help. Their system appears to be designed to prevent you from getting through to anyone who can help. The first customer service agent should have taken ownership of my problem to begin with.\nMaybe tomorrow I will get a call. All I want to advice on what to do? I’m not sure the car is even roadworthy."

      "text": "I was their regular customer, but will never use their services again, because after one incident feel like they stole from me. I was using Europcar branch at the London City Airport and rented Fiat 500 on December 18th 2024 for two days. Had no accidents, returned the car safely, only to be told I've made a damage to the front windscreen. A tiny two dots, visible only from close. I'm 100% sure they were there already, but they weren't documented. I did took pictures of the car on the day I've got it, but the problem is that the pictures taken were from the few steps away and although you can see something is there, but if you zoom in, the picture becomes blurry and the damage is not exactly visible. It's so small (like 1mm), you can barely see it from close. So now they've froze my 500£ deposit ant investigating the matter. Investigation is already going for more than a month, no indication when it might end.\nBut even if it did happen, maybe without me noticing, the damage is so minor, you could literally find 50 more scratches this size throughout the vehicle. I mean, it wasn't a new car, to look at a dot and say you'll need what, to replace the screen? And what is there to investigate for a month and ongoing? I'm a single mother working two jobs to survive, these 500£ are very important for me, but the the company doesn't care.\nAlso, I would like to point out the extreme rudeness of the Europcar employee who examined the car upon it's return. She noticed the damage straight away (as if she new where to look) and was acting aggressively towards me. Didn't allow me to take the picture of the tag with her name on it and did not write her name on the Statement of Return report she wrote. Unfortunately, I don't remember her name now, at the moment we spoke I felt under stress, in part because how aggressively she spoke.\nI will forever regret the day I chose Europcar."

They may appear to be competitively priced to begin with, but by the time you see all the nasty extras and hidden charges is already too late. The Customer Support is also in on the trick and they come back to your substantiated dispute with standard automated answers which don't address the problem.\n\nI checked in with a prepaid booking voucher and I was offered three options of cars to choose from, all of similar trim level and of the same category.\n\nAt no point whatsoever was I told that any of these choice might be an expensive \"upgrade\".\n\nNo extra charges were ever mentioned.\nThey just appeared on my credit card one and a half months later.\n\nThis is apparenlty a common and standard malpractise as I found similar complaints in various forums.\n\nI guess their reception staff is so commision-driven that they don't mind bending a few rules by lying and hiding charges.\n\nA very dishonest company with no customer orientation and no ethos.\n\nI wouldnt normally bother writting a review but then I thought if this helps even one other potential customer falling victim to these crooks then is worth the effort."

I've been hiring vehicles fairly frequently for over 30 years, and Europcar was even our contractor at a couple of firms where I have worked, and we never had any issues.\nI have filled out countless booking forms, had my license inspected [which is clean and long standing] and never had a claim on a hire ever.\n\nPerhaps one of their bods will see this, and finally deign to respond to this very annoyed customer one day..."

They bought the car outside and I asked for the existing damages report on the car that I was not provided with and I’ve been told that they are aware of all damages and I will not get charged for them. I took a video of the car in many angles that saved me probably paying over 1000£ in damages fees.\nOn drop off the guy looked around the car for 1 minute the came to me and said that everything is ok and I will receive my deposit back in 4-5 days, I left and then the scammer went back to the car took photos of 2 scratches and added them to the drop off report and said that they were new ones. I never found out until one week later when I received an email from europcar with the claim against me for 2 scratches on the car. I asked for the drop off report and I couldn’t believe when I saw the pictures of the scratches in the drop off report.\nI cannot stress enough telling you how important it is to have videos and photos taken on the start of a hire as they will do everything they can to take some money off you.\n\nBe safe 👍🏻"

I asked why the car I had fully paid wasn't available but got no answer instead the guy would go and talk to his colleagues and then come back trying to make small talk. So after my 23 hour flight the only car available was an expensive upgrade. I was then billed and few days later got a refund then when I returned the car I was billed again."

Will never trust Europcar again, They messed up by renting me a car which they didn't have, their communication was non-existent (if they needed to cancel my booking at short notice someone should have at least rung me to confirm I had got the message) and the customer services were unable/unwilling to help me even though I explained the significant inconvenience they had caused me. Suggest using any other car hire company than these as surely the others don't treat their customers this badly?\n\nUPDATE: Following Europcar's response asking me to 'give them chance to resolve the issue', I have just received a standard response saying they didn't have an available cars and I will be refunded and to accept their apologies. Nothing about their appalling level of customer care, no acknowledgement of the huge inconvenience caused, no gesture of goodwill.

We booked a car online (medium sized) via Booking.com\nWhen we arrived (jet lagged & exhausted after the long flight from Australia), the guy said that the car we had booked wouldn't serve our purposes as we were doing a lot of driving. As per another review, you're a target because you're tired and you just want to get a car and get going.\nLong story short: we ended being \"upgraded\" (supposedly at some discounted cost), but out of pocket an extra GBP1400!! In hindsight, my husband made the observation that when we were talking to the guy about our booking, he had 3 sets of keys in front of him. We figure (in hindsight), that one set was the car we actually booked, the second was a slight upgrade and the third was the set for suckers like us. And, like another reviewer, the upsell about insurance: no, what we had paid for online was not of any use, blah, blah. Then, when we finally get out to the car and ask for some help with how it all operates , they send out some young guy who knew little more than us. We got absolutely NO help working out how to get the GPS to work - when you put in an intended address, after a minute the screen would disappear and the message would come up, something along the lines of \"You need to pay a subscription\". What??? After a week of using our own data on our 'phones due to this limitation (and stopping in at two more car hire offices to try and get help with it, without success), we discovered if we went through another field/screen, the map displayed would actually stay live and not disappear. Fancy having to work that out for yourself, and having the frustration of that limitation for a week, when the company can't help you. (No car manual in the car).\nAlso, like other reviewers, I WISH I HAD READ THESE REVIEWS BEFORE BOOKING!! Additionally, in talking to a friend, she had the same type of pressure to upgrade (although she stuck to her guns) with this company in NEW ZEALAND. This must be part of their policy and company training!! Maybe they get commission if they upsell?\nWould NEVER rent through them again."

I booked the night before after closing—which the system allowed without warning.\n\nAfter waiting nearly an hour, they tried to upsell me a replacement car for £20 more per day. I refused, and the manager eventually approved it at no extra cost, but I was then charged £12–£13 daily for insurance instead. Adding to the chaos, payment delays due to system issues made the process feel rushed and unprofessional.\n\nMy order number was 1185232517. This experience was stressful, disruptive, and unacceptable. I wouldn’t recommend this branch."

      "text": "Our experience with Europcar turned out to be the most expensive and frustrating car rental we've ever had.\n\nWe chose Europcar because their website advertised the Volvo C40. However, upon arrival, the promised car was unavailable. The pick-up process was extremely slow, taking about an hour just to verify ID and address. This delay forced us to reschedule our plans, turning an already busy day into a stressful nightmare.\n\nThroughout the process, we felt bombarded with additional charges. They attempted to add fees for a \"popular pickup location,\" premium protection, and even cleaning—despite us already paying for extensive protection coverage.\n\nHere are some of the key issues we faced:\n\n1. The verification procedure took about an hour. This unnecessary delay disrupted our schedule and caused significant stress.\n\n2. As advised, we paid extra premium protection for the alternative car, thinking it was only a day of use and a premium service would give us ease of mind.\n\n3. While some loose dog hair ended up on our coats and my wife’s trousers, it was minimal. Despite this, Europcar insisted on specialist cleaning, claiming it was required for such a minor issue. We know firsthand that dog hair can be removed quickly with a vacuum and they provide standard cleaning for customers—it certainly doesn’t justify specialist cleaning fees. Plus we used other rental services and this was never an issue\n\n4. The rental was advertised at approximately £120, yet by the end, we were charged over £200 for just one day of use. We ultimately had to involve Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) to contest the cleaning fee.\n\nRegardless of the ADR outcome, we will never use Europcar again and strongly advise others to avoid their service. Renting from Europcar resulted in wasted time, unexpected stress, and substantial additional costs. And please save your reply by saying we need to send an email to your customer service team. We just got their reply. They said it was the final decision to use specialist cleaning service to remove some loose dog hair."

Then they added on an extra day rental for 53 minutes late return when it was due to their own delay in calling me.\n\nI suspect the delay in call back was in order to force the delay and make the extra charge. Very suspicious.\n\nThey then refused to remove that price with a customer service agent who presumably was provided by Little Britain.\n\nIn addition, there was a hidden charge for a \"premium\" drop-off location, which was not in the original agreement or detailed at collection.\n\nI'll soon to be making my feelings clear to over five million users on social media.\n\nAvoid this misleading, fraudulent company which does not value customers and would rather charge for a 53-minute delay in which THEY caused.\n\nYou should, though, perhaps also feel bad for Europcar because they are so desperate for money they insist on charging £25 incorrectly than settle this issue.\n\n* Edit: Europcar have responded to this review informing me to contact customer service. Which I have already done. And which they would already know if they had read my review. Further compounding their uselessness by proving they literally do not listen to what the customer has said."

Initially, I was told there would be an additional charge if the van was booked out after 6:00 PM, which I reluctantly agreed to. However, I was then informed that the system does not allow bookings after 6:00 PM, contradicting the earlier statement. This lack of clarity and inconsistency was incredibly frustrating.\n\nMy booking was accepted for 6:00 PM, which should mean I can collect the van at that time. When I questioned why it was even possible to book for 6:00 PM if collection wasn't allowed, I was told that attempts had been made to contact me throughout the day and that my phone went to voicemail. This was completely false—my phone was on, operational, and I received no missed calls or voicemails. Being provided with such incorrect information only added to my disappointment.\n\nThis was my first time using Europcar, and unfortunately, it has left a very poor impression. The repeated misinformation and lack of accountability suggest a lack of professionalism and integrity. If this is indicative of their standard practice, I find it deeply concerning.\n\nOverall, my experience with Europcar was unsatisfactory, and I am unlikely to use their services again unless significant improvements are made. I cannot recommend them based on this encounter."

At the Europcar collection desk they offered me the insurance upgrade and I declined, so they said how about instead of the additional driver charge I give you the full insurance so your total costs is almost the same. Sure ok that's a good deal to me. To my surprise when I return and review my credit card bill I have 2 charges. 1 from easycar and 1 from Europcar, total 400 more than the price I signed up for when I booked. What a scam. I am disgusted. At least the other rental companies I have used from Manchester airport have never done anything like this.\n\nUpdated in response to your comment below: I had raised it on email already and it remains unresolved. You informed me to go speak to EasyCar about the additional driver charge, which indicates your guy had no authority to do what he did and say 'how about we waive the additional driver charge and use that to top up the insurance instead'. Complete scam, I have contacted the bank re unauthorsied charges on my CC. You shouldn't be allowed to operate like this. It's theft.\n\nBy the way, did you know that Trust Pilot can actually connect you with me if you really want to resolve it. I guess so."

      "text": "After a smooth trip and returning my rental car, I thought everything was sorted. But a week later, I received an email from Europcar informing me of a £35 fine, along with a £45 administrative fee. I immediately paid the fine and sent the proof of payment to Europcar, believing the issue would be resolved. However, much to my frustration, I received a generic email stating that the £45 fee would be charged regardless, even though I had resolved the fine myself, with no intervention required from Europcar.\n\nAfter leaving a review describing this absurd experience, Europcar responded with a standard message:\n\n“Give us the chance to solve the issue by providing more details using this link, where our customer service team will be in touch.”\n\nBut here’s the truth: this is the same canned response Europcar sends to every complaint. It seems like an attempt to publicly appear responsive, but in reality, they simply do not reply to emails. I followed their instructions, submitted my information, and waited patiently. Days passed, and I received no response, no follow-up, and no resolution – just silence.\n\nIt’s clear that this automatic response is nothing more than an attempt to create the illusion of addressing complaints. I wouldn’t be surprised if most customers, like me, never hear back. Europcar appears more interested in maintaining a façade of good customer service than actually providing it.\n\nThis experience has only deepened my disappointment with Europcar. Charging an unfair fee is bad enough, but ignoring customers who seek solutions is even worse.\n\nConclusion: Europcar, your practices are unfair, and your lack of commitment to customer satisfaction is glaringly obvious. To anyone reading this: if you value your money and your peace of mind, avoid this company. I will never rent from Europcar again."

      "text": "After posting a review on Trustpilot, I was invited to “give us the chance to solve the issue by providing more details.” I hope this email outlines my concerns clearly and helps you understand the level of disappointment I feel regarding my experience.\n\nI booked a van online on 8th January, specifically requesting an early pick-up at 7 am. I paid an additional fee for this time slot as I needed to meet a strict schedule to offload at an exhibition. The payment was processed successfully, However, I never received an email confirmation. Fortunately, I took a screenshot of the transaction, which I have attached for your reference.\n\nThe day before the pick-up, I contacted customer services to confirm my reservation and was assured that my booking had been processed and the van would be ready at 7 am the next day.\n\nOn the day of collection, I arrived at the Enfield branch promptly at 7 am, only to find the branch closed. I waited outside until someone eventually arrived at 8 am – an hour later than expected.\n\nI explained to the staff member that I had booked a van for 7 am, only to be told that \"this never happens.\" Eventually, I was given two options: continue with the booking and contact customer services later or cancel the reservation and rebook on the spot. Already behind schedule due to the delay, I chose to continue with the booking.\n\nThe issues didn’t end there. I was provided with a van but had to wait for the windscreen to clear as the branch had run out of de-icer. Adding to my frustration, the van’s dashboard display did not clearly indicate how much fuel was available. This only became a problem during drop-off when I was informed that I needed to refill the tank. I incurred an additional cost of £35 for refuelling, which seemed excessive given the distance I had driven.\n\nThroughout the day, I attempted to contact customer services. On my first call, the agent hung up on me. On my second attempt, I was told there was nothing that could be done.\n\nIn summary, I am deeply disappointed with this entire experience. From the lack of professionalism displayed by your staff to the failure to provide basic services (such as having the van ready at the booked time), every aspect of this booking was poorly handled.\n\nFurthermore, the additional £35 refuelling fee and the absence of any apology or meaningful resolution from customer services have left me questioning your commitment to customer satisfaction. I expect a full refund of the additional costs incurred, along with an explanation of how you intend to prevent such issues from happening in the future.\n\nThis is the response I got from Customer services.\nThank you for contacting Europcar customer services in regards to the reservation xxxxxx and for taking the time to share your experience with us.\n\nI truly apologise for the frustration and disappointment you encountered during your recent rental. I fully understand the impact that these issues have had on your schedule, and I am genuinely sorry for the inconvenience caused.\n\nI deeply regret that the van was not ready at the agreed time, and I recognise the importance of punctuality, especially when you had a tight schedule to meet. I also apologise for the lack of acknowledgment from our staff and the difficulties you faced with the windscreen and fuel gauge. This is certainly not the level of service we aim to provide.\n\nI am pleased to inform you that I have refunded the extra 60 GBP fee you paid for the early 7:00 am pick-up. The refund has been processed and should appear in your account up to 10 working days.\n\nPlease know that your feedback is important to us, and we are taking it seriously. We are reviewing our processes to ensure this kind of situation does not happen again in the future.\n\nOnce again, I apologies for the inconvenience and stress this caused, and I truly appreciate your patience throughout this matter. If you need any further assistance or have additional questions, please do not hesitate to reach out. I am here to help.\n\nRegards,\n\nEuropcar UK Group | Customer Services"

This was about half an hour after picking up the van in Southampton.\nAlmost immediately after picking the van up, the accelerator started whirring (as a result of a radio program, when I heard someone mention that this sound can result from a broken turbocharger, I questioned whether the van was turbocharged but received no reply).\nThe van had stalled about 10 times on the way (but obviously not on the motorway which makes up the bulk of the distance)\nIt was my intention to turn off Park Road at the bottom (which you used to be able to do - I had done this in the opposiute direction only recently) but I soon found out that that was no longer possible. It is hard to say because I no longer live in Portsmouth but presumably there were signs indicating that after crossing the traffic lights the only option was to enter Gunwharf Quays (several hundreds of metres away), but I was distracted by the smoke (which I only slowly realised was coming from my van)\nYou would not expect such a thing to happen to a rental vehicle only half an hour after you had picked it up\nInexorably I was drawn into Gunwharf Quays, into the underground car park. There appeared to be no obvious 'escape routes' and when I hit the height restriction sign there was no obvious way out (all this was happening while I was being distracted by a van that could, for all I knew, burst into flames at any moment'). By this time I was half underground, with a queue of traffic behind me - it would have seemed likely to me that was still an 'escape route' moving forward (which is the only way I could go), until I hit something. I am still not 100% certain what I hit - it was not a low roof or anything like that which would have been obvious to see coming.\nIt seems strange to me to be only told about height restrictions when it is too late to do anything about it.\nI had no option but to go backwards, under guidance from staff, and then parked up about 50 metres away, after being sent down an unmarked 'escape route' leading to the shops. That was when I called the AA because of the smoke\nThe AA man just made some claims that I must have been riding the clutch and then let me go. I then left to go to Western Parade\nAfter loading up, the van limped about 30 metres before coming to a stop and refusing to re-start. I then called the AA for a second time\nAfter coming to the conclusion that the clutch was burnt out, this second AA man was with me for about 3 hours and arranged the consequences. The van was taken away by Boarhunt. Europcar paid for a hotel room for the night\nProblems\nRight from the beginning, Europcar have claimed that the AA only attended once. But this is illogical. The van was not taken away after this first AA visit at between 11 and 12 in the morning and it was not taken away from Gunwharf Quays. It was taken away about 11 hours later from Duisburg Way which is about 2 km away.\nThe clutch had gone and this was unlikely to have resulted from the actions of any driver within half an hour.\nThey seem to imply that I picked up the van from Southampton and then within half an hour I had not only reached Portsmouth but had loaded the back of the van completely with my worldly goods.\nIt is not good service to have problems within half an hour of taking possession\nPersonal Consequences\nExtra expenditure to me was around 800 pounds. But after they announced on Friday that they were not going to supply a replacement van, I decided to travel up to Liverpool and arrange things at my new flat. Unfortunately I couldn't find anywhere to stay on the Saturday so I had to spend the night in a local park, an experience I hope to never repeat (this was a night when I should have been spending my second night in my flat). This experience almost trumps the loss of money"

It was 3.30 in the morning. I was now panicking as I had a flight to catch. Eventually myself and family managed to get a taxi.

I nearly missed my flight, it was very stressful.\nAs soon as I landed back in UK, I called europcar to explain the situation. Worst Customer service they were so unorganised and unhelpful. I had no apology for the inconvenience. To my horror I then get a email invoice to say that they were charging me another €180 for breakdown recovery and a surcharge. This is utterly unacceptable. This was through no fault of my own. They should be compensating me! I only hired the veichle for 2 day. Costing my a whopping €200 euro with fully comprehensive insurance, which I assumed would cover you for any breakdown during your rental. I would advise anyone to never use this company utterly apporling treatment."

      "text": "The worst, utterly disgraceful, experience I've ever had hiring a car. I booked a manual for two days, went to collect it from the Victoria London branch. I mentioned I only needed it for one day but had to book it for two as there was no mention online I could drop it off after hours on the day I needed it. The manager told me I could have booked it for one day. As compensation, as he added he couldn't change the booking in his system (???) so he offered to upgrade me to an automatic for free so long as I dropped it off by Saturday 1pm. I agreed, signed the form and returned the car full of petrol by 1pm Saturday. I then received notification from my bank that I'd been charged two days using an automatic, plus two days insurance. I called Europcar customer service to complain. They told me as I signed the contract there was nothing they could do. Plus they refused to put me through to the Victoria branch manager or put me through to their senior manager to raise the complaint. Incensed, I then went to the Victoria Europcar shop to explain to the manager the booking error. He wasn't there. I went again and again and again, three times he still wasn't there. These three times I explained to the Victoria staff in the manager's absence the mishap that had happened. Each time the staff I spoke to told me they'd get the manager to call me to sort out the mis-booking. The manager never called me. The fourth time I arrived at the Victoria branch, the manager was finally there, but kept me waiting 1/2hr before he turned up to talk to me. He looked surprised at my appearance and said he'd heard nothing about my complaint from any of his staff or customer services. The staff member behind me, who I'd met the day before and who'd promised to pass on my message, put his head in his hands. We knew perfectly well the manager was lying. He then told me I was lying and had made this whole thing up. He said he never offered me a free upgrade to an automatic from a manual car. He added, as I'd signed the contract my complaint meant nothing. But the contract I signed was misleading. The sum for £164 was black bold with lots of small type around it. This amount sounded about right for a 2 day manual hire including insurance I'd agreed to add on to the initial £115 fee. Not the £320 that was actually deducted from my bank account for a two day automatic hire. The manager walked off dismissing me. I called Europcar customer service again to complain. Three times the Europcar customer service put the phone down on me. I can't tell you how unjust, dishonest, disgraceful and unsettling this experience has been. I will never hire a Europcar EVER again."

At the east London branch I was given a large SUV sized vehicle (I didn’t know the size of it at the desk - an MG HS). During the rental I unfortunately kerb damaged an alloy wheel due to the size of the vehicle. On return the branch was closing and staff advised me to use the drop box which I did. The next day I was charged £70 for early return of the vehicle, on complaining Europcar said they would refund the amount due to an error. Am still awaiting the refund. With regard to the alloy wheel damage, Europcar three weeks on have yet to provide an invoice for the damage in order for me to raise an external insurer claim. Attempting to contact Europcar at a UK office is impossible via telephone and emails are replied to in a generic fashion with no attempt made in resolving issues by their staff. Overall experience is dreadful. Am genuinely sad for Europcar in the UK as I have used them for 6 years previously and found their service fair, even when minor damage has happened."

He said, \"you definitely need something bigger where you are headed and I have just the car\".\n\nThere was no mention of additional costs whatsoever.\nWho wouldn't like a free upgrade when they're headed into the Scottish outback?\n\nSome papers were elegantly shuffled around, we were told to sign here, here and here. After that we had to pop our card into the machine for the deposit and it was a done deal. Only it wasn't.\n\nThe trickery and the damage.\nThe upgrade was not free of charge and the additional cost of the rental was £171.86 or EUR 205. EXTRA! That's more than the initial rental booking. Both numbers look extremely similar by the way. When we inserted our card for the deposit, we in fact paid for the upgrade. That was NEVER mentioned to us. We also never paid for a deposit, which is utterly bizarre. The kicker is that we didn't receive an end of rental statement either. Also, the charge for the upgrade was not taken out until 2 weeks after the rental (06/11/24). So even if we had paid with Monzo, which shows charges instantly we would not have realised it then and there at the counter.\n\nOf course we signed the papers and that's enough for Europcar. Why would they care? Their golden boy Euan is ripping off people by the planeloads making the rental car company a F-ton of extra money. Unfortunately our broker nor our bank couldn't help, but that's not the end of it. A quick Google search reveals that this isn't Euan's first con nor that Europcar will ever see the promised land.\n\nBEWARE: Euan is a smirking bastard who is out to get you. Be it extra insurance you don't need or \"free\" upgrades.\n\nPLEASE read what you sign.\n\nFURTHER ACTION will be taken via BVRLA.\n\nIf you read this and were scammed as well please take action.

The writing on the rental agreement was so bad and resembled the amount in Euros I prepaid but was in fact the extra amount for the upgrade in GBP! Instead of 172.15 Euros, we paid £172 extra for the unsolicited upgrade. He shuffled the papers in front of us, no detailed explanation and we signed. I usually read every single line on these contracts but he had a talent to charm and con us into it.\nWhen I entered the card into the card pay machine, I assumed it is for the deposit. We were not given any receipt for any transaction at any time, again, thinking it is for the deposit.\nIn the Europcar yard I realised that there were no small cars parked anywhere and again assumed that we got a larger one because they didn't have a small car available.\nOnly when I checked my bank account when we were back from Scotland, I realised that we got charged for the upgrade on top of the initial payment! A deposit was never taken out of the account. The fact that the money was only taken out of my account 2 weeks after the rental also shows that nothing was done by the book. If I had seen the amount on a receipt or in my transactions straight away, we could have turned on our heels. But if you get deceived in such a way, you don't expect bad intention. We also never received an end of rental statement via email as it usually is the case.\nI filed two complaints with Check24, the German booking website, however, they closed the case twice after trying to solve the issue with Europcar.\nThis is not where it ends, Europcar. I'm taking this to the BVLRA for further investigation. It can't be the case that so many people get scammed by Europcar and get away with it.\nAnd if you, Europcar, send an automated reply to this rating and how sorry you are about the experience, then do something about the scammers you employ at your rental desks.\nThis has to end!"

However, upon arrival, the staff member seemed confused about my booking and initially provided me with a petrol car instead of the EV I had reserved. After realising the mistake, she had to swap the cars, causing a delay. As a result, I did not receive the car until 1:36 pm.\nWhen I returned the car, I made sure it had a battery charge level of 55%. Yet, the invoice inaccurately claims that the charge level was only 42%.\nThe problems didn’t end there. On 7 January 2025, I noticed that £54.86 had been deducted from my deposit without any explanation or invoice. I contacted Europcar to inquire about this, but I have received no response.\nThis experience has left me deeply frustrated. Not only does Europcar fail to deliver accurate service, but they also show no regard for transparency or customer communication. If you rent from them, be prepared for false charges and the possibility of having to pursue legal action to recover your money. I will now be commencing legal proceedings to address this issue.\n\nI strongly advise others to avoid Europcar entirely. This was one of the worst rental experiences I’ve ever had."

The next day the AA came out and said it was the 6th time they'd been out for the same car in 10 weeks and to take it straight back to Europcar. Despite numerous phone calls and emails, and proof of the problems from the AA, they have refused to offer any refund for the vehicle rental.\n\n**I have submitted my appeal to the BVRLA for assistance**"

I received a \"your car is ready from Warrington branch\" email at 8am on 30th Dec. I arrived at the branch - to find it had closed down months ago! I phoned customer service ( waited a long while and was charged a lot for a 0371 number). All the operator kept saying was \"sorry\", said there was no manager to talk to and id have to travel to Liverpool to collect a car, and take it back to Liverpool. We were due to leave on our holiday at 9.30am, my family were at home waiting. We had family we'd not seen for 20 years meeting us half way to our destination for lunch, which we didn't make and they've now returned to Canada. I was left in tears trying to get someone to help me. I had to get another car from a local car hire, which because of the late notice was twice as much. I still to this date have had no explanation or a phone call which I was promised. Europcar simply do not care. I've e-mailed, I tried to call, but not a single word back. I have no idea how Europcar are allowed to trade when they illegally sold me a service that did not exist and now I am £250 out of pocket, because of their error."

Also increasing my frustration on this was that I had booked what was supposed to be one of their premium cars and to be frank it was a wreck which when I complained at pick up was told \"its driveable so its rentable\" and \"if you want to replace the best we can provide you with is this car\" a car which was not a \"premium car\" and not in any way the same size to accommodate our Luggage.\nI would strongly recommend not to use this company, I certainly won't be doing again.\nUpdate following response from Europcar\nThankyou for your prompt response however please note that I did not write this review immediately after the issue, I communicated via email with your Customer Services on various occasions and it was only after receiving unacceptable responses that I posted this review."

I really just wanted to book a car for a week, pay for it, with the price quoted and safely drive to my destination. I was quoted £467 for a car for 1 week which I think is way too much anyway. After booking I rang customer service as a change in plans meant I needed an infant car seat for my 4 month old baby. This was completed over the phone, quote changed slightly. I rang and emailed customer services the day before travel and was reassured everything was as it should be. Imagine my surprise when I arrived and was told I did not have a car seat booked, just a device (apparently a legal requirement seeing as Italian people have a tendency to leave their children in cars!) So I was charged for a car seat. Then pressure sold insurance. My £467 escalated to £968 (including a £100 hold on my credit card). The rep at the desk then handed me the most disgusting, filthy car seat, absolutely not fit for a 4 month old and told us to go and find the car, with 2 suitcases, bags and a baby in a pushchair. Checked my credit card statement, final charge was £721.33 + £21.27 non sterling transaction fee 🤣."

I said i didn't want it but they then went and charged me for it anyway a week later thinking i wouldn't notice!!?? They also tried to get me to pay for fuel i might not need by trying to charge me for a full tank of fuel in advance. You say 'make sure its empty before you return it' so you expect the customer to just drive around aimlessly burning off fuel that they didn't need to pay Europcar for in the first place? They're basically a bunch of fraudulent con artists and their sneeky pressure tactics to get more money out of people is absolutely disgraceful."

The first line you see on the t’s and c’s is the above (quote - UNDER 25’s), and you have to “click to read more” to read further where you see the line, “25’s AND under will be charged” etc. Why would I click to read further if the first, summarised thing I read clearly states it is relevant for UNDER 25’s, not 25 AND under?\n\nTo add to this, the fee wasn’t added until I arrived to collect, so I also could not cancel my car. I was within the 6 hour pick up time and so I would have been charged the full fair. I was left with no option but to take the charge, all because of an error on their side. My £390 car turned into a £980 one!! Absolute rip off.\n\nI feel I am entitled to a refund on this surcharge fee, and I would certainly not suggest Europcar to anyone."

      "text": "EDIT:\n\nEuropcar's response below suggests the left-hand doesn't talk to the right. I HAVE BEEN TALKING TO Customer Services, and they won't do anything.\n\nORIGINAL:\n\nI hired a van from the Wallisdown, Dorset branch, and the experience was nothing short of infuriating. Almost immediately after driving off, the door sensor alarm started blaring non-stop. No matter how many times I opened and closed the door, the alarm wouldn’t shut off. I was on a strict schedule, so I had no choice but to deal with the unbearable noise for the duration of my rental. I didn’t mention it right away, but when I returned the vehicle, I reported the issue, only to be told that because I had already checked the van back in, I would need to contact Head Office.\n\nAfter numerous frustrating emails, Head Office’s response was to offer me a voucher for future use—as if I would ever consider renting from you again! To top it off, the voucher comes with the delightful note that I can't even use it to hire a van. How utterly ridiculous. The hours of distress caused by that incessant, faulty sensor left both myself and my passenger with searing headaches. As an act of goodwill, I’d expect at least some form of compensation, yet here I am, left with nothing but a sour taste in my mouth. You’ve completely failed to address the issue, and I won’t be returning.\n\nAnd as a side note, I booked for a 2-day rental but returned the van after just one day. Yet, somehow, the staff \"forgot\" to inform me that the price wouldn't reflect a full refund, not even close to half the cost. It's shocking how careless and dishonest this entire experience has been.\n\nBONUS ISSUE\n\nLow Oil Sensor Warning: To make matters worse, the low oil sensor also activated during my rental. This raises serious concerns about the vehicle’s roadworthiness and the quality of maintenance checks your fleet undergoes before being rented out to customers."

The Europcar guy ask me the credit card again, ID documents again, providing me a new paperwork and give me an equivalent vehicle. Arrived at the hotel. having look at the new documentation, I realize an extra £2000 on that agreement. So the next day I made a phone call to Europcar asking what was that amount? a guy provide me a new phone number for accounting assistance on that matter. So, the new person was explain me, that amount of £2000 was a deposit, nothing was charged, if vehicle is returned with full gas on it, and without any damage, I Have an executive plan with Europcar, renting vehicle since more than 20 years., after 2 days, the Volvo x60 they gave me, stop running, so I had to call the assistance. Assistance van of AA, comes to my hotel, the guy say car has a fault on the battery electronic, so he was able to start with a new battery, asking me to return the brake down vehicle to London (2 hours driving ) take another vehicle and going back to the hotel, with another substitutive car for another 2 hours of driving. I'm 80 year old, planning to spend Christmas time with my family, due my daughter was need to have a surgery on 26 dec. So was really not possible to do this for me.

Vehicle then start again., but I lost all the morning waiting for the repair with no more time to take my family at the shopping tour programmed. At the end of the week I returned the vehicle to Europcar. and back to my country. after few days I received on my email. an invoice and I WAS CHARGED FOR AN EXTRA £2000 !!!! REASON UPGRADED VEHICLE (that I didn't ask) and AIRPORT FEES???? Called my bank for block that charged, They couldn't do it.

I see from other reviews that they supply courtesy cars for the mobility scheme, fair enough - these people aren’t paying directly so should be happy with whatever they’re given but when you’re paying your own money it is just not good enough.

I had no desire to upgrade as it was already expensive and I didn't need a bigger vehicle. This was before I even knew exactly what make and model of car I was about to receive.\nWhen I did finally get the keys to my rental car, having had a £700 pound deposit taken from me, I discovered I had unintentionally rented an MG3. My heart sank. The deposit, whilst huge in my opinion wouldn't have bothered me so much, however it had to be taken from my debit card as that was the card I had used to make the booking. I asked to use my credit card for this but was told that wasn't allowed. Now I'm £700 short over the Xmas period with a mortgage and bills upcoming!!\nI drove the car away, having travelled no more than a mile and already I found the car to be unbearable, the thought of a 5.5hr journey on the M6 when I hadn't even yet reached 30mph was frightening.\nThe road noise was so intrusive I could barely hear my own thoughts, my skeleton was starting to feel the effects of the terrible chassis and suspension.\nI can only describe this car as a very basic vehicle barely meeting the definition of a car, nevermind a modern car. The engine was so gutless, it was like it was powered by a sewing machine but with the noise of a tractor. The suspension felt like it was made of wood and bricks rather than springs and dampers. The headlights when it became dark were she equivalent of 2 candles and the whole time I'm starting to develop a head ache and ringing ears. I hated this car, really hated it. A quick search on auto trader revealed from 41small cars the MG3 to be the worst at #41.\nMy experience got worse when I returned it.\nI returned the vehicle early as I was keen to get my deposit back, so wanted to be present when it was inspected on its return. However, I was told that that vehicle wouldn't be inspected until the following day, where it would sit in a public multi-storie car park overnight. The car could be in a very different condition over that time to when it was returned.\nWith regards to the car when I complained, the agent's response was \"it's because it's a cheap car\". Wow!\nNow, the car has been returned, but not inspected at that point. I phoned the branch the next at 14:00, but the office is closed, so I phoned customer services. They couldn't even confirm the car had been returned and didn't even know where it was. What??\nFollowing day, I phoned the branch to ask for confirmation that the vehicle had been returned and it's condition so I could be assured I was going to receive my deposit. I was told a manger would email me, that didn't happen. A 2nd phone call later in the day and I was told they hadn't emailed me because it was via a broker. They had my email address which had been provided no less than 3 times. I had to push hard for them to agree to send an email confirming the condition of the vehicle and that I was going to get my deposit back. Unbelievable!\nHaving hired many cars from other vendors I've always had a good experience,where the vehicle has been checked on return and good communication, not with EUROPCAR. I will never use them again. Ever!\nBy the way not only was the car rated 41/41, it only has a 3* euro cap rating, meaning it's just about safe."

Once a fine is paid you cannot appeal it which leaves you in a catch 22 situation. They will then charge you 45 pounds for administration and take the full amount from your credit card even if you are not guilty. Best practice hirersvwill always give the customer chance to appeal a fine before paying it."

When I arrived at the branch to collect the car, I was told the type of vehicle I selected was not available, the only one available was a fiat 500. I am quite tall person 5'8 so this car was really uncomfortable, nevertheless I accepted as it was only for 2 days, and my next rental was with enterprise (who are so much better, it's like night and day). I can only thank God that I actually took photos of the entire vehicle, before taking it out, honestly, never forget to inspect the vehicle before driving off with it. There was one of their employees staring me down while I was doing this (he looked so annoyed) so I called him over and asked why the tyres had no dust caps, plus I mentioned the same scratches and scruffs the woman who gave me the keys had mentioned. He literally said \"don't worry we don't consider those.\" Upon returning the vehicle, I handed over the keys and they did not inspect the car while I was there, I was told my deposit would be in my account after the woman inspects the vehicle (the same guy I saw when I was taking the pictures and the same woman who gave me the keys we're chatting really in deep conversations) so she was saying I can leave. So I left, the money was returned into my debit card, as I didn't use a credit card, I received a statement of return few days later, and the said I tore/ ripped the two front tyres, funny that because I had the exact same pictures of these \"tears/ ripped\" tyres from that moment I took the pictures before leaving with the vehicle. A few days later I received another email on Christmas Eve of damage notification of the exact same tyres I photographed. This is by far the least worst experience I've actually read on here. I don't understand why they would release my deposit if they believed I damaged the tyres. There is no way they can charge my bank and just in case they do I've already reported the account I used as stolen/ blocked."

When going back to the counter they closed and locked up in the 5 min it took us to walk to the car. Was 10pm at night so nothing to do but take the rental or be stranded two hours from our hotel. Ended up with the car breaking down and then being charged \"damage\" fee and nearly missed our flight. Disputed and dealt with the absolute worst customer service.

I said I was worried about them trying to charge me for any damage that may occur between Saturday and Monday but they assured me it'll be fine.\n\nI have emailed a complaint however had not heard back and I'm filled with anxiety that they are going to try and charge me more.\n\nPlease save your sanity and do not book with this company."

      "text": "The practices of the London Gatwick office are completely and utterly fraudulent. I write this review so others can be armed with information and well prepared not be defrauded by this specific Europcar office of London Gatwick airport.\n\nI rented a car on the 30th August with no additional insurance protection to cover the excess because it was already covered on my credit card insurance. I communicated this to the representative who then included medium protection on the package and completely disregarded my verbal request. He asked me to sign the back of the page which I did as it was left completely blank without any additions.\n\nAfter the rental had ended I recognised I had been charged extra on my credit card although there was no follow up email from Europcar to inform of any of the charges (although my email was clearly included on the agreement). I called the office and to my shock they forwarded through the back page agreement which now had handwritten additions of the medium protection package.\n\nEuropcar, let’s be clear, this is complete and blatant fraud to change a document after it has been signed! Not only this, but I was also charged for 7 days of insurance even though the rental lasted for only 5 days! See photos on Google Review of Europcar London Gatwick for confirmation of this. This rental finally cost me almost triple the price that what was originally agreed in the initial reservation.\n\nTherefore, I advise anyone attending the Europcar Gatwick office to follow these recommendations:\n1. Record your conversation on your phone with any attendant at this office. If the attendant complains or refuses then point them to this review and ask to speak with their manager.\n2. Ensure that the attendant countersigns any documents in front of you before leaving the counter. If the signature looks similar to the one I have posted on the Google review then I advise requesting a manager or another attendant to complete the rental agreement.\n3. Cross out any inclusions that are not agreed to and take a photo of the main rental agreement and the back page that list additions so it can’t be changed afterwards.\n4. Finally, please post your review of this office so that others can be informed of this fraudulent behaviour, and the individual perpetrators are held accountable.\n\nEuropcar: If this review means that customer check-in at the Gatwick office takes far longer than any other office then you only have yourselves to blame. I have called customer service on multiple occasions with no action being taken. I have also sent multiple emails that all have been ignored now for over 3 months, which is well over the cited 7-10 days reply time that is promised. You will find the ignored case number as #21259873. I request that a refund be issued for these unauthorised charges and that this fraudulent behaviour of Europcar staff is prevented from occurring any further, especially by the individual that signed this document. If you want to show any endeavour to remain a reputable company then I expect a prompt reply to this review via my email which you have on file. My previous experiences with Europcar have all been positive but this is appalling. It is also worth checking that in all my other rentals I have never requested insurance and I never will. Please check your records to confirm this."

I was happy as I have not had issues with Europcar before.\nTravelling with my 5yo Daughter I decided that I would just pick up a car seat at the airport THIS WAS MY FIRST MISTAKE. To hire a child seat for the day is a ridiculous price the guy at the counter told me something like 16 pounds per day almost the same price as the car. Hiring for over a week this was a huge extra cost (cheaper to buy one). However I was told that for an extra £30 per day I could get an upgraded car and forget about cost of car seat. Reluctantly I agreed, and with a quick swoshing of paperwork I signed the paperwork. As I booked the car in one currency and the documents are in a different currency I did not do the maths I just kept in mind the 30£ extra per day. When I got the bill there was an extra charge of 100 from the 30£ per day quoted. Having spoken to 2 different people at europcar one said it was Vat one said it was a location charge. In either case it does not seem clear to Europcar what the charge is for.\n\nI have tried clarifying this with Europcar on two occasions and have just been fobbed off. The last person I spoke to said they would raise a case.\n\nRecommendation to anyone using Europcar. Be careful of the extortionate cost of hiring car seats, Read the paperwork you sign very carefully, I actually feel they purposely deceive weary travellers into signing things and paying uneccesary upgrades. Also don't expect customer service to help afterwards.\n\nIf you book through an alternative supplier probably best not to upgrade at all as you just get tied up in paperwork."

It stated that I could leave a deposit instead of using a credit card. However, upon arrival at Goldcar Portugal, I was informed that they do not accept deposits under any circumstances. This was the first misleading claim.\nAdditionally, the voucher indicated that renting a device for automatic payment on highway tolls was optional. Again, this was false. According to the staff at the Goldcar counter, the toll payment device is mandatory, not optional as stated in the voucher.\nDue to these inaccuracies and misleading representations on Europcar’s voucher, I was unable to use the service as it would have incurred significantly higher costs than initially quoted.\nI wrote an email complaint to Europcar, clearly outlining how the service they sold me was misrepresented and requesting a refund. After an unacceptable delay of eight weeks, I received a dismissive, generic response that completely ignored the reason of my complaint, simply stating that no refund would be issued because the voucher was not used. This completely missed the issue: I did not use the voucher because of the false terms Europcar provided.\nI responded to this inadequate reply, requesting a proper analysis of my complaint. Four months have now passed, and I have yet to receive any follow-up or resolution.\nIronically, when I submitted a negative review on Europcar’s customer satisfaction survey, I was contacted multiple times the same afternoon. Unfortunately, this was futile as the representatives could not address my complaint, citing it as a matter for a different department."

      "text": "I recently made a booking using Europcar and would implore that they are avoided.\n\nI reserved a vehicle on 25th November for collection from the Inverness branch on 16th December. Payment was taken in advance upon reservation. Upon arriving at the airport at 9pm on 16th December, the keys were not released to me. No reason was provided. I was handed a piece of paper with an email address to find out further information. I was then stranded at the airport with no way to reach my destination. The airport eventually closed and I had to wait outside for a ride to my destination as my presence in the airport was not allowing the airport staff to leave and I did not wish to delay their arriving home safe. Europcar didn’t have a similar concern as I was left outside in the rain, in the Scottish Highlands, at 10pm. Surely 22 days is ample time between the reservation being made and my collecting the car to prevent this from happening?\n\nThe following day I sent an email to the email address I was provided to inquire further. The email was re-directed to the branch. I found this odd, as why would the branch instruct me to email the address provided if that email address was going to re-direct me back to the branch? Regardless, I waited a further day for contact. No contact was received. I then began to get concerned as they had already taken payment and my booking was live on the app and I had not received a refund. I proceeded to call Europcar on three occasions. On each occasion the advisor tried their best, but due to company policy being flawed, they were unable to advise me regarding my refund or the booking. Each advisor referred me back to the branch. I would recommend they listen back to the call logs in this instance as all three advisors agreed that the situation was a mess.\n\nThe branch did not contact me as promised, so I returned to the branch. No further information was provided and I was once again referred back to head office.\n\nThis has been a horrendous ordeal. Europcar need to consider the appalling customer experience that is delivered. Note I am a repeat customer, having rented cars on three occasions using Europcar, and was still treated terribly.\n\nDo not use. There are other rental companies that will take your custom and deliver what is promised.\n\nEDIT: in response to the canned response left by Europcar, I contacted using the link provided and have not received any response. An urgent issue treated without consideration on their end…"

They charge for the same scratch multiple times, there is no evidence at the paperwork, if you ask them, they would come with an internal ruler showing what size of scratch or dent is allowed and where but if you go to the terms and conditions, there is no such a thing like 'a damage size allowance' on regular cars. Scratch on the wheels were on the photos before and after, they sent me bill 521 gbp for scratch on 2 wheels. Car returned in August 2024, invoice came in Oct/Nov 2024, I have dispute, as on 18/Dec still not resolved.\nAlso, I have another contract with them, where a car had a sticker it has been cleaned but in fact there were spiders nets on multiple areas, not cleaned at all, screenwash was completelly dry, with multiple scratches all over and without any evidence in paperwork. The car was in unsafe condition. We phoned multiple times, sent emails, with official letter and photos attached, without any answer or solution. It has been since August 2024, till Dec 2024 still open case, no answer.\nOn the other hand they want to send my 'unpaid invoice 521 for their damages' to solicitors.\nWhen I sent an email with photos, they replied I have not sent the correct photos, etc.\nI am preparing official complain to inform car rental regulators.\n\nI have rented cars with turo, I have 5* reviews, also with alamo and others. From what I tried, just europcar is a massive scam."

The car was delivered with only 3/4 of a tank of fuel, despite their policy stating it should arrive with a full tank, yet I was still charged for fuel I didn’t use. When it came to collection, they left the car in my driveway for over a week and then gave me just two hours’ notice while I was 800 miles away on business. I had to scramble to get my brother to drive 60 miles round trip to hand over the keys.\n\nDespite these massive inconveniences and their lack of professionalism, Europcar has shown no interest in addressing my concerns or resolving these unfair charges.

However the Swindon branch has topped this by generating an invoice in Dec for me hiring a van for 8 days excess mileage and a late return billing me over £500. This relates to a 3 day hire in October that was all settled and van returned on time and less excess mileage paid. After receiving emailed invoice I have contacted customer services whilst they ask branch to investigate. In the meantime the branch has taken £250 out of my bank account using my debit card that was used for the £250 security deposit in October. I managed to stop them taking another £54 from my credit card. I am beyond impressed with them. A hire before this one took 4 months and 4 phone calls and visits to sort out incorrectly billed excess mileage- make sure you take pics on collection and drop of if you really want to risk using this cowboy company!!

In fact Europcar sent me three emails during the booking process (so the email address they have for me is clearly correct and not going to the junk folder) one to confirm the booking, one 3 days before reminding me to bring my driving license, and one literally 1 hour before the booking saying \"You're going to get the keys at Oxford and you're ready to hit the road\"!!\nIf you need a van ad-hoc and are willing to try again another weekend, then go for it, but if you need it as part of a bigger plan, maybe find somewhere a bit more reliable."

The guy at the counter (Chris) did the paperwork and told me not to worry if I couldn't get back early Monday as they knew I had a 3-4 hr d I've back. On the Monday I got back to the branch around 2:30pm the same guy was there again on the computer he took the keys and said don't worry I'll check it back in for you. This all seemed fine until I was expecting my deposit back. I had the full amount to hire the car pending in my bank (hire & deposit) when all of a sudden it came out of pending and all I got back for my deposit was just over £20. I knew this was wrong as I filled the tank back up before dropping her car off. I knew I was owed around £250. When It didn't go in when I thought it would, I got in touch with them about it (which is also a near impossible task as they never seem to answer their phones it took ages). I was told then that because the car was late back they had taken an extra day off us. We told them the car was returned in plenty of time and what we were told at the desk. After some back and forth calls this Chris admitted he booked it in late and he had to fill in a form to get the money back and it would be sorted as it was his mistake. Ok I thought it's been sorted so waited again. It got to the 28th of November still no money back again I contacted them and was told the form was sent off now it's down to head office to approve it. I then took it upon myself to ring head office the person was rude and said that what I'd had back (£20 previously) was all I was getting and that's it. Now I'm mad 😡 I tried the branch again and after a lot of back and forth again was told now the office definitely have the paperwork and it just needs to clear and go into my bank. It is now the 9th December they have had my money for nearly a month, they are gaining interest on it and I'm out of pocket. I need the money back as it's Christmas and it will help. I really feel like they are taking me for a fool and they have really taken the P*** . Again trying to get in touch with them to no avail no one answering my calls please people if u can use another company or make sure when you take the car back that it's checked straight back in or you will have the same problem as me 😡😡😡"

This Irene has no idea how her denial and refusal will impact business.\n\nEUROPCAR FAILED IN ITS DUTY OF CARE BY LEAVING A 63 YEAR OLD FEMALE STUCK ON THE M3 HARD SHOULDER IN THE DARK BECAUSE I DIDN'T RECOGNISE THE STEERING ASSIST ICON, NO HAND BOOK AND COULD NOT GET HELP FROM EUROPCAR.\n\nI'm now going to cancel my reservation from Dec 19 to Dec 22 and go to Enterprise.\n\nI called 999. They told me to call AA.\n\nIn response to the reply from Europcar.\nI sent all info to the CEO office. Someone named Irene replied. She made excuses. She missed the point that there was no one from Europcar answering my calls, despite my calling the 800 helpline.\n\nI'm filing a complaint with Financial Ombudsman and another agency\n\nYour link in your reply cannot be clicked on."

      "text": "I had a very frustrating experience with Europcar car rental company in Salzberg airport and poor support service from UK team too. When I returned the car at their centre in Salzburg airport, I was explicitly told that there were no additional payments to be made. However, I was shocked to later see that I was charged nearly €200 for cleaning, despite the fact that I had thoroughly cleaned the car before returning it and there was no mention or in the contract about any cleaning charges.\n\nWhat made the situation even worse was that they didn't inspect the car in my presence, even though I specifically requested it. It felt like they took advantage of the situation and slapped on an unfair charge without any justification.\n\nIt’s incredibly frustrating when a company gives you false assurances and then tries to impose arbitrary fees without transparency or accountability.\nI won’t be using this rental service again and would advise others to be very cautious before renting from Europcar & contact your credit card company after the rental return to put a block on Europcar before they steal your money."

I realized this once the purchase had already gone through, I tried to cancel it but they weren't interested in helping me after I had handed over my money.\n\nMy complaint was ignored for two weeks before they sent me a canned response that the signature on the document was binding and this eliminated the possibility of a refund. I am now in the process of filing a complaint with an external regulatory body over their dishonest sales techniques.\n\nI ended up paying for unnecessary insurance that cost more than 150% of the car rental itself. No one would agree to this. Please be careful of this company's deceptive sales techniques, don't let them convince you that you need to give them more than you already have. Don't sign anything unless you're certain you understand what they are telling you. And be aware that you will likely not receive help from this company once they have received your money.\n\nUPDATE following the below response - Europcar has flatly denied my request for an investigation or a refund, requiring me to escalate the issue to a third party.\n\nI will never use this company again."

He rushed me to sign the so called standard form and directed me to take the car as there was another client behind me.\nA few day later I received the mail with a very unfortunate surprise, I was charged £30 + Vat for an extra total of £299,88. That added to my paid booking for a Citroen C3 Aircross makes a total of 463,49 (this makes the daily rate £66,21)!!\nThis is a scam. Please note that a Mercedes from Europcar starts around 34/35£ a day. I wonder what car costs around £66 /day!!! This is scam and the company refused to review the complaint.\nI strongly suggest to avoid accepting any upgrade from this company as they will in some way they will trick or deceive you.\nNever again Europcar.\nAnd it is pointless to contact your customer service, as I did immediately after two days of rent and again twice after I returned the vehicle. Always the same reply which obviously invites me to contact and recontact the “useless” customer service."

He told me to email them in, he did not come out and sign them off. I emailed the marks/crapes in together with photos. On my return the agent checked the car and then told me that there was a fresh scrape on the alloy. I had to go down on my hands and knees to see it. I advised him that I did not do this. As the shuttle bus was waiting for me I left immediately, Within an hour 189.99€ + 18.88€ was charged to my card. I asked for the science behind the comment 'it looks fresh\".

When I actually got a van I rented through Enterprise, the experience was completely different, I actually got a van, very friendly staff and the van was in excellent condition."

      "text": "Hired a small, cheap car (eg Fiat 500) via Easyjet from Europcar, Glasgow Airport from 21 to 25 November 2024.\nOn arrival at Europcar woman in reception who dealt with me stated that the car had been upgraded at no extra cost, implying that upgrade had already been done. She asked me to sign rental forms, I believed what she told me and did not read through all the details as I had been travelling since 02:00 that morning.\nI received an invoice on 26 November stating that an extra £142.80 will be taken from my card for the upgrade. I was shocked and disgusted by this, as the employee had stated the upgrade was free and made no mention of extra charges.\nThe staff dealing with the actual vehicle at collection and return were excellent, but the woman in reception lied to me.\nI will never use Europcar again!\n\nUpdate: 3/12/24. Almost impossible to contact Europcar, had to use email address webmaster at europcar.com after their online contact form failed to work over several days. Customer Services are a joke, after several days received a reply stating: ' I wanted to take a moment to express our heartfelt gratitude for taking the time to share your positive feedback regarding our services. Your satisfaction is incredibly important to us, and we are thrilled to hear that we met your expectations.' WHAT! If my review and information sent to them was positive, what does it take to be negative? They are covering up for an employee who lied to me and not engaging in any way with my complaint. Absolute rubbish, avoid at all costs!!!"

      "text": "We rented a car from Europcar at Gatwick Airport during the summer. Unfortunately, the vehicle we had booked and paid for was unavailable, and we were provided with a substitute. This was the first indication that things were not going smoothly.\n\nDespite having paid in advance for insurance, we were informed there was an additional hidden fee for coverage, which was an unexpected and unwelcome cost. We had budgeted for the trip assuming everything was prepaid, so this extra charge forced us to adjust our finances.\n\nWhile returning the car, an object was thrown from the vehicle in front of us on the motorway, striking the windscreen and causing a chip. At the rental depot, we informed the agent of the incident, providing details of the time and location, and offered to file a police report to address the situation. The agent dismissed our offer, advising that there was no need for a report, as nothing would be done about the chip. Trusting their advice, we proceeded to catch our flight home.\n\nMonths later, we were surprised to receive a charge for the windscreen damage, as there was no third party to claim from. Had we followed through with the police report, as we initially offered, this situation might have been avoided.\n\nIn summary, we strongly recommend caution when renting from Europcar UK. From hidden fees to aggressive upselling tactics, it seems they are more focused on extracting additional charges after the rental is complete. Our experience left us disappointed and frustrated."

When I arrived to pick the vehicle up they did not have a Berlingo, only a Renault Traffic which is 2.4m high. Given the time and short notice I needed the van for the Nottinghamshire pick up so had no choice but to accept it, but I was unable to use it for the photography course and ended up borrowing a car for this. The vehicle was more expensive on diesel and more costly for the Dartford Crossing. Having returned the vehicle I complained to Europcar's central tel number only to be told that the Traffic and Berlingo are \"similar\" and they refused to consider my issue. In fact on Europcar's vehicle specification pages the Traffic is 2ft taller and at least 1ft wider. How can these be considered \"similar\"? No wonder their trust pilot ratings are so poor."

      "text": "This June I have reported I am in danger and the car I have renting from them is in danger too.Because I was challenging suspicious people, we can call them criminals wearing fully black clothes, shoes and SKI MASKS (end of June in 20 degrees) after midnight on the street in a posh area. (I am not writing every details down for a good reason ) They tried to damage the car that I was driving because I called the police on them and that was definitely an action which prevented one or multiple crimes that night. Later the police arrived and those criminals did hide and they lost they torch during they ran away. Following morning the neighbours told me around 5days earlier late night criminals are broke into someone's garage and many things were stolen and caused insane material damage. Where I found them it was the same location where the crime happened earlier.\nI wanted to protect the Europecar's and other citizens belongings from those criminals when I challenged them, but they did not appropriated I called the police and I disturbed their criminal activities that night so they tried to damage the car during I was driving. So after I asked help from Europcar, my prize was: a terminated contract that I did not know until it was discovered later by accidentally.\nHow's my torture started?\nI called the branch I told them what happened and what the police advised... I requested to swap my car regarding these serious facts. I had a call back from a female staff from Bristol Airport Branch a bit later who said I cannot get a different car and denied to give me her manager name that she referred to as a person who made this decision.I raised complaint later on that day via phone and the complaint team found their actions unprofessional.They asked me to send them the police log number that shows this was a real action. So, I have sent them via email and they said they will investigate it.\nI was not able to go back to that area with the car I am driving because the police advised me to don't do that, regarding the potential revenge of these criminals. Needless to say how hard was that day and night with these difficulties. Insane pressure on me either physically in danger, the car I have responsibility for also in danger and this was a huge psychological pressure for me... Terrible experience just because my safety and the car was not important for them.\nFollowing day (day after my request was refused by the airport team) I went to a different brunch with a hope they will give me a different car, but there we faced with a shocking fact, they discovered the car I am driving is not even contracted with me, that's meant I must not drive it. He advised me to go back to the Bristol Airport team and asking from them why is this car that I am using is not contracted with me. After my arrival to the Bristol Airport team they also confirmed face to face (not just one, two people) they will not give me a different car just because I AM IN DANGER AND THEIR CAR IS IN DANGER TOO. Yes,not their problem if I will be stubbed or end up in a hospital also if something happens with the car. I will need to pay for that damage anyway so that's not a problem for them.I am just a walking bankomat that's needs to pay and pay....\nAfter they stated this I told them I will be back tomorrow and I will bring the car back because they did this with me and I told them anyway the car is not contracted with me. I started to walk away but one of the member asked the reg.number to check why the other branch member said the car I am driving is not contracted. He found out why is my name not registered with the car. This reason was:\nbecause 28 hours earlier a different staff member (who denied to give me the manger's name and said they will not swap the car) terminated my contract. They also told it cannot be by mistake because this is a process to make it done,not just one red button to push. So, the person who discovered this problem said this is serious and he called a different brunch reached out a member there who can backdating/modify the contract. Yes, there is a man who knows the system very well and they calling him to make things to disappear , 'modify' in the system. So, the 28 hours of gap evaporated from my rental history. How do I know this? Because the Europcar stated multiple times there is no gap in my rental history and that gap is disappeared, I saw this with my eyes. However it was there before I have many different evidence for that. So, because of the terminated contract that he found,I couldn't drive the car that I am arrived with, so I had a different car from that night. And when I told him the stop start system is not working properly he just said \"this is MG\"\nNeedless to say, this is going to different social media platforms and I do work on it to publish in different news too plus goes to legal way to get my compensation for this long torture."

Upon arrival, I was offered a “free upgrade.” Tired after a 19-hour flight and being unfamiliar with the detailed terms, I trusted the salesperson’s assurances and signed the agreement. To my shock, I later discovered I was charged £847, including fees for services and upgrades I was never informed about.\n\nThese charges were not transparently explained during the transaction. While I acknowledge my signature, I believe this was obtained under misleading circumstances. The salesperson’s failure to disclose critical information left me feeling taken advantage of.\n\nI reached out to Trip.com to dispute these charges, but the resolution was unsatisfactory. Despite presenting my case, the charges remain, with no acknowledgment of their lack of transparency.\n\nUnfortunately, I am not alone. After my experience, I found several similar complaints about Europcar’s unclear practices, such as:\n\nTripAdvisor Review of Europcar Heathrow -\n1. “Scam Upgrade from Europcar!!”\n2. \"Scammed for Extras fees\"\n3. \"Reddit Post on Europcar Issues - Europcar Heathrow Rental Scam\"\n\nMy intent in sharing this review is to warn future customers. If you choose Europcar, I strongly recommend documenting every interaction, asking for detailed explanations of all fees, and carefully reviewing the agreement before signing. Transparency and trust are essential, and unfortunately, my experience with Europcar fell far short of this standard."

      "text": "Picked up a car from Almería airport in October. Had loads of damage on it ranging from scratches in almost every panel and a cracked binnacle.\nLots of damages declared on pick up. Took loads of photos. Sent them to them. Returned car back in same state.\nBack home for five weeks now and they’ve charged me over £600 for damage. No notification. No invoices. No proof of any damage done by me. Absolutely nothing. Nobody inspected the car when I picked it up or dropped it off. It’s cheaper that way for them having to employ people to check them in your presence. Just a sneaky charge on my credit card. Seems to me they bill everyone for damage, and never fix any of it. Basically the customer actually paying for the car they rent out.\nThe car had over 50k on the clock. It’s clearly a well used car.\nTo be honest, there was that many scratches and dents on it, it was hard to match up what there was on the paperwork.\nNow I’m going through the pain of trying to get it back through my credit card.\nNothing but crooks. They may as well dipped their hand in to my wallet.\n***update-***\nI challenged this charge and they come back to me with a refund. They haven’t actually told me what I was being charged for and they took over £600. It’s now taking up to 12 working days to refund it. If you ever hire a car, take pictures of ANY damage. No matter how small. Or how much. If there’s a lot reject it. (I should’ve done this). This car had so much damage on it, it was hard to distinguish what they actually declared. Mainly small dents , scuffs and scratches. And make sure you email them as soon as possible with the damage. Luckily I sent mine within 24 hrs and they had a time stamp which they asked for again. Hirer beware. Would even be advisable to take pictures when you hand it back to save any grief. Like the two weeks I’ve had dealing with this.\nGoldcar is next door to them in the terminal. I’m going back to them next time in Almeria.\nIf you honestly don’t contribute to any further damage and they bill you weeks later (like in my case) challenge it. I can’t believe I’m the first and won’t be the last.\nGood luck and happy holidays. This put a sour taste to the end of mine."

      "text": "I rent cars on a regular basis all over the world and my experience with Euopcar has been one of the most disappointing I have ever had. I feel like they have ripped me off by using a bait and switch on my chosen vehicle.\nOn perusing one of the aggregator websites,I was drawn to Europcar who were advertising a Mercedes GLA. The price was towards the higher side but I selected it as this is a vehicle I am specifically interested in.\nNot unsurprisingly, there was none available when I arrived to collect my vehicle. I was told that they don't actually rent out the Mercedes GLA, as it is soley used as a standby/emergency vehicle for when one of the other Mercedes products breaks down. That means that they never intended to rent the advertised vehicle and then they hide behind their T&C to provide another vehicle.\nTo add insult to injury, the \"other\" vehicle turned out to be an Audi Q2. This car is not even close to being in the same league. In fact, you will not see the Q2 advertised on their website because they would have to attach a publically visible value to it, which would reveal their malfeasance. Of course, all of this is allowed under their T&C and they remain the final arbiters of what is fair...\nTo be fair, their staff were friendly, pick up and drop off were straight-forward - pretty much a vanilla experience apart from the fact that they provided me with a cheap and nasty substitute vehicle."

Was left stranded on a bank holiday and had to arrange recovery myself. 6 months later received a letter from a solicitor asking for payment of a £1028.53 charge. I contacted Europcar who has failed to send any correspondence to me despite having me phone, email and address. They refused to share the itemized bill for repair from the dealership who provided the new key. Stating I only have access to the bill from them. No proof that it cost Europcar £1028.53 for a replacement key. Shortsighted. I now use Hertz regularly even when the quote is higher and I've had zero issues from them."

      "text": "I am a Motability customer and have had to have 3 ev loan cars from this company in the last 6 months due to ongoing issues with my Motability vehicle. No problem with the 1st car I had from them BUT, the last 2 bookings have gone disastrously wrong:\n\nThe 2nd car, an EV, had a faulty battery which wouldn't hold its charge and consequently had virtually no range.\n\nAfter approximately 4 hours of continuous calling and timed-out disconnections, I finally managed to get through to someone at Europcar who advised it couldn't be replaced until the AA had been called out. I was supposed to be transferred to the AA however I was just routed back to the main Europcar switchboard and had to wait a further 40 minutes before I spoke to someone. I asked for a direct number and eventually managed to get through to the AA, who then advised that they wouldn't be able to sort the battery issue and that I needed to re-call Europcar. After some negotiation and having explained Europcar's refusal to replace without a mechanic's report, the AA agreed to have a mechanic call. He duly arrived and advised the car needed to go back to Europcar for repair. He called Europcar, advised them that he was from the AA and that the car needed replacing.... they told him they couldn't help and that he needed to call the AA!!!! He was shocked. Between us, we agreed to drive down to the (Exeter City) branch to try to sort something out. Again, after some negotiation they agreed to provide another vehicle, however they wouldn't have a suitable car until later that day. They promised to call me when it was available so that I could drive back down and collect it that day. I NEVER received a call back. I attempted to contact the branch direct for updates on its availability later in the day, but they just picked up the phone and immediately put it down again. I ended up having to drive down to the branch the following day - fortunately the replacement vehicle was on the forecourt. I challenged the member of staff on duty about the lack of communication. He could not offer any reason as to why I hadn't been contacted and was totally unapologetic for all of the inconvenience, stress and anger Europcar's inactions had caused. NB the replacement car provided was also damaged.\n\nThe 3rd car - I'll keep this brief.....! What Car? Europcar were notified at the beginning of the month that I would need a car for today, 18 November. I got a call from them 3 days before to discuss my needs, and was advised that ev cars were in short supply but that they should be able to source something and would let me know. Guess what - no contact from them and I ended up calling them this morning. Something must have been wrong, as I only had to wait 15 minutes before connecting with the branch, who actually answered this time without putting the phone down immediately. They advised that Motability had contacted them to cancel the contract due to \"a lack of suitable vehicle availability\". They LIED - I contacted Motability RAC who checked their records and advised that it was EUROPCAR who had cancelled, not them. The RAC then took new details, and I am now waiting to hear back from Europcar for a new loan car. This of course, has directly impacted on not only me, but the dealership as they now do not have a car to repair.\n\nThis company is APPALING and I'd suggest that anyone looking to hire a vehicle avoids Europcar like the plague."

      "text": "From start to finish, one of the worst experiences with a company I have ever had. It's hard to know where to begin to be honest, but suffice to say I will never, ever, be using Europcar again.\n\nFor a start, I was give a completely different car to what I ordered. I prefer a smaller car for easier parking and I was pressured into taking a fairly large SUV. Generally the experience with the car during the rental was ok. However, when I returned it, there was no one around and no spaces in any of the bays. There was one space in another company's area, but of course all the bays were tiny (although the same as Europcars) and I struggled to park it, which was an unbelievably stressful experience.\n\nTwo weeks later, I was sent an invoice for £331!! According to Europcar I left a scratch on the car (which I didn't see at the time and to be honest, I'm still skeptical it may have occurred by someone else moving it because when I called up the next day after returning the car the Europcar rep said everything was fine and the charge on my credit card was dropped).\n\nFurious about the whole situation, I complained and was told an investigation was underway. For several months I heard nothing, and assumed it had been dropped. Only to then receive an email from their solicitors requesting the money, with a £40 late fee and an order to pay within 14 days or risk legal proceedings. Of course I have tried and tried to find a solution via email and on the phone, but in the end it's like talking to a wall so I decided to pay the invoice to avoid this dragging on any further.\n\nNow I am in trouble because my cover only reimburses cases if their claim is made 45 days from the day of the rental. This is a separate company, but this situation would have been avoided had they contacted me about the investigation earlier.\n\nAs said, this has been truly awful and this review barely scratches the surface. I feel completely robbed, and mistreated but I suppose they don't care because they have their money."

Upon delivery, they didn’t give me a full tank of fuel when it comes to collecting the vehicle the car had 20 miles less than when it was given to me but this is due to the fact that on the Friday, I had planned to go and put £10 in to take it up to what it had when they delivered the vehicle but they had then informed me the vehicle was uninsured. I wasn’t able to get hold of a Jerry Can I tried multiple times. Not much I can do the do expect risk being caught driving with no insurance. I explained this to the man and he said that’s fine. I will explain. I then wake up on the Saturday to find they had took A full tank of fuel out of my account and they wasn’t even concerned that they had cancelled the insurance basically saying to me that I should have drove the vehicle uninsured when at the top of my road there is an ANPR camera that would’ve flagged no insurance and they would’ve been quick enough to send the police to my door disgusting behaviour considering it was a courtesy car whilst my mums mobility car was off-road. They would’ve been happy for it to fall back on my shoulders driving uninsured meaning I could have potentially been put on a driving ban or worse time in jail. I will be lodging a formal complaint. This is just that everyone knows that you like to cancel insurances. By the looks of it it is an shocking company with really bad reviews so I’m not overly surprised to be honest with their behaviour, if I could avoid using them I would, but unfortunately mobility only work with them so in need of a replacement vehicle I am stuck with them"

      "text": "It’s a shame because the pick up and four days of hire were great. Customer facing staff at branch were also friendly both at pick up and drop off. It is what has happened after drop off which I can only suggest borders on criminal. So far a payment authorisation each week of £139 has been taken against my debit card after returning the van two weeks ago. I can only suggest that they continue to use the initial card authorisation I gave them when approving the deposit to be held. Their representatives can’t see why they would be taking this amount each week as there is nothing on the rental agreement suggesting they should but it doesn’t stop it from coming out of my account and depleting my available funds somewhat illegally. I have had to open a case and been asked to send them statements so that they can investigate. In addition to this they also tried to charge for fuel when I had filled it up just before dropping off which the chap at the drop off desk reminded me to do. No exaggeration the petrol station is next door as they share the car park. They have since said a refund is coming back to me for this due to “lack of documentation” but it’s pretty shameful that someone thought to try it on to start. Fingers crossed they sort the weekly illegal card authorisations without me needing to cancel my cards with the bank."

A few days after I dropped the hire car at the garage, Europcar finally collected it and yet did not mention any damage, in fact they sent a video they took on collection and the car looks fine *although having compared their footage to mine, they had taken the video after driving it as the fuel gauge was slightly less than as I left it.\n\nThe notification from Europcar was sent by text message and there is no option to reply.\n\nA call to their customer services ended up with someone in Morocco who refused to clarify what the damage apparently is, stating it is not relevant, they also refused to put me through to a supervisor or manager or arrange a callback from them. I felt entirely at the mercy of someone who simply told me they were investigating!\nEither this is a scam or Europcar are attempting to charge customers for unspecified 'damage' to vehicles, weeks after they are returned!"

An arranged hire car through motability was delivered to me at the dealership which quarter the fuel tank had been used when I received it. No paperwork or anything was signed. She handed keys, I took photos of the car as proof there was scrape marks on the vehicle already. The woman who delivered it seemed a little edgy. I used the hire car a handful of times and then filled it back up to where it was when I handed the keys. I dropped it at the dealership and the recptionist told me she would arrange the collection for me and she took the keys off me. A WEEK later I had notification It had been collected by Europcar. They then billed me for £30 fuel used!! I disputed this but then became too tired to continue and paid it, stupidly. Now 2 MONTHS later they have filed a claim against me for damage to the vehicle!! I am being chased for £100 excess for damage I DID NOT do. The damage in question was already on the vehicle when I was handed the keys. I took photos of the car when I dropped it off and uploaded them onto the Europcar link they had sent me. So they DO have the photos before and after showing the exact same damage already there and no further damages. UNLESS, the dealership had caused damage between the week of me dropping it off and Europcar collecting it. Either way, I did NOT cause any damage what so ever, or the delivery woman damaged it on the way to dropping it off as apparently no damage was recorded before I had it. convenient!!! I refuse to pay for someone elses damage. NOT a chance. I will take this all way the way and as far as it goes. They uploaded their own images and I uploded my images to them. So they have the images I sent them regardless. They are liars, unprofessional money grabbers preying on motability customers. DO NOT ACCEPT EUROPCAR HIRE."

The following Monday I had to drive from my home in Cornwall to Gloucestershire with my cat who was going to a specialist hospital for treatment, while I stayed nearby in a B&B.\n\nEuropcar Truro texted me on the Monday saying that my hire car would be delivered between 12 and 2. I had bee trying to call them all morning to bring it forward as I had to be in Gloucester by 5pm. They don’t answer this phones. They don’t even play music or have a message telling you that you are in aqueue….they just play you an advertisement over and over.\n\nMy insurance company did manage to contact them though, and Europcar called me shortly before 2pm. They told me that an MGHS has bee booked out to me and was on its way. This car never arrived. I then received another text saying that my car would be with me between 3 and 5. Shortly before 6pm the driver turned up with the smaller MGZS. I wasn’t able to fit all of my luggage plus cat crate into this so I had to leave some things behind.\n\nReturning the hire car is proving to be similarly difficult., largely because EuRopcar never answer their phones. I tried to call them several times during the week to talk to the about the return, but they don’t answer. As I am typing my insurer is also attempting to contact them. The have promised to call the, back, but that was over an hour ago. If I can’t return the cat today I am going to have to pay for another night at the B&B and another night for the cat at the veterinary hospital. I have also tried to call the Bristol branch to see if I can drop the car off there but they don’t answer either, and after 20 minutes of listening to their advent they cut you off with a message that just says “ sorry there is no one here to answer you call”.\n\nThey treat human beings with contempt. I am disabled and things like this have a very negative effect on my physical health. I hope that NFU Mutual and other car insurers will stop using them. Had I known that they would cause me this many problems I would have hired a car from somewhere else at my own expense."

After the closure was lifted, we were not able to ignite the car again. This was some time around 8 pm. After calling the Europcar service, it took 2 hours for the technician to arrive. Apparently the immobilizer was active, some kind of software malfunction, happening for reasons not even he could explain. We were ready to go again some minutes before midnight, lost therefore our hotel reservation, where check in was till 10pm only. Our flight back home was the next morning and since we were scared this might happen again, we decided to return directly to Edinburgh Airport spending the rest of the night (arrival time was after 1am) at the parking lot. Needless to emphasize the inconvenience caused.\n\nDue to this, it seemed adequate to ask for a refund for the caused trouble, since if any fault is caused by the costumer Europcar would not hesitate to bill the extra expenditures. But all we got offered was a lousy 10% discount on our next booking. An offer like this + the fact, that europcar is expanding its fleet with low quality chinese cars will make us seriously rethink renting anytime again from Europcar.\n\nI for myself cannot recommend renting with them."

At the car return they said we cannot help but contact head office again and you will get a refund.

Not trustworthy at all!\n\nEuropcar responded by suggesting that I give them \"a chance to solve the issue\" by contacting their customer service. This is their standard response and sounds good - except I have already exchanged several emails with their customer service dept - they started off offering to help, but in the end said they would not refund the money wrongly charged.

I got home 11hrs after I was meant to and €538 poorer (€437.48 on the new flight and €101 on the taxi home. Through absolutely no fault of my own, and ENTIRELY the fault of the faulty car that Europcar hired to me, I spent €538 and was 11 hours delayed, and they wouldn't compensate me for the cost? How is that fair? They gave me €39 for the car hire and offered NO EXPLANATION FOR WHY. Absolutely fuming. Disgraceful disgraceful company."

      "text": "The original problem with Europcar happened May 18 but was in conjunction with Mercedes and carried on for 5 months. Europcar had a simple task - to deliver a hire car to a Mercedes dealership in Pembroke where we waiting as our car needed attention. All agreed at noon and advised ETA of 14-20 pm. No car had arrived at 15-30 so obviously called to enquire. Told that they would contact the driver to confirm ETA. The news was somewhat baffling - no car had been dispatched and this was down to Mercedes not approving the order. Their suggestion was that a taxi would take us to Swansea - a trip of say 2 hours - and we could then drive back to our hotel - another 90 mins. We obviously declined the offer and our hire car eventually arrived at our hotel Sunday mid morning. Over the next 5 months dealing with Mercedes Benz Customer Service, it became very clear that the excuse about the non arrival of the car being down to MB was a complete lie. So Europcar came up with another excuse. That also was a complete lie. But good luck to Europcar they just kept going and came up with another excuse this time blaming us that our credit card details had not arrived in time. Hey,ho in seconds we managed to send visual evidence that this third attempt was also a lie. In the end, MB after 5 months of deliberation finally, finally realised that they were being lied to and the case was\nsorted in our favour. In a way, I was a little disappointed when it ended because it was just fascinating to try and guess what Europcar would create as their next excuse. Bad ethics, no apologies - Europcar is a Company to avoid at all costs. There are lots of hire companies out there and my advise is to choose any other than Europcar. Very easy to see why their customer ratings are so low. Almost impossible to try and fathom why Mercedes has chosen them as a partner. Apologies for long note - cathartic...\n\nGot the standard response from Europcar giving me an email address to respond. Tried that and the address is blocked. You just could not make this stuff up. Total shambles..."

When I went to pick car up from Glasgow Airport branch I was scammed from the minute I walked through the door. The young chap with a beard didn't even want to see my car hire voucher as he said he had it on his computer. Asked what car I drove normally I said an automatic as I have rhymathoid arthritis but for a week I would only need a manual which I had booked. Told me he would give me an automatic at no extra cost as I had a disability also said my daughter could be an additional driver in case I wasn't able to drive while I was visiting family. I did sign a form after he said it was a holding deposit which would all be returned after I dropped car off( they took £903 out my account). He folded up paper and put into envelope I made a point in say you haven't charged me any extra have you as my reading eyesight isn't good. Reply not at all madam. Enjoy your stay, dropped car off flowing Monday 14th Oct . Next day I found out they had taken out £653 out of my account for upgrade, young driver addition my daughter is 25. I have complained and told that because I signed it's my fault. They have scammed me out of this money by playing on my disability and poor reading eyesight. So I have just paid £900 for a hire car for a week which is absolutely terrifying. I could have got taxis everywhere cheaper than this. It is shocking what people are prepared to do to vulnerable people who are honest and hardworking. Glasgow branch seems to be good at doing this. I will never use or recommend them ever again. If I don't get my money back I will contact watchdog and the ombudsman. Playing on someone's disability is shocking. If I could I would give them zero stars"

Charged for excess miles after inaccurate pick up miles recorded.\nNeeded to move furniture 2.45m in length. Booked a medium size van internal length 2.93m on website. Went on live chat to confirm that if it was a “similar van” it would still be the same internal length.\nWas told the length on the website was an error, but all their medium vans are 2.862m so it would be that.\nI was emailed less than 2 days before pick up, after free cancellation period advising the van was 1.75m. This was below the amount I needed so called customer services. They said this is an error and I would get the van I needed. Contacted the Norwich office to double check, they said it was extremely unlikely they’d have a van I needed, but would “upgrade” me to a larger van. The larger van was no use, as in excess of the maximum weight limit for my licence. This was initially dismissed, then accepted that this was correct, I was told I would get a smaller van. I asked to confirm that this would be a minimum of 2.5m in internal length, they said they couldn’t guarantee this. I explained that it has to be 2.5m or it’s not use to me. I was told they’d call me back. Six hours later following receiving no call back I chased. Was told they had managed to get a van and it would be 2.5m in length. A total of 7 calls and 45 minutes on the phone.\nPicked up the van fine, no issue with the van, it was 2.5m in length, although not the 2.862m I had initially booked. This meant due to the angle the seats came out at I needed to do an extra trip as the furniture needed to be on its back rather than on its side, so only 1 could fit at a time rather than 2. This added 2 hours and 45 miles to my day.\nI could have ignored all this, but to top it off.\nReturned the van and was emailed a statement of return. The pick up miles were incorrect. I contacted to explain and sent a photo as evidence. I was told that it didn’t matter as they hadn’t been charged. The following day I received an invoice confirming the charge for the miles which I didn’t drive."

I rang to report and emailed the photos but I’m in no doubt they would have tried to charge me for this if I’d not done so.\nI filled the car up on the day of return and dropped it off at Crewe Audi who made the booking, I took a date/time stamped picture of a full tank with 520 miles. I’ve now received an invoice for £15+ for 7 litres of fuel and when I’ve queried it they told me I’ve been charged for the fuel to get the car back to their Stoke on Trent branch!! Not sure why I’m responsible for this given it was returned with the same fuel level and they’ve also added their inflated petrol fee.\nAvoid this company and use Enterprise. If a dealership books a car through Europcar be sure to make the dealership take ownership or refuse it."

I very much doubt it will be repaired they just take the money. It really feels like I've been scammed. After over a month of emails in which all of their responses were callous and didn't answer my very polite questions, after already extorting 1500 euros, they are still taking more money from my credit card and I'm having to go to the ombudsman just to stop them after trying with the company for over a month. The ombudsman, the ECRCS, found they had mistakenly charged me VAT on the damage - Europcar then took another £1100 from my credit card without refunding me the first charge of £1382. Honestly I didn't find the ombudsman helpful, it felt like they were sponsored by the care hire company. Just don't use Europcar whatever you do they essentially are using any excuse to extort money and you are powerless to stop them.\nUnbelievable"

      "text": "One of the Most Stressful Car Hire Experiences I've Ever Had - I am all for the change over to electric cars, per say, but by choice and not on this occassion...!\nI recently hired a car from Europcar, and it turned out to be one of the most stressful experiences I've ever had. I originally booked a Vauxhall but, to my surprise, was given a fully electric Jeep instead. No one informed me of this change beforehand—there was no notice in my email or on the order. To make matters worse, I was charged an extra £35.\nWhen I arrived to collect the car, I was told there were no other vehicles available, and one of the staff rudely suggested I should just cancel my order. I had an important meeting over 220 miles away and had no choice but to take the car. I had no idea how it worked, and the staff didn’t have a clue either. They didn’t know how many miles I could drive or how to charge it, but they incorrectly assured me that 200 miles would be enough to get me to my destination.\nAfter just 30 miles of driving, and when I figured a couple of things out, I realized the mileage was dropping much faster than expected, and I found myself in a panic, with only 43 miles left and 35 miles to go to the nearest charging station. I called Europcar twice for help and was left on hold for 20 and then 35 minutes! I ended up having to call a local dealership to get information about charging the car, who were so helpful and supportive.\nDespite calling Europcar multiple times to ask for a different vehicle, I was told they couldn’t get through to other branches, and I didn’t have time to go hours out of my way to try Plymouth or Exeter locations. I was late to my meeting and to my hotel in Cirencester, which left me stressed and anxious.\nThe next day, the nightmare continued. The car was at 15% charge in the morning, but I had to drive slowly and risk running out of charge just to make it to my next meeting. Afterward, I drove to two charging stations that were both not working (Shell). I had to go to a third location, which took 20 mins to get to and an hour to charge, and I ended up driving in the dark—a situation that made me even more anxious. I didn’t get home until 9:45 PM, completely exhausted.\nI wouldn’t have rented this car if I had been told about the change in advance. The potential breach of contract, misrepresentation, lack of communication, rude staff, and complete lack of knowledge about the vehicle made this an awful experience. I felt unsafe throughout the journey, constantly worried about the mileage and being stranded with no charge. This hire wasted my time, energy, and money. Absolutely terrible service, and I feel upset by how badly this was handled and hope this can be redressed.\nEuropcar needs to seriously improve their obligation to customer service and communication. If you're thinking of hiring from them, I would advise you to double-check your booking and be prepared for a lot of hassle.\n\nWould not recommend."

I was repeatedly passed between departments, faced poor communication, and was even given incorrect contact information.\n\nInconvenient Resolution: The only solution offered was for me to make a 5-hour round trip to exchange the vehicle, which I had to arrange on my own initiative.\n\nWhile a replacement vehicle was eventually provided, the process was arduous and disruptive.

They reluctantly gave it to me and after about 100 kms it broke down. I had to return 100 kms to Marseille to pick up a replacement even though there were other nearer branches. They again tried to offer me a Renault Mégane! After a long argument I was finally given an MG SUV. The counter staff were unbelievably rude and the final cost to me was nearly 40% more than expected.

At no point were we verbally made aware of any additional charges, nor were we made aware in the confirmation email that additional charges may apply for the additional driver, and when we asked about the breakdown of the costs on the rental agreement we were told \"this summarises what you've already paid\". Fast forward a week and an additional charge appears on my credit card for 28% of the original rental costs for the additional driver.\n\nWhen we've challenged the cost, despite not being made aware of the additional cost, it was included on the rental agreement and therefore Europcar are unwilling to refund. Why would these costs not be mentioned to us when we specifically asked their representative what the costs were? To add salt to the wound, the additional driver was just for an emergency, they didn't even drive the vehicle.\n\nIn the interest of customer service would you not empathise with the customer, understand the facts they have presented, and determine a miscommunication had occurred?"

Eight days ago, a reservation was made on my behalf by the Direct Line Motability team, but I am still without a vehicle. Despite this ongoing delay, it is frustrating to see that Europcar has vehicles available online for casual customers, allowing them to book and pick up cars at very short notice.\n\nThis raises serious concerns about Europcar’s commitment to Motability customers. It seems that Europcar is accepting reservations through the Motability team without actually having the vehicle stock available, while prioritizing casual customers who book online. This is not only unacceptable but reflects poorly on the company’s ability to serve those who rely on such schemes for their independence and mobility, particularly drivers with disabilities.\n\nThe lack of communication and transparency around vehicle availability, especially after waiting for more than a week, has caused significant inconvenience and stress. As a disabled veteran, reliable transportation is crucial for my day-to-day life, and this experience has greatly impacted my ability to manage my commitments.\n\nI strongly urge Europcar to address this issue, both in how they manage stock for Motability reservations and in how they prioritize these customers. It is unacceptable for vehicles to be available to casual customers while Motability customers are left waiting indefinitely.\n\nDarlington Branch"

However, after travelling for miles to collect the vehicle, we were told that our investigative journalist could not take the van because he wasn't on the electoral roll.\n\nWhy on earth would they allow us to proceed with the booking, travel such a long distance, only to turn us away upon arrival? It wasted an entire day, time we didn’t have to spare, all for nothing. Now, we’re left waiting for a refund that has taken days to process, with no van, no solution, and a serious disruption to our event plans.\n\nMy biggest regret was not checking the reviews on here first! Had I seen the experiences others have had, we would never have booked with Europcar in the first place. Thankfully, a local company stepped in last minute to save the day, but the way Europcar handled this situation was absolutely shocking. The lack of communication and care is beyond frustrating. I strongly urge anyone considering renting from Europcar to think again.

      "text": "I booked a car from Europcar Bristol Airport online on 12.04, as I needed a car short-term while sorting out transport. The full amount for the car was paid prior.\nThere were no concerns, until they did an address check. I have been at the address since August 2023, and it is on my UK license which I presented. Following a check I was told they could not rent the car following address check.\nAlthough it still makes little sense, it would've been fine if they did this before I paid the £350 online, and traveling all the way from Wales per bus to get the car."

      "text": "Note: Europcar is writing fake five-star reviews to offset all of the negative reviews it is receiving.\n\nMy experience...\n\nSave yourself the time and stress: take the rental you plan to give to Europcar, set aside around £20, douse the rest in gasoline, and set it alight. Use the £20 for public transport instead.\n\nI was foolish enough to rent a vehicle from them. I now realise this is not a reputable company but rather a rolling scam—a front for financial abuse masked as fair policy. Whatever you pay in advance, regardless of the booking mediator you use, rest assured, it won’t be the final price. The car you want won’t be available, the cover you obtain through a booking mediator will be ignored, and you’ll be charged for additional coverage (even if you insist you’re already covered).\n\nEffectively, here’s what will happen: you’ll arrive to collect the car you booked. Europcar won’t have it. They’ll offer you a shed on wheels and claim it’s similar to what you reserved. It won’t be. They will then offer an upgrade at an exorbitant rate, trapping you because you need a car to make your holiday work. Then, they’ll place a temporary hold on your card, and for weeks after returning the car, they’ll bombard you with invoices for additional costs at inflated prices.\n\nEuropcar is about as transparent as sandblasted glass covered in treacle."

      "text": "I have hired cars and vans from Europcar many times before and the last one was only 3-4 months ago . I again made a booking with them and received an email to upload my passport ,driving licence and take a selfie to complete check-in online . And shortly after that received another e mail as my checking completed and documents have been validated. When I went to office in Glasgow Lancefield Quay a gentleman call Sam asked my address details and asked my driving licence then said ohhh we did a soft credit search and we are not able to hire you a car . And then he advised me to speak customer service to explain situation and then I called them and the person I spoke on the phone diverted my call to a manager - I then find out he is the manager for their airport branch and he spoke to me on the phone and then he spoke to his colleague on the desk and speaker was on and I was able to hear . Once he started to be rude then his colleague put the speaker off !! Then I left the place with big disappointment as never had this before anywhere !!! So be careful before booking a car with them as they can confirm your booking online but once you arrive their office then they can say sorry we can't hire you a car !!! Doesn't matter you come from abroad and have important meetings, important events ,plans etc !!! All they care to cheat !!! I would never ever go with that company again !!! That's scam !!!"

A new Manager started a month or so back, and whole atmosphere has changed, refusing to extend when I’d never had issues before, grudgingly giving me a higher category car when they were short vehicles ( like he was doing me a favour) and today, TWO days after returning a car to Heathrow - and less than a month after finishing a three week rental with his branch, got rejected by ID /credit checks. Did NOTHING to solve the issue despite there being no issue 6 days ago. Could have resolved it if wanted to as staff do on a daily basis ( calling head office could have been one step) Now have to wait 3-14 days for refund. Went to SIXT at the station and 15 mins later was driving a rental from there. It’s called Customer Service.

      "text": "Please beware! Paid £1,400 for a £580 Europcar Rental: Misleading Deposits and Hidden Insurance Costs\n\nI initially booked a 2-week rental for what seemed like a great price—£237 in total. The pick-up process went smoothly, and I was asked to pay a “deposit,” which I was told would be refunded if the car was returned intact. However, at no point did the staff mention any additional costs beyond what I had already paid online.\n\nFast forward to the end of the two weeks—I needed to extend my rental, but it wasn’t possible. No big deal; I returned the car and booked another one for £343. This time, I noticed that they had sneakily added a £30 per day insurance premium. To my shock, this same hidden charge had been applied to my first rental as well, even though it was never communicated to me.\n\nNow, here’s the real kicker: the so-called “deposit” isn’t a deposit at all! They cleverly call it that to make you think you’ll get the full amount back, but in reality, they deduct the insurance charges from it. It’s a deliberate tactic to keep the insurance cost as hidden as possible until it’s too late.\n\nWhen I asked if I could opt out of the insurance, they refused to give me a car and would not refund the £300+ I had already paid. In the end, what was meant to be a straightforward car rental turned into a financial nightmare. For four weeks of car rental, I spent £580 on the online booking, plus an outrageous £800+ on insurance, bringing the total to nearly £1,400.\n\nIt’s clear that Europcar’s strategy is to lure customers with attractive online rates, and then, after you’ve paid the non-refundable fee, hit you with surprise insurance charges—last minute—leaving you with no choice but to accept. If insurance is mandatory, why isn’t it included in the advertised price so that customers can make an informed decision? This is blatant false advertising.\n\nEuropcar has lost me as a customer forever, and I strongly advise anyone to steer clear of this company. In all fairness, the cars themselves are clean and good, but their deceptive, scheming practices make for a truly awful experience."

      "text": "I picked up my car from Gatwick airport. I explained to the counter staff my exact requirements particularly that I didn’t want an expensive insurance policy. The young lad was helpful but immediately went off and returned with two Mercedes keys and told me I could have them instead at a discount. I told him that I wanted the car I had ordered but with the basic insurance. In the end that car wasn’t available so I had a free upgrade. So far so good.\nI repeated about my basic insurance requirements. He then went through the costs. I told him I didn’t want roadside assistance but he told me that was part of the package. I should have questioned him further on the package but he was nice and helpful so I signed the contract. Later when I read it closely I realised I had paid for premium insurance. I have now complained but have been told I have to wait until the hire has finished before I can complain. I now have the feeling the whole thing is a well rehearsed con to get the client to pay for higher insurance. Reassure the customer you have his best interests, focus on the free upgrade, gloss over questions on insurance and then stick him with premium cover. No doubt I will get no rebate later when I complain again.\nBottom line is to be very suspicious. If you suspect they are trying to cheat you they probably are."

I rang up and got comments like “turn the air-con off” “no cars available you will have to ring round other Europcar sites” and “nearest car is Manchester” several calls and hours later we were offered a smaller downgrade car.not suitable.\n3 months later I have still not had a response to question asked. I have been refunded the difference.\nThis company has shocking customer care. Reading the feedback they clearly don’t “Care”I went with Europcar as a reputable, large established company having cancelled a car with a smaller firm. This was a mistake.

We agreed to upgrading our insurance so that wasn’t a problem . They told us we were paying 480 pounds extra . It ended up being 1350 pounds extra so the price was almost $2000 pounds for 9 days which is ridiculous ! We took the car back 1 day early with no problems at all and have the invoice to prove it and they have taken another 1150 pounds out of my bank on the same day . I have emailed them lots of times and can’t get any help or refund . I cannot believe this has happened and am devastated as the amount is now 3000 pounds for 9 days hire !!!"

I have rented cars for over 45 years and have NEVER been scammed like this.\n\nOn arrival the woman at the desk tried to make me upgrade the car - making it appear that that was the one l been allocated (she already had the key on the desk infront of her). I refused and said l wanted the car l had booked.\n\nNext, premium insurance was added to my contract without asking me. As a result, l paid 150% more on my originally booking price. I have annual excess insurance and never use the rental company insurance went l rent.\n\nThey hid the fact that insurance was added by including it in the credit card excess authisation. Therefore, you are unaware that you have purchased insurance until your card is charged after the rental. Look at the reviews, many others have been scammed in this way.\n\nWhen I asked if the car had any damaged, l was told that it wasn't necessary to check it. On return, it was a different story, with the attendant checking the car minutely - going around it several times. In the end he found a very small scratch and l was required to sign off on the damage. I cannot say if the damage was already done when l rented the car. The scratch was so small l do not believe l would have noticed it ... and certainly not in poor light conditions.\n\nIf you use this company you should make sure that you photograph the whole car, including wheels, before you drive off.\n\nNever again!"

Why is the director of this company conncected to Bentley cars when i looked up companys house ? its time motability supplied each paying customer of motability with cars direct from the garage doing there repair . it is also time all people if they have a alergic reaction to something or need a service dog to supply cars to the disabled while there cars are being repaired without this threat hanging over them of having unlawful amounts taken from there accounts . Are motability and all garages including audi aware that under the equality act 2010 they are serving the public they are obliged to make arrangements to accomodate disabled customers . and that service and assistance dogs are used to help and make disabled peoples lifes more bearable in many different ways . and there is no test no colour of harness colour no paperwork or certificate and they should all be catered for and listened to . the system using diabolical companys needs to be ended now ."

Instead, there was a notice saying that the desk was closed and that they were operating from a cabin in the car rental car park at the opposite end of the airport!\nOn arrival at the new Europcar location I was asked for my license which I presented. I also offered to give them my passport and proof of address which they declined (said they didn’t need them)!\nAfter 10 minutes the person behind the desk asked me to confirm my address which I did, and I was then told that Europcar had declined my reservation and that they could not give me the car I had booked and paid for! In fact, they couldn’t give me any vehicle!\nWhen I sought clarification, I was told that their system had not been able to verify my address which by the way is on my licence and I also had additional proof of address with me but this was not acceptable as the “system had declined” my paid for in full confirmed reservation!\nI spoke to the manager who said he could do nothing nor could he refund the money I had already paid as it had been collected by AutoEurope and I would have to take it up with them!\nHe also astounded me with a tale of how Europcar was clamping down on who they hired cars to because some had not been returned and others had been used in robberies etc and as a result of these unacceptable comment and inferences I was left feeling as though I was some sort of undesirable crook!\nIf that wasn’t bad enough this whole experience caused me a great deal of embarrassment as it was done in front of other customers including the bit about cars used in robberies etc hence the clampdown on who Europcar would hire vehicles to!\nI again challenged them and said that I’d been hiring cars for more than 40 years including with Europcar and never had any problems and was then told that I was the 3rd person in a row who the system had rejected, and that the manager was going to raise a query in the company’s group chat to see if other branches were having the same problem. Not that this helped my situation!\nUltimately not only was I was unable to hire vehicle but I was also left stranded at the airport and had to take a taxi from the airport back to South Shields to pick up an alternative hire vehicle from a local car hire company before they shut at 1pm.\nThis whole experience has proved far from acceptable and its unlikely that I will use AutoEurope again despite having used them many times previously but I certainly will not be using or indeed recommending Europcar again, in fact quite the opposite – I strongly advise anyone thinking of using Europcar to think long and hard about it and certainly don’t assume that you have a confirmed reservation.\nBased on my experience, not only will it prove to be a costly exercise, but it’s also an experience you are likely to regret!\nIf by any chance you are foolish enough to try and book with Europcar than I strongly suggest you put an alternative back up plan in place too, because based on my experience you are more than likely going to need to fall back on it!"

At the airport counter, the agent informed me that since I already had insurance with full coverage, I did not need to subscribe to any additional insurance. I was also told that a deposit of 700 euros would be charged (something I was already aware of through the contract signed with e-Dreams). In good faith, I signed the required forms on the tablet (the amount indicated was £647, which I believed to be the deposit) and was given a document with the rental and payment details; nothing else was handed to me, nor sent via email (certainly not an insurance policy that might have raised some suspicions).\nAfter two months of waiting for the refund of what I thought was the deposit, I was informed, upon my inquiry, that no refund would be issued as the amount charged corresponded to the cost of the insurance I had supposedly subscribed to. Realizing I had signed a document without verifying that the amount (which was not specified) actually consisted of £100 for the deposit and £546 for the insurance policy (this was the final amount charged), I nonetheless filed a complaint with customer service. Their prompt response (only 21 minutes after my email!) stated that since it was impossible to verify what had been discussed verbally, only the signed document held any validity! It goes without saying that all the information regarding the costs and charges was written in such a small font that one would need not just a pair of glasses but a magnifying glass!"

      "text": "On the 10th of March 2024, I hired a vehicle from Europcar and returned it on the 11th of March 2024 with no issues raised at the time of return. I was surprised to later receive a damage report claiming that I had damaged the vehicle. This report contained my signature, but no damage was brought to my attention when I returned the car, nor was I shown any documentation or proof of the alleged damage at the time.\n\nIn an effort to resolve the matter, I sent several emails to your customer service team seeking clarification. However, the only responses I received were automated emails apologizing for the delay and requesting my continued patience during your investigation. Months passed without any meaningful communication.\n\nTwo months after the incident, I sent the following email to inquire about the status of the investigation:\n\n-----\nDear Customer Service Team,\nI am writing to you again to resolve the following issue. We have not received any communication except for two messages stating:\nDear Customer,\nThank you for your continued patience during our investigation.\nPlease accept our sincere apologies for the delay in responding to you, due to the nature of your query; it is taking slightly longer than usual. It is our aim to provide you a full and thorough resolution, including any necessary supporting documentation.\nWe would like to offer you our assurances that once the information we are seeking has been obtained, we will respond to you. In the meantime, thank you for your continued patience in regards to this matter.\nWe look forward to contacting you again in the near future.\nCould you please advise on the status of this issue?\n-----\n\nDespite my best efforts, this email went unanswered. Instead, I was contacted by Shakespeare Martineau LLP Clients Account, a debt collection firm, which was both intimidating and unexpected, given that no final resolution had been communicated to me regarding the alleged damage.\n\nIn August, I finally received a response from Europcar stating that \"a member of our team will review your query and reply accordingly.\" However, no action followed this, and on June 10th, I received another email stating that you would not be pursuing any third-party providers and would be billing me directly.\n\nAs you can see, I have received numerous conflicting and contradictory communications from Europcar throughout this process. This is not only highly unprofessional but also confusing and distressing.\n\nUnder the Consumer Rights Act 2015, I am entitled to clear and transparent information regarding any charges or claims made against me, as well as reasonable communication in the resolution of any disputes. Europcar has failed in this regard, breaching your obligation to provide services with reasonable care and skill as required under Section 49 of the Act.\n\nFurthermore, the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 outlines that it is illegal for companies or third parties to engage in intimidating or unfair practices. The involvement of a debt collection firm in this unresolved matter, without following your own procedures, raises concerns about the fairness of this process.\n\nI find it unacceptable that Europcar has escalated this matter to a debt collector instead of adhering to the process stipulated in your terms and conditions. I request that this issue be resolved in accordance with the law and your own procedures."

We were given a well battered yellow BMW with all damaged listed on the agreement, I double checked with the desk before we left. On return, as is the way we were in a dash to get to the airport. The guy looked at the wheel hub and said that's new damage. I said no look it's listed on the rental agreement right there its old damage, and gave him the agreement. Also told him I'd checked it with the guys it was listed before i took it out. HE DID NOT LOOK AT THE AGREEMENT AND KEPT OUR PAPER RENTAL AGREEMENT (my second mistake). My first being that i didn't think it necessary to take pictures of the damage as it was already listed and checked. He then took photos and put them on the release which he insisted I sign. I asked if he would verify with the pictures from previous hirers so he could see it was not my doing, he mumbled something which I assumed stupidly was a yes. Now two months later I've just received notification I will be required to pay for the damage. I regard this behaviour as down right dishonest and disreputable and will never hire from them again. Good lesson in how to ruin someone's holiday memories. Thanks but never ever again."

      "text": "********* ORIGINAL POST ***********\n9/25/2014\nBEWARE!!!! BEWARE!!!! You have been warned. Horrible experience with EuropCar UK. I rented a car through Booking.com. When we arrived, they told us they didn’t have the car that we requested/paid for prior and they were going to upgrade us. They upgraded all right. On top of the $700 we already paid through booking.com they charged another $1200. They told me the initial $700 was included in the $1200 so I only had a $500 upcharge. I asked why there was any upcharge since they did not have the car I booked. I was told because I reserved the car through booking .com and not through them it would not be a free upgrade that I could go back to booking.com and request a different car or upgrade to this one at a cost. I am standing at the airport with 4 other people and didn’t have many options at the moment so we elected to pay the difference for the upgrade. Little did I know they charge me $1200 on top of the initial $700 I had already paid. I was not aware of this until AFTER my trip. Now that the car was dropped off they charged me another $400 to replace a tire because there was a minor cut in the side of the tire. This is the same tire that had previous damage noted on the rental contract. Where the cut was and the size of it you could not see it depending how the car is parked. When I returned it the cut was in the 1:00 o’clock position on the tire and easily visible. If the car is parked with the tire between 4:00 – 8:00 o’clock position you can not see the defect. At any rate I was charged $400 to replace the tire that only had about 60% remaining tread left on the tire. All in all it was a horrible experience with them and I will never use them again.\n\n******** UPDATED **********\n9/29/2024\nReached out to their generic response. Let's see what they do about the issue.\n\n******** UPDATED **********\n9/30/2024\nResponse from Customer Service\nThank you for contacting Europcar Customer Services.\n\nI can confirm the rental station will offer additional optional products to our customers upon their arrival at the desk, to ensure they are aware of all the products and services available. It is then the customer’s decision to accept or decline the products offered to them.\n\nWhilst I appreciate you have stated that the upgrade charge was not agreed to, I would be unable to comment further as I was not part of the verbal discussion. When the two parties involved are providing conflicting information, I can only base my decision by the documented evidence available.\n\nAs the rental agreement and Additional Optional Products form have been signed, in acceptance of the product, the request for the charge to be refunded has been respectfully declined.\n\nRegards,\nOmar Amoifek"

After a flight, kids in tow etc etc, we took a video of the car upon collection just to show the current condition. Upon returning the car we also took a video and then dropped the keys in the box (again no staff to take the car back or inspect it). A week later im then charged for fuel, baring in mind the car had more miles of fuel than when i collected it. Then weeks later im sent an invoice for damages which you can clearly see were there on the video when we collected the car. This video proof is not good enough, they want JPEG photos and are still proceeding to charge my card £280- even though I have proven we did not cause the damage. This is morally wrong, it is ridiculous to expect someone to find the car, inspect every inch of it, then go an que back up at the desk to try and get an employee to help with kids hanging off you!\nWill never use Europcar again\n\n*****Update*****\nhave emailed the customer service as advised in the response to my review.

My flight was delayed last night so I called europcar to explain I was unable to collect the car whilst at the airport waiting for my flight that was delayed by 3 hours as the Glasgow office would be closed on my arrival and I would have to collect Saturday morning. Agent said they would send an email to confirm my call. Glasgow Europcar had my flight number and phone number. I stayed in a hotel that was a 3 minute walk to Europcar and when I arrived at 9.30am I was told they had given it away the their 1st customer of the day as they put me down as a no show. Agent was rude not apologetic and told me I would need to pay £400 extra for a premium car!! When I explained that I called their call center he told me to call them again as there was nothing they could do as they had already cancelled my booking without Informing me. I called the call center for them to say as I could not collect at 10pm the car was released and a refund given, I was not told this when I called from the airport waiting for my delayed 3 hour flight. Left me at Glasgow airport with no form of transportation for me to get to Inverness. Worst customer service I have experienced in a long\ntime!! If you can't get to your booked car due to no fault of your own and you have taken to steps protect your booking by calling the call center be prepared for your car to be cancelled and not to be informed until you go and collect.\nI will be putting in a formal complaint as I have not received my refund yet and I have had to find and extra £600 for a car from another company\nNo holiday treats for me or my family!!"

He offered full insurance, but I refused because I had insurance from the bank that issued my card. However, he insisted on buying Road Assistance Express. I agreed. It cost me 104,76 pounds( 9,17 per/day). Three hours later, on a very narrow road, we hit a rock with the left front wheel. The tire was punctured and flat. Of course, there was no spare wheel - a big hello to Mercedes-Benz with its B200! I called 0800 0280999, which was listed where I was looking for a spare wheel. It turned out this was impossible from my US phone! As it turned out later, the company's website listed a different number for non-UK phones - 0116 247 3228. However, this number was not listed in the agreement or anywhere in the car. This is simply outrageous! In the end, I got through. Explained the situation. It took almost a one hour(!) - endless waits on hold, interruptions, stupid offers to rate their work.... finally I was told that help was on its way. This was around 4:00 PM 17 September. NO ONE CAME OR EVEN CALLED before sunset at 7:20PM! I had to find a mobile tire repair shop and resolve the issues for 230 pounds. I am writing this the next day at noon. No one has called yet.

This was only recorded as pending on your account and not as a completed transaction. When the vehicle was returned, the full amount was reversed and was not converted into a transaction. The above amount would then be released back into your available balance. The number of days this would take is a banking process, not a Europcar one,and this takes around 3-10 working days to show on the account (up to 28 days for international transactions).\n\nIf your statement lists pending amounts separately, then the deposit amount should disappear from this list. Some online statements can show authorisations as debits, so again this should drop off and your available balance would increase. In either instance, you would not see a refund or credit in your list of transactions, as the deposit was not debited by us.\n\nI would like to offer my sincere apologies if this was not clearly advised previously and I thank you for bringing this to our attention.\n\nIf you require any further information regarding the deposit process, you can check our FAQ section on our website - >click here.\n\nI trust this information assists with your query.\n\n\nRegards,\n\nMaryam"

After waiting 1 week they replied saying that there was a mistake and they charged me \"1 additional day of hire plus licenses and fees due to an error\", so they refunded £15.82 for the overcharge. At that moment I was still confused why they haven't refunded the rest of the money, so I had to follow-up 2 times with them because they were not saying anything about the rest £52.38 pending to be refunded.\nThen finally they confirm that those 52 pounds are related to an upgraded added at the counter and that at the time of the pickup, there was added a \"Roadside Assistance Express.\"\n\nAt this moment I also realize that the agent basically did this intentionally because I didn't buy the full coverage insurance at the counter. I told the agent that I had my own private insurance and he stated that the private insurances from booking.com don't cover glass and wheels. I told him that it was an insurance with my bank and that it has full coverage, so it seems like in that moment he decided to add the Roadside Assistance Express and didn't me anything that this was an upgrade and that I had to pay £52.38 extra for it.\nIf he would have done that, obviously I would have say no because I have full private coverage insurance already for this.\n\nWhat did the agent do? He just told me to sign the Rental agreement in multiple corners of the paper on both sides and that's it. And then told me to put my credit card for the deposit. He also didn't mention the value of the total deposit and didn't say that he was charging me £700 for the non-insurance deposit and £52.38 for the Roadside Assistance Express. At that moment I would have also asked by there were 2 payments and I would have cancel it.\n\nThis is a very old school mislead sales tactic that should be claimed, but the customer service hasn't helped me further because I signed the agreement. The agent also signed the paper, but he didn't put his name, so I'm still waiting for a response from customer service to know the name of the agent who did this and file an official claim. What a terrible and disappointing experience."

They left a message saying the deposit payment hadn't gone through at 9am and to call this telephone number (they took the main payment okay) 4 hours later after trying to get through, as the King's X depot wouldn't answer their phones to me. Called customers services they tried calling Kings X and they didn't pick up to them either, then they pretty much told me there was nothing else they could do. Finally after speaking with CS for the umpteenth time they emailed them to call me. Later finally got a call and they said they were busy. No apology, missed time slot by 5hours for a business trip. Wouldn't use them ever again. This is a slimed down version of events. Really really poor company!\n\nOh and managers don't speak on the phone when you ask for one. It's below their pay grade!"

They mentioned that there was an error in the system which resulted in a duplicate charge for which they were trying to resolve. After a month of chasing, I finally got a refund but it was short by ~USD30. Raised a follow-up and was told that I needed to raise a new complaint. Raised a new complaint and after another month, was told that they have checked and everything was in order without explaining why they didn't repay me the full amount they accidentally charged.\n\nBottomline: This company may charge your card double and have you chasing for months to get your money partially back. Avoid at all cost.\n\nAlso, when you book a guaranteed model, what they really mean is you'll get a much shittier version of the car and a talking to at the counter of what \"guaranteed model\" means (spoiler alert: nothing)"

As I was about to drive to Manchester and back, I went to Sainsbury's and filled it up. It took 6 litres. All in all - as tracked by Google Maps - I had driven 445 miles in the car by the time I dropped it at Guildford Audi on Friday 6th September (8Days).I filled the car again at Sainsbury's. I have the receipts. Europcar charged be for 466 miles and an excess fuel charge of £13.39 for 6 litres. This is exactly the same amount I had to put in on delivery.\nSo Europcar are charging me for their delivery costs not for my use. I will never ever hire a car from Europcar again. They are rip-off merchants"

With Avis or Budget, CDW/LDW coverage means that the total cost of any damage to the car is waived — zero liability! But not with Europcar . . . their \"Medium Protection Plan\" just reduces liability to a maximum of £250, as I discovered when I returned a rental with a scuff to the alloy wheel. Yes that is in the fine print but it was not made clear when I picked up the car — in fact the agent encouraged me to take the additional tyre & glass protection to reduce liability — and when I returned the car the agent implied I would be covered. Subsequently, I got a letter from Europcar stating that I was financially liable for up to £250, after paying over £70 in protection coverage for a 2-day rental. Safe to say, I will avoid this company for any future rentals in favor of companies like Avis where waiver means waiver."

I booked the rental through a 3rd party comparison site and paid a deposit for the rental and was covered for some extras, such as environmental surcharge. On arrival at the rental centre we were in a queue for about an hour and when we got to the desk was greeted by a very pushy rep. The cost of the rental was not as per the original agreement and they had added on the additional environmental charge. The salesperson also tried to \"upsell\" me a Mercedes and additional insurance, which I declined, at which point his demeanor became more aggressive. I was also miss-sold a full tank of fuel on the understanding that I would only be charged for fuel I used. They also charged me over £400 for a tiny scratch on the bottom of the rear bumper which I must have missed on the initial inspection, however I do have insurance cover for this. Their business model is clearly to misrepresent the original displayed price and then aggressively sell or even miss-sell add-ons and I strongly suspect their staff are targeted and compensated based on these sales. I will never be renting from Europcar again and would urge others to think twice before using their services."

Essentially, when I returned the car, I parked it in the drop off bay, then headed in assuming we would do the check out report with the europcar person as it was within drop off hours, but the queue was HUGE, literally out the door into the street. I had work, so didn't get a chance to check out the car. They then sent me the email saying they found a small scratch to the alloy, that isn't covered, even though I got the highest insurance cover I was eligible for. I emailed to say that I didn't damage the car and if they had enough staff then we would have done the check out together, but they basically said that's not their problem and I will still be charged for the damage- despite escalating it.\n\n- I see their cutnpaste 'pretend to care' reply below.

      "text": "If renting a car from this company be VERY careful on collection to take detailed photographs of both the exterior and the interior. Check the car thoroughly before accepting it. Their employees cannot be trusted to list all existing defects and you may be found liable for them later.\nDo not believe the person handing you the keys when they say that there is only, for example, one item of minor damage on the rental agreement. I recently collected a car, was told that there was only one item of damage: a chip on the windscreen. When I checked over the car before leaving, I saw that there were scuff marks on the wheels but assumed that as it had not been mentioned this constituted usual wear & tear. The car hire rep was dealing with another customer. I am not a mechanic, nor an employee of a car hire company, to know what constitutes acceptable wear & tear or unacceptable damage. I accepted that he could do his job. A few days later I returned the car in the evening after the office had closed so did not see a car hire rep. 2 days later I was very surprised to receive an email stating that there were 5 items of 'new' damage. One of these was chipped paint on the edge of a door, something that would have been hard to see. The car hire rep had opened all the doors and taken detailed careful photographs. What a pity the same care had not been taken when the car was prepared for hire. I was lucky that my photographs showed all the ‘new’ items of damage to be pre-existing. The car hire company puts the onus on the customer to inspect the car (in detail). Their T&Cs state that “if you don’t notify us of pre-existing defect or damage to the vehicle then we will assume that you have accepted the vehicle in the condition set out in the rental agreement…” It is a shame that they cannot employ people who will professionally carry out their duties and ensure that cars are in a good condition and defects are accurately reported. The people in customer services are equally unhelpful; their attitude seems to be ‘tough, you agreed to the T&Cs’. The ineptitude of the people who check the cars and the ‘hard luck’ attitude of the customer services reflect the bad name that some car hire companies have."

Totally unnecessary (especially as every other rental car company was based in side the comfortable arrival terminal).\n\n2) As you waited for your ticket to come up as, you could see 50% of staff chatting to each other vs serving customers adding significant waiting time [which obviously would not have happened if people were allowed to be inside]\n\n2) Despite me saying clearly that I didn’t want excess insurance cover, I received a hard sell and was effectively threatened when I didn’t take and was asked for an additional €500 deposit.\n\n3) Having paid for a car for four suitcases, the car boot was not close to large enough to fit (and they were soft squeezable suitcases) and I was made to pay more for a larger car (€25 per day)\n\n4) On return, there were no spaces and I parked in the second row of Europcar spaces. I returned the key and was told “it was my job to move it” (by one of the four people standing around doing nothing)\n\n5) The car on filling up had a diesel cap but two stickers said unleaded petrol.

After being told I had to have it, later got charged for 2 different ones by Europcar that I didn’t agreed to. Stupidly didn’t read the terms on the contract I signed when I picked the car up at Europcar as I had the kids with me but also wasn’t looking out for it as I had already paid for everything up front. Wasn’t told to look at insurance details. Europcar then sent me an invoice that cost me an extra £144 at the end of the term and after disputing that with Europcar was told I had no case. I’d advise using another company, saying no to the add ons and checking everything on the contract."

Try Nottingham, same response, it's only a 1 litre, what do you expect? What l expect is a rental car that does not misfire. Is that too much to expect? Plus we have no cars available dispute a jammed car park. Avoid the MG at all costs. 21-day rental and it will remain parked until l return to Gatwick. Gatwick good, MG BAD."

After I handed the car back at an attended check in, I was right there for about 20 minutes because I had to wait for a lift and everything seemed fine. 2 weeks later they sent a bogus damage charge out of the blue. Cue a 3 month long back and forth with them where I was consistently ignored, both the content of my emails and europcar would deliberately wait 2 weeks at a time to respond, presumably in the hopes I’d just give up and pay. They reached a final decision while still having not responded to me pointing out breaches in their terms and conditions so I took it to the ombudsman who reached a decision in my favour in only 2 days - in my opinion, proving that they are *able* to respond and had been choosing not to respond to me. I also had an issue that other people have had where someone verbally confirmed something but this information then just vanished into the ether when I tried to bring them up on it - fortunately this was a phone call so was recorded by the company. I will personally not use this company again and would suggest to anyone who does that you take every possible measure to protect yourself and just assume that the company will take advantage anywhere you leave them a chance to. I’d like to be able to add something positive but honestly even from the start it wasn’t a positive experience. There were more small incidents that didn’t warrant a complaint from me, such as a (male) check in attendant who didn’t understand why I (female) wouldn’t give out my personal details on the phone when I was in public on a train; the fact that I’d booked for a Vauxhall corsa type car and they gave me an MG SUV type vehicle when I’ve never driven anything that big before and the same man told me I’d probably find it easier because it’s automatic… in my opinion, just not a customer led experience or company attitude unfortunately"

The trim came off a further 4 times and I could not drive about 55mph on the motorway and needing to make emergency stops.\n\nWhen I arrived I instantly called to complain and air my disgust with the poor service and poor quality vehicle they provided me with. They told me I'd need to drive 1 hour away to collect another vehicle which I refused and was told they didn't know when they would have a replacement as they had customers waiting from 4 days prior!\n\nI was passed from pillar to post, told to ring their AA cover who came and gaffa taped the car back together whilst still waiting for an update on a replacement car.\nAfter being advised I would be called first thing the following morning and 4 days later I've had no contact despite calling again and sending a complaint.\n\nI'm now expected to drive this car for the return journey of 270 miles with 2 children and a car that is taped together.\n\nNever again will I hire a car from Europcar."

I explained that I had insurance and he just kept repeating that I was not insured because I had a collision and it was my fault (without even asking about the circumstances of the collision).\n\nI refused to pay. This saga continued at the airport and the threat of calling the police was raised by Europcar which I welcomed but this was a bluff on the part of the agent at Europcar.\n\nPlease also be aware that after you have paid for insurance online, when you arrive at your destination they ask you for more money (160 euros in my case) and tell you that you are not covered for an accident unless you buy this additional product. Cynical as I was, I did pay the additional amount and then was still told after a collision that despite having two policies (one for excess cover and one for any type of damage) neither were valid.\n\nNobody has contacted me since so I can only assume that this was pressure applied at the time to frighten customers. I worry that many people must have paid in similar conditions for them to continue to do this.\n\nI you think this company is reputable given its size please consider this review before using them.\n\nI hope that you find somewhere else and wish you all well."

Then THE DAY BEFORE I was picking the car up, I got a call to say I couldn't pick the car up as I've failed a credit check??? That it was a new company policy to do a credit check. I haven't got bad credit, but I was advised to ask experian why I might be refused. Not much good the day before my dad's birthday. I didn't have time or extra cash to book another car...I missed my dad's birthday. Worst thing is I can't find anywhere to complain, they make it so difficult. Upsetting to be a loyal customer and get treated like this... and miss an important family occasion because of a stupid company policy."

They accepted my virtual card over the phone, charged it, and then refused to release the car at pickup because their rude, racist staff insisted on seeing a physical card—despite us showing proof through the app! Instead of resolving the issue, the arrogant representative yelled at us and then charged £40 for a “cancellation” that was entirely their fault, before trying to make us rebook at double the price. Avoid this scam of a company at all costs. They’re unprofessional, deceitful, and clearly don’t care about customers. Total nightmare. I wish I could give then negative star ratings."

We were given a brand new Jeep (what we ordered) but on going to the collection point we were overlooked, waited ages and given a badly dented Ford Puma. We showed the paperwork which had the new Jeep showing. This was taken off us and simply changed to the Puma. We said it was not the car and were rudely told to go back to the reception if not happy which would have been another 30 minutes at least. We complained during the hire, after the hire, chased and chased. We did a trustpilot review and Europcar seemed to take interest and asked us to send in details again (to the same original address) We heard nothing again until today( well over a week later) from the Italian branch stating that the Jeep was the same category as the Puma. There was no recognition of the rudeness of the staff on collection in Italy and no understanding that we were allocated a new Jeep and ended up with a damaged Puma - not acceptable."

Three and a half hours later I contacted the company to be told it’s between 9 am and 5 pm. To say they are having a laugh is an understatement - who has all day to wait about for a company to pick up a vehicle If they had no intention of picking up the vehicle don’t inform customers you are on the way to get the car.\nI would have given the company no stars but there isn’t an option. The Glasgow branch seem to have a problem contacting customers and giving updates on what is happening and wasting people’ valuable time. Obviously customers don’t matter."

I arrived in Belfast airport early morning to pick up a rental car I had paid for in advance. The lady behind the desk was lovely with good chat. I was offered a complementary upgrade - I thought wow this was nice, this proved a fallacy as a couple of days after I had returned the keys, I was charged on my credit card out of the deposit. Having looked after the car and taken photos of the condition when I handed it in, I assumed I had been charged for some perceived scratch and was about to argue. When I enquired I found out the charge was for the upgrade which I had assumed was complementary/free.\n\nThe way I was charged was misleading and deceptive since I was not charged on the day I picked up the vehicle and accepted the 'complementary upgrade' and therefore did not receive a paper receipt from the sales point terminal. I signed what I thought was a contract for renting of the car, I had no idea there were extra charges for the upgrade, the charge was in font 6 and not easy to interpret especially arriving early morning bleary eyed.\n\nI took the smallest/budget car as this was what I could afford and would have not taken the upgrade if it was clear to me I was going to be charged!\n\nBeware the talkative nice assistant and if they offer a complementary upgrade, triple check they are not charging you!"

When I returned the car ,he told me everything was absolutely fine and said I'd be returned the 700E in a few hours . They did return the 700E but then deducted 78E and I contacted him to ask what this was for . He ignored my messages for days .

Two and a half hour wait in 40 degree heat on pick-up, with no water, in their stiflingly hot garage in central Lisbon, which ruined the first day of our holiday as we then missed our connection in the Algarve. Incompetence was literally evidenced by the queue of disgruntled customers stretching back down the street. This is obviously something that happens a lot at Europcar as none of the staff seemed even remotely bothered and just had a look of total disinterest whenever anyone complained. Due to their own total incompetence they then failed to fill the car with petrol and were in such a rush they failed to check the car in any way before we departed. So you'll never guess what happened next, oh yes, they send us a bill for more petrol and for a scratch on the car that they had failed to mark up on their pre-booking sheet.

We've rented many cars from other Bristol airport rental companies and never had a problem. We will never use Europcar again."

The other party involved was arrested at the scene, and we have clear photographic evidence and witness statements of the incident. Despite this, Europcar have requested over £1600 in damages be paid by us. We were told by Europcar that if we had paid upfront, we would have received the money back once it had been settled through insurance. It is quite clear that they have no intention of settling this through insurance, as this would have been a straightforward claim and taken weeks to settle, and has now been ongoing for 10 months.\n\nNeither Europcar or their legal representation have respond to our emails. In April, we managed to get a hold of the acting solicitors by phone, where their employee acted surprised and compassionate about what we had to tell her and asked us to send a full account of all evidence, comms with Europcar and witness statements. She assured us that she would be putting the account on hold whilst they investigated further and she would ensure we received responses to our emails (which we never did). It is now 4 months since then, and we have had no update on the outcome of their investigations or notice that the claim had been re-opened. They have now sent draft court letters out of the blue stating ‘multiple requests for payment’ - this seems unfair considering we were told everything was on pause.\n\nAvoid this company at all costs. They are complete scammers and show no care or compassion towards their customers."

Families with children waiting around. Taking about 15 minutes to process each customer and most of us are pre booked and paid.\nUpdate: it took NINETY MINUTES to get through and be given my car. When I arrived at the desk, there were two people serving and only about 6 or 7 customers in front of me. There are huge fancy advertising screens, and a tiny little kiosk hidden at the side where you need to enter your details. The big screens just want you to buy things, they don't tell you that you have to check in on the kiosk. This is not obvious, as I had to direct other customers towards it.\nConsidering that I'd pre paid, it's very far from ideal.\nOnce I got served, Shah who served me was helpful. However, what sort of a set up means that you wait so long when it's not even busy, when all you want to do is get a car after a long time traveling?"

We were passed between the AA, tyre repairs and general customer service instead of being passed to the depot directly despite using the contact number on our reservation paperwork.

We were then told that the car had no scratches or dents on it. However, on inspection in the daylight the next day there were four significant scratches and marks on the car which I then had to phone to report, why had this not been picked up already?

There was no problems online booking the car, I am a memeber of Europecar and a previous customer and had only rented a car from a different branch around 5/6 weeks prior. We arrived really excited to celebrate or wedding anniversary and looking forward to explore the city. But things didn't go as planned. I went to collect the car and I was refused. I was told that I didn't meet the rental criteria, as they perform credit checks. Even though I am a returning customer I was not aware of this, when I had previously hired from a different branch there was a slight issue but this was to do with blue light card discount, no mention of credit checks at all. And even when I made the books online there was no mention of credit checks. After being refused rental, which I fully understand if that's the company policy and anyone don't meet the requirements then a car would be refused. The staff were limited in branch as to what they could do I understand this also but there was not alot of help given, and knowing I had three children with me. All I was given was a piece of paper with a basic explanation and an email address to contact to find out why. Which I did and I also asked a few questions non of which got answered, one of the questions I asked was to confirm what I had been told in branch that I WOULD NOT be charged anything for this rental, they didn't answer that, all I got in the form of a reply was a breif description about credit checks, non of which are done at the time of booking, and exactly the same letter I received from the branch the day of rental. I asked about being charged for the vehicle ij branch and I was told that the car hire would be cancelled their end and I WOULD NOT be charged anything. I have this morning noticed that I have been charged £102 by the brach still, for a vehicle I could not rent, which is absolutely disgraceful. Be very careful when hiring, you will have to undergo a credit check, which is not done at the time of booking online it's only done in branch, if anything comes up you will not be able to hire and you will be left in a difficult situation and you will also get charged for a vehicle you didn't have. The original price for the car hire was more the £102, it was around £154, but we have still been charged £102. I then on the day had to go around to different rental company's to find a vehicle, which luckily enough I managed to find one with no issues in renting at all, albeit it cost more money but we were in need of a vehicle."

At the same time the system still sends you instructions to confirm your identity although you aren't getting a car.\n\nThe phone number for the branch, takes you to the main customer service, and again they do not know the availability of vehicles at the branch.\n\nThe company is extremely difficult to book with and contact, therefore I would avoid at all costs if you don't want to waste your time."

I am writing regarding my recent car rental experience in Barcelona, under reservation number 1177604295, from 5th July to 12th July. Firstly, I would like to express my satisfaction with the overall rental experience. The car and service provided were excellent, contributing to an enjoyable trip. However, I have noticed a discrepancy in the final charges that I would like to address. Upon reviewing my final bill, I discovered a charge of 108.51 euros labeled as a \"cross border fee.\" When initially asked by the Europcar representative if I planned to travel outside of Spain, I specifically stated that I would not be doing so. The charges were explained to me as airport fees, but after referring to your website, I have found that they are indeed intended for crossing the Spanish border. During my trip, I did not travel outside of Spain. When returning the car, I inquired about these charges and was informed by the counter representative that the car's GPS would be checked. If no cross-border travel was detected, the charges would be refunded. As these charges have not yet been refunded, I kindly request that you look into this matter and issue a refund for the cross border fee of 108.51 euros. Thank you for your attention"

      "text": "They are cheaters. At least the manager Evan from Europcar Glasgow Airport with whom I signed the rental agreement. When renting a car I never pay for full coverage because I have more than 20 year driving experience without any accidents. In July 2024 I rented a car for 10 days in Glasgow airport for 162 pounds (which was a good deal). When I signed the agreement the manager asked me whether I want to add full protection. I said ''no''. He said ''Ok, then we leave your booking as it is and I only need a couple of signatures from you´´. That's quite standard when you rent a car. I did not expect any cheating or fraud (I rented cars in Europcar many times before) and signed the agreement without careful reading. At the start of the rental period I was charged exactly the total I expected (and therefore I did not suspect anything) but after I returned the car I discovered that additional 314 pounds were charged from my card. I contacted customer service but they told me that additional money was charged for additional optional product according to the agreement that was signed. And they appear to be right because I really signed the agreement! Of course I should have been more careful, but I believe that's cheating when a manager adds an optional product worth twice the rental price saying that he leaves everything as it is. Please be more careful when you meet Evan from Europcar Glasgow Airport!"

Yesterday the bank contacted us as they said there was fraudulent activity. This lot tried to take £54 from our account. Now the car came with 7/8s of petrol and was returned with 5/8s of a tank of fuel so there was no way it would cost £54. We have had no invoice or notification for this. Trying to contact the Perth branch is a joke, trying to contact customer services is also a joke as they hang up when you ask your question. We've been told numerous times that someone will call us back but still nothing. Absolutely shocking customer service."

Live quite far from Heathrow so, returning it in between was not an option.\n\nAlso, the car's extremely loud alarm randomly went off after the ignition is switched off and car locked.\n\nOverall, a displeasing experience.\n\nNOT recommended."

I called the advertised 03713840235, which i understand charges 55p a minute for the privilege to call Europcar to spend money with them. After 5 minutes listening to a recorded announcement and realizing the call had now already cost me £2.70 and still not spoken to anyone I hung up and will never be using Europcar UK again.\nMy warning to anyone thinking of booking with Europcar it the company charges you 55p a minute to call them to make a rental booking then how much do you think it's going to cost you to call them to resolve any issue that may arise after you have returned the car. Every time you call their customer services is going to cost you lots of your money and they will have no urgency to resolve it.\nMy booking today went to a rental company that provides a customer services number that is a normal national telephone number"

I told him I can't as I am going to the funeral within 2 hours and that I am more than happy to extend the hire. he was adamant that I return the car - again I reminded him that I an going to my mothers funeral in the next hour or so. He absolutely refused to let me have the car longer and insisted I return it, stating that I wouldn't be insured to drive it and he will send a flatbed truck to collect it.\nAll this rather than extend the hire.\nEuropcar wouldn't extend the hire so I can go to my mothers funeral. I would not touch these Ba----s with a bargepole.\nIn fairness to the guys that work at their place in Luton airport they were nice, helpful guys but the man on the phone seemed to be from some head office somewhere.\nLuckily the drop off place at Luton has other car rental firms there and the guys at Avis sorted me out a car. I have been hiring ever since from them and they are great.\nEuropcar shot themselves in the foot because I am hiring for 6 months due to issues with a collision with my own car and I have spent £4000 on hire cars so far but like I said - wouldn't touch these heartless ba----ds with a bargepole.\nI got to my mothers funeral as my cousin was reading the eulogy.

They won't give you the time to read what you sign because they have to go on their lunch break.\nFinally, and that's the best part, they will make you take pictures of the car saying that they've notified the existing damage on your car BUT will make you pay for it after you've dropped the car back on your own because they close at 6pm and have no agent to check the car with you later than 6.

He then asked if we wanted Roadside Assistance cover and said it was \"only £5\". Both my husband and I commented and questioned the amount, but he confirmed that yes it was just £5 so we agreed. Stupidly I signed the agreement without checking it, assuming it was just for the car hire (which I had pre-paid) and the extra £5. It wasn't until I got the final invoice after returning the car that I saw that the roadside assistance was not £5, but was in fact £5.81 PER DAY plus VAT, making a total of £48.97. This was an added cost of 32%. I raised the matter with Europcar, but they were not interested in what the sales assistant told us, only what I had signed for. I consider this to be sharp practice, taking advantage of people who have had an early start, travelled a long distance and are anxious to get their car and go. This car hire was only for a week. Later in the year we will be hiring a car for a month, but it won't be with Europcar or any of their other companies, so for £48.97 they've lost out on a future hire of around £1300 and more on future hires."

The phone number was invalid, and no one answered the phone for days. When I called the UK head office for help, I was misinformed, which led me to cancel my reservation and rebook it. The operator made mistakes with the pickup location, and when I called immediately after receiving my confirmation email, I was told that I had to cancel and rebook instead of making amendments. To my surprise, the operator offered a 20% discount for the mistakes but then asked me to pay more than my previous reservation. When I questioned this, the operator requested my security number for a manual payment, but the transaction kept failing despite repeated attempts. The operator refused to let me speak with a manager or another staff member. I asked for a full refund and for all my information to be deleted. I later found that incorrect transactions had been approved by Europcar, and I suspected possible fraudulent activity. It was a terrible experience, causing unnecessary stress due to unprofessional and unacceptable behavior from the staff. This left me without a reservation and with concerns about fraud.

      "text": "The upgrade was suggested by the employee herself because the car we ordered had room for 3 large suitcases (and was therefor ordered by us) and the one she suggested did not have enough space. In other words, the proposed car did not match the car we explicitly ordered. So after dealing with the papers, she put the paper, which said you had to pay for this upgrade, between the papers to be signed. So we signed these papers blindly and in good faith as she said NOTHING about the extra cost of the upgrade.\n\nAt no point was it mentioned that this would have an additional cost. We would have settled this immediately if this was the case and IF we agreed upon an extra cost. The fact that you did not do this until July 26 on your own initiative shows that there was no transparency about this.\n\nWe also asked before signing the documents whether there were any additional costs and that was not the case (the lady confirmed this))!\nThe deposit on my credit card was released only after my phone on 23 July where I had already returned the car on 9 July. The upgrade was also only taken from my credit card at that time whereas normally it should have been done immediately.\nThis really smells like a scam where they make the customer think they don't have to pay more for their supposedly good service that you pay dearly for. Because I had not booked directly with them, a deposit of 1061 € was reserved on my credit card, which was only released after I had inquired. I called Customer Service 3 times, hung on the line for 15 minutes each time and then put the phone down without explanation. NEVER AGAIN EUROPCAR!\n\nWe find this way of working unprecedented and unacceptable and we demand a full refund of the deducted amount immediately.\n\nWe count on the professional handling of this complaint.\n\nAnd so then below you get the standard response europcar gives to everyone on a bad review. Outrageous ! They don't even bother to answer personally. This is probably just a robot giving this answer when a review comes with low ratings !!!"

I was conned into signing for a completely unnecessary and unwanted upgrade for £248 which doubled my initial booking cost!\n\nI was alone with two kids and plenty of bags after a tiring journey and the agent took full advantage by dismissing my concerns and questions and talking as fast as possible until it felt rude to keep asking him to slow down.\n\nWhen I tried to read what I was signing I felt stressed and rushed because I had two kids and all our bags to keep an eye on and had not understood at all that I was signing for an extra cost or a paid upgrade. I was under the impression that this car was what was available.\nThe car had a big dent in one side so when I went to collect it I reasoned this was also why I’d been allocated a very different car to the one I’d booked. Clearly I was wrong.\nYes I signed the forms. Yes I should have pushed harder for clarity. But I have never experienced anything like this with car hire previously and was not expecting someone to behave this immorally. Terrible terrible customer service."

Was told I had to pay an additional £114 before car could be released as my 3rd party booking site had not carried insurance forward. Was told this was a system fault and would definitely be refunded, and this was the only way to get the car, Following return of car with zero damage, Europcar now claiming additional insurance was “entirely voluntary” and will not be refunded."

When I returned, the agent had a torch and found TINY scratch’s and a scratch on the underside of the bumper. Charge estimate €700. None of these causes by me. They must charge this every time their cars are rented. A total and complete rip off. Will never use these cowboys again. Never had this problem with Avis.\nI will take this legal and ask for a total history of charges made for this vehicle for damage to show the fraud.\nAvoid at all costs!!\n\nUpdate. One week on. Emailed & online requests made to Europcar for history of charges on this vehicle and previous return reports. All my requests ignored. On further inspection of my return report, it notes I drove 821km - when actually I drove around 100km. Their report is wrong and would indicate there are missing return reports from their system that could have damage on. I have now written to VW Group (owner of Europcar) compliance department to highlight the potentially fraudulent activity in their subsidiary! Will update weekly......."

      "text": "We rented an MG HPEV yesterday. The check-in at the Milton Keynes depot was relatively smooth. So we drove off assuming all was well. Since it was the hottest day of the year so far, we specifically wanted AC. We followed the instructions and then realized that the AC was working but only blowing in the footwell. There was no cold air coming from the face (upper vents)--in fact no air at all. Given the heat, especially after the car has sat in the sun, it was uncomfortable to endure and possibly unhealthy, given the risk of heat-related issues. So we drove back to the depot, only to be told by Amanda that she already had two people with the SAME issue. They also wanted different vehicles because the AC in their cars (also MGs) was not working either. So Amanda said there were no other cars now available so they could not offer another. She also said there was no recompense since the AC is \"not guaranteed,\" and that we were lucky since at least there was cold air and the customer who did get a replacement car had no AC at all. From this customer's view, it seems churlish if not deceptive that a car hire company is happy to take £1000s and rent a car that is not 100% functional. Moreover, when we called to complain, customer service confirmed no recompense and suggested we take the car to the service department for them to \"take a look.\" At that point I decided to write this review, given that after they rented us a faulty vehicle, they expected US to be inconvenienced and take time from OUR vacation to resolve THEIR problem. Last year we rented an Audi from Sixt here in MK and it was flawless, with zero problems. We made mistake choosing Europcar and will not be using them again."

      "text": "After years of loyal patronage without any issues, I was unexpectedly charged for a tyre puncture that was not my fault. Regular maintenance checks should have prevented such occurrences. Additionally, an engine warning light was illuminated by the time I returned the vehicle. Despite promptly communicating with the company upon discovering the puncture and taking time out of my journey to have it repaired at a garage, I was charged £14 for the tyre repair and £40 for administrative fees. The customer service was unsatisfactory, as I received a charge instead of compensation for the inconvenience. It's important to note that the tyre deflation was not apparent within the first 24 hours of vehicle pickup, and it was only on the second day that I noticed and reported it. The vehicle's condition at pickup was substandard, posing a safety risk. For future renters, I recommend documenting the vehicle's condition through a video at the time of pickup. Be aware that if any issues arise after 24 hours that are not your fault, the company's response may be unsatisfactory and result in unwarranted charges. The fuel was also not full on pick up and they told me I would receive 10 credit. This obviously never happened..\n\nI've obviously emailed multiple times to complain so their reply to this review means nothing."

Eventually decided to drive the vehicle to the branch that delivered it only to find it’s not publicly accessible. Finally got to speak to a local branch after hours of useless communication . They have said a replacement will be delivered to my address in the morning, I have no faith that that will happen. I’ve had quite a few rental vehicles over the years for business reasons but never experienced anything like this. Terrible.\n\nI have just read the reply from EuropCar. I had no idea that their fault had incurred additional costs? They did not deliver a new vehicle within the required time frame, I went to collect it. This was on 25/06/24. It’s now 27/07/04 and the replacement vehicle has an engine warning light showing. The vehicle is stationary and will be reported to EuropCar tomorrow. Not sure what they’ll do, probably pass me to AA who will pass me back to Eurpocar, as is the cycle. I won’t be wasting another day , I’ll log the fault and you can decide what you want to do with the vehicle. I will be lodging a complaint through my company fleet team."

I can see simillar cases happened to others lately so I warn you.\nDetails:\nWe had 2 identical reservations. On the airport when taking the cars one of their workers tried to scam us on additional insurance for one reservation, but we didn't approve this cost and we were finally charged only with 100 GBP deposit per car as it supposed to be.\nAfter coming back to Poland the deposits disappeared from the card, but day after charges fro 100, 100 and 290 GBP have appeared. For one reservation there was no invoice sent to the e mail. It took over a week for the customer service to sent It even tough I have sent them my agreement as attachmenet. It occured there is additional insurance for one reservation we didn't ordered.\nI explained the situation from the airport, placed a complaint on that worker and demanded explenaition, but they haven't responded. Even though I have sent 3 reminder e mails regarding no response there was still silence.\n\nI decided to open new case on customer service and after couple od days thay finally replied that the costs are valid. They have attached their version of the rental agreement. It occured that in \"Personal data\" there was some number to Switzerland (I am polish) and some dummy e-mail adres written in different handwriting then mine amd which I dont have on my copy of the document. That's why I haven't received an invoice on time I was still in UK. What's more there was additional page of agreement with \"additional optional products\" I haven't received from the worker and don't recall signing it. The customerservicesuk...europcar.com worker ignors my questions and demands for explanation, often being silent for days, only to reply that the charges are valid, ignoring the rest of the correspondence.\n\nScammers! Don't trust this company."

However on their terms and conditions it says:\nAn International Driving Permit is required in addition to a National Driving Licence if the National Driving Licence you or any of the Additional Drivers hold is not clearly identifiable as a Driving Licence, e.g., it is in a non-Latin alphabet (e.g. Arabic, Chinese, Cyrillic, Japanese).\n\nSo i told the stuff i have another driver’s license i could use and show to her but she said they don’t accept it but it says otherwise on their terms and conditions mentioned above. I sent about what happened and asked for a refund cause i didn’t use their service and definitely caused me and my family a hassle but still not very helpful. So for those who want to book car rental on this company. I DON’t RECOMMEND THEM AT ALL. You’re wasting your money and the queue was very long. It took ages to be accommodated by one of their stuffs."

      "text": "Absolutely appalling service from Europcar. Will NEVER rent from them again. I was travelling to Italy as I am part of Andrea Bocelli's management team and he was performing a series of concerts featuring other big names in Tuscany - I needed a reliable car to navigate this very rural area. On arrival the initial car they tried to give me (which wasn't what I'd booked) had a busted wing mirror so I had to trek back from the car park to the terminal with two large suitcases to get a different car. Within 3 hours the car had a puncture to the front passenger tire. I'm stranded in the middle of a very rural area of Tuscany in the pitch black and there is no spare tire in the car, just a lovely empty space in the boot where it should be. Some kindly locals allowed me to leave the car on their land until the morning but it was an extremely dangerous situation to be in as a woman alone. The following morning I made various attempts to contact Europcar by phone and email, to little avail. Despite having taken out their premium coverage package no one seemed to care. I am still (7 days later) waiting for the callback they said would be 20 mins. My Italian colleague also made various attempts - apparently not even speaking the language gets you anywhere. At one point I was told a tow truck would come and take it (offering no replacement) but I needed to call him back with the full details of exactly where the car was located. On trying to call back I got a message saying the number was out of service. In the end I had to arrange for a local mechanic to tow it back to their garage and replace the tire. They said the tire d was already quite bald and Europcar should not have sent that car out as it was. It cost 300 euro to get it fixed which Europcar have seemingly no interest in reimbursing. When returning the car I told them the busted tire was in the boot, a member of staff inspected the car then told me my holding deposit would be taken because the puncture constituted damage to the car, despite the fact that tires are obviously subject to wear and tear, the mechanic had stated in his report it was unfit for purpose AND I HAD REPLACED IT AT MY OWN EXPENSE. Disgusting service.\n\nUpdated following Europcar’s below reply: I have already emailed customer service to no avail days ago. I have also been in the phone with customer service at 11.12am today who said this would all be logged and I would receive an email with next steps directly after the all. It’s over two hours later - no email. Seriously…"

The vehicle provided to us was clearly unsafe, as evidenced by a spontaneous tyre burst on the motorway. This incident put my family and me in serious danger, and instead of taking responsibility, Europcar blamed us for the burst tyre and charged us an outrageous £186. This is unacceptable. We should have been compensated for the peril we were placed in, not penalised. For anyone considering renting from Europcar, think twice. Your safety is at risk, and you could be unfairly blamed and charged for their negligence. Never again will I rent from Europcar. I wish I can give negative ratings."

      "text": "Post updated at end of this following the Europcar response below:\n\nAfter a 3 hour delay to our flight into London Stansted last night we were told our pre booked and pre paid for car class was no longer available. We were offered a smaller class car at the original cost or a larger premium car at extra cost which is a lesser service than I have received at other car rental companies, but not the cause of this low review. To justify our car not being available, the staff member presented a rule about booking only being held for 1 hour, which we cannot locate in the T&Cs from our booking agent or Europcar’s own. Note for anyone with a booking already, in reading some FAQ pages there is the recommendation to add flight number (which we had not as we had not trawled through all the FAQs). So recommend anyone reading this to make sure flight details are submitted. But surely this should be front and centre in booking process and also the T&Cs?\n\nHowever our experience continued to worsen as on leaving the yard we saw the type of car we booked being given to people after us in the queue by the same member of staff who had just served us. They had also had flight delays and had been told their booked car (again a larger one) was not available despite their being several others in the yard. They were also offered an upgrade to a premium car. Numerous other people in the queue (we were waiting 45mins) also seemed to have issues.\n\nSo it appears as though Europcar Stansted are giving people the run around claiming car are rebooked but are just chasing upgrade fees.\n\nThe smaller vehicle does not fit our family and luggage so we have to make further arrangements. It is a sour experience on arrival in the UK for a holiday.\n\nWe have contacted Europcar through their website and will update this post when a response is provided.\n\n- - - - - - - -\n\nAdditional comment following the Europcar response below. As per the paragraph above I have already contacted you which was using the same link as you have provided below. I look forward to your response quicker that the 7 days suggested in the automated website response we received."

      "text": "Everything related to my recent car hire with Europcar went fine, until a few weeks after the rental I realised I had been charged an extra 174 Euros, which when I spoke to Europcar were for 'Customer Extras' taken out at the rental office. The receipt for these charges never reached me because somehow an additional number had worked its way into my email address on their records. Customer service showed me the contract/invoice which I signed (where I was told to). However, the staff at the rental desk never told me that the car they were providing was an upgrade, nor did they ask me whether that is what I wanted - if they had I would have declined. I should have taken more time to double check what I was signing, assuming that the figures were a breakdown of the charges I had already paid several months previous, and as I don't speak fluent French I did not recognise the French terms for 'upgrade' next to what I was signing. I still maintain, though, that I was tricked, hoodwinked and hurried into signing for an upgrade that I was never offered and I never requested.\n\nI have been through several Customer Services agents both via email and via the telephone, and was most recently told there was no other way of escalating this to a manager or requesting my case be heard by anybody else. I think this practice is despicable, and I see I'm not the only one who has been stung in this way. Avoid Europcar at all costs, even if their deal *seems* the cheapest.\n\nI know Europcar will likely respond asking me to complete their online form to see if this can be resolved, but I have been to the end of this process already. Europcar, if you read these - please advise on how else I can seek a refund."

I prepaid £394.04, which included the Basic Protection Plan. Upon arrival, I was in a rush to pick up my family and trusted the Europcar employee, Danielle, who assured me that the only extra charge would be a refundable £510 deposit. I explicitly stated that I did not want any additional insurance.\n\nTo my surprise, when the invoice arrived, I was charged for:\n\nSuper Personal Accident Protection: £56\nSelection Protection Package: £210\nRoadside Assistance: £77.03\n\nThese charges were never discussed or agreed upon. The total amount on the invoice, including unexpected fees like a Premium Station Surcharge and various licenses, did not match the initial quote.\n\nThis isn't the first time I've encountered such issues with Europcar. Last year, a similar situation occurred, and despite raising a ticket, I received an unhelpful response, forcing me to accept the unjust charges.\n\nThis repeated experience of hidden costs and lack of transparency is unacceptable. I feel deceived and let down by Europcar’s practices. I urge potential customers to be extremely cautious and thoroughly review every detail before signing anything.\n\nOverall, my trust in Europcar has been severely undermined, and I won't be using their services again"

My engineer was sick so had to change the Name, eventhough you cant contact Keddy Car, Europcar claim no responsibility, so I have just had to spend another £200 on a new rental for today whilst losing the rental before...totalling £300....Overall I have lost\n£1300 to these con artists.

      "text": "As our flight was delayed, I called ahead to let Europcar know that we would be late to collect our vehicle. The man on the phone explained that, it is totally ok as as a courtesy, staff members stay at their desk for up to 2 hours after a booking is due. I asked if there was any fees involved. He said no, its free, flights are delayed all of the time, so we don't charge for it. Amazed and happy, we finally arrived at Dublin Airport only an hour after our booking.\n\nAs I approached the man on the Europcar desk, he asked us what did we want. I explained that we had a booking. He said that \"he wasn't expecting us\". I showed him my confirmation email with Europcar on my phone which he took. He said he was struggling to find us on the system. After a few minutes he said \"you're late, that will be a 40 euro late fee\". I explained the phone call I had had previously with a Europcar agent. He laughed at me and said \"I have been working here for 16 years and I am a supervisor and I have never heard of this\". I explained the phone call again in more detail, highlighting that the man on the phone said \"there would be no late fee charge\" more than once. The man on the desk asked \"who did we speak to?\", I explained that I didn't catch his name. He laughed again and said \"if you don't pay the late fee, you are not getting the car, it's that simple\". Hearing that I had no choice, I agreed to pay it.\n\nHe then asked to see my driving licence, which I handed to him. He asked how long I had been driving and I told him \"11 months\". He said that \"you need a minimum of two years\". I explained that when I was booking the car on the Europcar website, this was not stated. He said \"it did say that, you just obviously didn't read the terms and conditions\". I explained that I did read them and couldn't find that detail\". He then asked to see the email on my phone and put out his hand. So I handed him my phone with the email on the screen. He then took 15 minutes just reading through my emails, going on to the Europcar website and attempting to book a vehicle, trying to locate the terms and conditions where it stated the 'minimum two years rule'. I could only see what he was doing on my phone by stretching my head over the desk. He laughed to himself whilst he did this and he said that he could not fid it. During this, he didn't say a word to us. My mum explained that she's tired as our flight was delayed by 5 hours. He said \"so, I've been waiting here all night for you to arrive, how do you think I feel?\". He handed me back my phone and using his own phone, quickly got up some terms and conditions stating the two year minimum. He then said \"see there it is, you didn't read the terms and conditions\". I again explained that I did, I just didn't see it\". At this point, I said ok that's fine, we'll just get a taxi\". He then continued to talk at us for 6 minutes all whilst holding my license in his hand. I gestured for it back and he ignored me and continued to talk nonsense. It felt as if he was doing it on purpose, to keep us there longer. He again complained that he was waiting for us all night and now we're not even getting the car, because I didn't read the terms and conditions, that we wasted his time. I said \"I understand that we're not getting the car, will I still be charged?\". He laughed and said \"no, because you haven't got the car\". I said \"I know that, but what about the cancellation fee or late fee?\". He said there would be no charge as they don't have my credit card details\". I asked if I could please have this in writing, he said \"no, no that's not up to me, that's up to the company\".\n\nHe then said \"if you go upstairs, you can get an Uber taxi for cheaper\". He finally handed me back my driving license and as we were leaving he said his name was \"Peter\". (I am not sure if he was telling the truth or not). We went upstairs and there was nowhere to get a taxi from as it was 'departures' only, again, this felt like he did this on purpose. We eventually found the taxi rank on the same floor as the Europcar desk and left.\n\nThis is not a complaint that I couldn't hire the car, I accept the two year minimum. This is a complaint about the man on the desk, he was patronising and very rude! He also contradicted himself several times as first he \"was not expecting us\" and the next minute he \"had been waiting all night for us\". We will never be using Europcar again, absolutely appalling experience. Avoid!\n\nand to anyone wanting to rent a car in Dublin, you honestly don't need it, the trams and buses are so frequent! and a lot cheaper than renting a car."

The salesperson misled me into purchasing a roadside assistance policy, falsely claiming that it was mandatory because the vehicle did not come with a spare tire. Additionally, the salesperson assured me that the policy would be refunded if not used. This turned out to be completely untrue.\nUpon returning the car, I discovered that the roadside assistance policy was non-refundable, contrary to what I was told. This deceptive practice not only left me feeling cheated but also added unnecessary expenses to my trip.\nI expect transparency and honesty from a reputable car rental company like Europcar. This experience has significantly eroded my trust in the company, and I will think twice before renting from Europcar again. I strongly advise other customers to be cautious and double-check any information provided by the staff at this location."

We didn’t take photos of the mileage.\nI have read the other reviews on here and it seems they are a thieving bunch of crooks!\nABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING COMPANY!!"

However, I would strongly advise using a different rental company based on my experience.\n\nCurrently in the middle of a nightmare trying to get money back from the company. After unfortunately picking up a speeding ticket in France, I was contacted by the French driving authorities directly to pay the ticket (Europcar must have given them my details). So I paid the ticket as directed.\n\nHowever, Europcar decided that they would also charge me for the same ticket, despite clearly not actually paying it on behalf. After contacting the English customer service desk, I was told they can't help me and I needed to get in touch with the French team (you can imagine how difficult that has been). Two months later, I am still waiting to receive the money that the company has wrongly charged me."

I paid about 100 extra to get an suv type vehicle like seat ateca / tiguan etc. When I arrived to get the vehicles they let slip that they didn't have 2 cars as they thought it was a mistake (even thought they had taken full payment for both vehicle types and never tried to contact me) they said I had to instead take one karoq as ordered an a volkswagen passat estate but would not reduce the price in recognition of the second vehicle. Bad enough as this was we recognised we had no choice on that day other than waste our holiday. When we went to lift the vehicles the karoq wouldn't even start! Europcars solution.... Give us another passat estate that we didn't want and said that they couldn't give us a discount as according to their system they were the same type of vehicle! If anyone has any doubt Google passat estate and skoda karoq. While they tried to convince me they were very similar the customer standing behind me chipped in that he was leaving back his car and they had done the exact same to his party but had gaslighted them into believing that they were wrong.

As TUI holiday had my wife as lead passenger, Europcar refused to let me drive unless I paid €120 for me as an additional driver, despite my wife receiving no communication to request who the lead driver would be. I mean, there was an assumption that she could drive. To cap it off, they wouldn't accept my credit card and demanded a card in her name be used despite us having joint current current and credit cards. Really ridiculous 'computer says no' grifting from a supposedly large company.\n\nTo cap our experience off a small scuff on the alloy which we discussed with the Europcar assistant and told would be €140 has suddenly morphed into a withdrawal of £350 from our current account (as the Europcar desk refused to accept a credit card in my name). Complaints in as this is just opportunism by Europcar for a minor repair alloy scuff that will never happen on a Lancia Ypsillion. Not as if it's a Mercedes Benz.\n\nAll in all Europcar's customer experience has been nothing short of abysmal. So think carefully if with TUI and hiring a car on these sneak charges based on lead passenger rather than designated driver as there is zero communication prior to the holiday to request information on who is going to drive.\n\nI have complained to both Europcar and TUI on these sharp practices but won't recommend Europcar or TUI. The latter should send less messages asking how they're doing and more practical communication. The former clearly have no concept about practical and reasonable agile customer service."

Europcar was quite happy to take £3000 for a 6 week hire and shortly after booking the car I received an email from Europcar asking me to complete a soft credit check which I failed. Instead of cancelling my booking immediately and issuing me a refund the Europcar online Chat rep instructed me to present myself for the hire and \"not to worry\" as I had a clean license and history with Europcar. I presented myself to the Manchester Airport check-in desk (after travelling for 24 hours) and once again failed the soft check. I tried to explain to the manager the instructions I had been given online and it simply went in one ear and out the other. Europcar would have been quite happy to see me and my family stranded at Manchester Airport with no means of onward transport to our final destination. Luckily, Avis came to the rescue and I was able to book a vehicle; however, it did cost me an additional £1000. I contacted Europcar Customer Care (lol) only to receive the standard generic copy-and-paste reply."

The booking was confirmed via booking .com 2 days before arrival and the day I arrived I was refused a vehicle with no reasons why. They left me stranded at the airport having to borrow money from family to pay for taxi to st Ives which Is over 1 hr away from Newquay and Cost me £120 one way\n\nI made an effort to contact customer service but they don’t have any contact centre to deal with a refusal and that you can only email which I did. 2 days later I get a response giving generic reasons for refusal and that I have to contact the data centre. Since then I have used another car company with no issues. How can a car europ car take your money and not carry out these checks before arrival especially booking so far in advance.

Said they didn’t have my number or email - this was rubbish as they had both and could easily have contacted me. I had to ask for taxi to be called to take me back.

My wife hired a car from europcar and after a few days the car developed an electrical fault she reported the fault immediately and later that day someone from the dublin department came to inspect the vehicle. He then told my wife the car would have to be recovered by the AA later that day so the car was then taken away but no replacement vehicle was offered so she rang the dublin office only to be told they did not know how to deal with the problem!!!! But then after seeking advice from a colleague the europcar rep said a replacement car could be provided today at o'clock but considering that the original hire car was due to be returned at 1 o'clock this was out of the question so my wife was then told to attend the europcar desk at dublin airport and a refund \"MIGHT\" be given!!!! My wife now has to find transport to dublin airport which is a 2 hour drive from where she and her elderly mother are at the moment. There is no bus service or train station nearby so it looks like a huge taxi fare is going to be the only alternative. The service she received from europcar Dublin was to say the least disgraceful and uncaring. So if you want to run the risk of being left stranded with no help whatsoever offered, then by all means use europcar or alternatively use a more reputable car hire company. If I could have given them 0 stars I would have done so!!!!! Europcar Dublin you should be ashamed of yourself UPDATE after sending 3 emails with all the details they requested I have had no acknowledgement from them, but europcar be aware I will be seeking legal advice and will be pursuing this matter"

We hired car in London for 13 days and half way through the rental we received a flat tyre and unfortunately it was a Sunday and we were in the Lake District so not close to any major towns. Ok so flat tyres should not be a major problem but as hire cars no longer supply a spare to at least fix the problem short term we had to drive until we could get to a nearby town and make several phone calls only to be told that as it’s a Sunday all they can do is send a truck to collect the vehicle and us and take us to our hotel because they don’t have mobile service that can change the tyre on a Sunday and all the tyre shops are closed which therefore meant we were dropped at our hotel with a car that was not drive-able and told that we have to call back on Monday to start the whole process again. So after arriving at the hotel I tried contacting Europcar to at least get the process happening Sunday night so at least first thing we can get a new tyre for the car as we had places we needed to be Monday morning, once again after several phone calls I was told nope sorry nothing we can do to help you tonight call back after 8 am, are you kidding??, I now have to call again in the morning at 8 and who knows when we will get the car sorted. So again next morning after several phone calls and being told it would be days before a mobile person can get a tyre to us they arranged for us to be taken to a nearby tyre centre and have the tyre changed it was 11.30am before we had a driveable vehicle so 24 hours without a vehicle that we had paid for, 24 hours of stress and disruption to our trip, and then we get home to an email saying they are going to charge us for the replacement of the tyre and no compensation for the loss of vehicle for the 24 hours we paid for but not able to use…. Will never ever hire with Europcar and will be making sure everyone knows about how they treat their customers"

You hire a car in good faith, I drive it carefully and respectfully as I would my own car. Then you get €742 taken out of your deposit for a mark that you can barely see close up yet the representative after looking at their phone/tablet went from the front of the car straight to it. Then quite cleverly made sure I didn’t have a photo of it before saying he would have to submit a damage report. Shame I can't post a photo the mark virtually disappeared when I gave it a quick rub with a damp cloth. I know a bit about car repairs and this would take less than 30 seconds with the correct polishing compound s where have they got €742 from? They are just making it up – its criminal and a money making racket. The rep even told me all repairs are done at the end of the vehicle life before they sell it on so it hasn’t stopped it being hired out again, the fact that the car handbrake operation was very poor was not even noted when I mentioned it.\nIt is a total scam and I thought Europcar was one of the bigger better companies, obviously not!\nWe were given a 80,000km Yaris in dark metallic grey with a lot of marks on it, how are you supposed to record every little defect on a dull day in a car park when you want to get on with your holiday? I wrote down tried to report further damage and was just told by their rep to go and photograph it. Yet when you return the car you are told it has had 3 inspections before it is hired out again, so nothing could be missed, yet I found several defects much worse that the mark in question that were missed, so the car has not been thoroughly inspected prior to hire. I will be talking to my credit card company and making a formal complaint\nRef 2347856"

      "text": "On 24 June 2024, we arranged to collect a medium size van at 10am from your Dartford branch (which is a 1-hour journey from our location).\nUpon arrival to the branch at 9:30am, we were advised that the vehicle we had booked, and type specified was not available, and that we would need to wait until at least 11am for a vehicle of that size to be available. The branch could not confirm an actual time of the day the vehicle would be available - only that it would be a minimum 1.5 hour wait.\nWe advised that our schedule whilst using the vehicle does not allow such a delay, and that we should have been informed of this issue prior to arriving to collect the vehicle and travelling an hour to collect. The branch had been open since 8am that day.\nThe branch offered a smaller or larger vehicle as a replacement, but we advised them that we were specific in the size (height and width) of the vehicle that we had prebooked and prepaid a week in advance so this wouldn't be an option.\nAfter nearly an hour's wait in the branch due staff seemingly having the same issue with various customers at the same time, they insisted that we took a larger vehicle to get us back to our location and that they would send a replacement (correct size) vehicle to us at our location by end of the day. We agreed to take the larger vehicle based on this agreement as we needed transport (an hour away) back to our location at the very least - but the vehicle could not be used for its specific reason for rental which was meant to be starting directly from the branch at 10am that day.\nAfter wasting a day's vehicle rental/fuel, being delayed a day on our project due to not having the correct vehicle, and having to wait at our office all day for the vehicle to (allegedly) be replaced, we contacted the branch via telephone at 4:30pm to chase up when the vehicle would be changed over to the correct one (we had been waiting from 9:30am with no update). The member of staff stated that she did not know when this could be done, but it would be done by end of the day and somebody would contact me prior to the branch closing at 6pm and when on route to us.\nAt 5:50pm, there was still no contact from the branch, so we contacted them again, only to be on hold until 6pm and for the phone lines to then be cut off when the branch closed.\nWe then contacted customer service straight away, who were of no use to the situation and did not offer any reasonable solution to the branch and company not meeting their obligation. Customer service stated that they would send an email to the branch requesting that they call us urgently when re-open at 8am the next morning, and for a customer service supervisor to contact me shortly after our call.\nNo call from the branch was received the following morning, and nor was a call from a customer service supervisor that evening.\nAt this point we have now wasted a full day of our time, cost and vehicle rental being a 24-hour company.\nBetween 8am and 9am the following day (25 June 2024), we contacted the Dartford branch via telephone 4 times, only to be put on hold and cut off each time someone answered the call.\nWe then contacted customer services again, with the first operator stating that they could be of no assistance other than sending another email to the branch (which we can do ourselves) and suggested that we just travelled an hour to the branch directly to speak to them (which is an absurd request from a customer service agent!).\nWe were then transferred to a second operator who also advised sending an email would be their only assistance, but then attempted to contact the branch directly, and confirmed that they were also not successful in doing so various times. The second operator then confirmed that he had contacted a party from the branch indirectly and was promised that someone from the Dartford branch would contact me “within minutes”. As expected with the current level of customer service from Europcar at this point, this did not happen, and no contact has been made.\nWe have now wasted two days of time, cost, and vehicle rental, with our project now being two days behind due to the branch or Europcar not fulfilling their obligation or supplying any sort of customer service.\nAt present, we have a vehicle sitting outside our office that cannot be used for the purpose we paid for, with zero customer service from the branch or call center."

This effort on my part didn't allow me time to refill the petrol tank to full. *it was half full when the exchange took place.

Considering the 50Litre capacity tank was half full I couldn't understand how they could fit 36 litres more in,and charge me an extortionate rate as reward for me helping them out. Car stank from first day I had it, no proper valeting carried out on that site in Portadown clearly. The replacement car also stank and they billed me for another £30 worth of petrol despite me returning it full! They are running a complete scam on that site.\n\n**Update because Europcar has commented on this review** I put these points to Europcar before leaving this review hoping they would correct the charges made.

Received confirmation of 0 damages etc etc. Now I've been told that my deposit will not be refunded.\n\nReason - when I extended the rental, payment was not taken ( which it was). I then had to send bank statements to prove that the payment was indeed taken. Over a month has passed still nothing from Europcar.\n\nI've been using Europcar for many years and have never had an issue. I can only assume that the economic crisis is impacting them more than we think, and they're now trying to find ways to recoup any loss of earnings during the pandemic.\n\nIt appears that alot of people have experienced similar issues. And my credit card company has confirmed this.\n\nThankfully, I paid the deposit with my credit card.\n\nBe aware, and if you do decide to use them pay using your credit card so you are protected."

Received an instant confirmation number but didn’t noticed the disclaimer that it could take up to 8 hours to confirm my booking even though it was booked to collect two hours later. Arrived at the office to find it closed for the day. Contacted customer service who then said that they would not be accepting my booking as they were closed Sundays. In this age of technology a computised system should not be able to book something that is not possible to deliver. In addition payments taken cannot be returned to me for 3-10 days. In this age of technology this really is not good enough."

Got a lift to Northampton office and told my car has been given to someone else and booking changed to Monday because “obviously we have a waiting list” Asked why I had been waiting all morning for my car and why they do not answer the phone. Met with a blank expression from the 2 staff. Told I would get the car on Monday. Told them that was useless to me and they can’t operated like this. Informed them to cancel booking.

      "text": "I rented a car from Europcar at Gatwick south terminal for a week from 5th June and when I dropped it back I was told by the man checking it in all was in order. No damage was seen as none existed and it was refuelled. I proceeded to the airport with my elderly mum. Today a week later I received a letter by email from Europcar from their insurance department telling me that there was left side left mirror cap/housing scratch >5-15 cm and that I am liable for an excess. I have a speech impediment so I had my husband ring them to discuss because of my poor speech I didn’t pass their data checks and needless to say they can’t discuss with him. GDPR\nThey told me to send an email because my speech is poor. I feel I have been targeted here as a soft touch. There was no damage and this is all a lie. I can do without this stress.\nI advise you don’t ever consider a rental from this company. It was my first and last rental. This is a scam I am faced with. I sent an email and I await a reply.\nThis rental company isn’t worth the hassle and will cost me a lot if they succeed in telling me I damaged a car which I didn’t.\n\nPs following the reply below I have emailed many times and all I am told by three different replies there is there was damage on the car on return and I have been sent a ‘statement of return’ dated correctly but with a forgery signature on it. It states I ageee to damage on a side mirror. Doesn’t this really make you so annoyed. Where is the justice here. I have asked repeatedly for the name of the staff member but that person remains anonymous. They are hiding behind a company with a large customer services department but they are BAD. A photo attached but because this was not pointed out at the time of return I have no way to confirm this was or was not present. This is evil. I am 56 and I have been renting cars for 36 years and never have I had an experience as this. It’s pure fraud and this needs to be called out for what it is and Europcar need to look into this and their employees involved here. There are two who accepted back the car and one of those is the man at the rental desk the day I hired the car.\nWho needs this hassel. Now a bill by email today for €274. Believe me they have picked the wrong person to annoy and I will not be parting with any of my money to settle this fraudulent bill. I am an honest person and if there was damage on the car and it was pointed out to me on return then I would be the first to pay up. In fact I have an insurance for the excess but this is wrong on all accounts and I will not be settling. How dare they treat their customers like this. Shame on them and shame on all Europcar for allowing this to happen despite my emails.\nIf I lived near Gatwick airport I would go to the europcar office there and find the members of staff involved. I would insist on looking at the damage on the car to measure if this scratch exists and if it is over 5cm even though this is now 5 weeks today after the car was returned.\nEuropcar you are awful"

On picking up the car from the airport in Santiago Spain .On top of the hire fee which I had already paid I was charged a deposit of e100 which I was told I would be refunded on returing the Keys and Car .This company requires the car returning with a full tank of fuel . So I filled up at the filling station across the road from where the car was dropped off and I filled it to the brim . Its now 3 months later and they have not refunded me the deposit and they also charged me £36 for fuel. I even had the member of their staff who checked in the returned car to sign my fuel receipt and confirm the car had been returned in the same condition i picked it up in and with a full tank . I have only had one reply from this company to say they would refund me and that was on the 28th of April. its now the 20th June and still nothing. There is clearly a problem within this company . Due to this dishonest bill for fuel and not refunding my deposit I will now make sure that everyone on the Spanish Santiago De Compostela pilgrim web page, many of whom need to rent a car to return to where they started their walk in Spain ,Are fully aware of the suspect way this company operates."

So they charged me £60 weeks later without notice for the PCN and another $40 for their admin fee. Revolut froze my card immediately before the money was deducted and I got in touch with Europcar customer service. While the correspondence was still ongoing, they sent me a letter from their legal team threatening me with legal consequences if I don't pay within 14 days. Meanwhile they take a week to answer each email.\n\nThey said this is normal practice and I should have the right to appeal. But both Initial Parking and POPLA confirmed that once a PCN is paid, the matter is closed. A quick Google search about this returned forum threads talking about this scam between Initial Parking and rental companies. Yet they are pretending they're not aware of this. So beware!\n\nNow they will reply to this review with a canned response (like they did on other sites) as if I haven't already been corresponding with their customer care for weeks. Forced to communicate with 3 different Europcar departments who clearly don't liaise between each other. It's like going round in circles and talking to a brick wall.\n\nEDIT: And there it is! The same canned reply on every negative review. They don't even bother to read the content. Don't worry, keep making fools of yourselves and proving dissatisfied customers right."

I returned the first vehicle in perfect condition with a full tank and never received my deposit back. I then got another because it was my only option at the time and I was told I would receive my deposit back within 10 working days. I was made to pay another deposit for the new rental agreement so at this stage europcar had stolen my £250 and since have been given another £250. I then noticed money had been attempted to be taken out my bank account to the tune of £559 for no reason. I’ve since had another payment try to be taken from my account of nearly £400. I have paid over £1500 total to rent vehicles for 8 weeks and europcar are still wanting to steal money from my account without any correspondence or reasoning. Scamming company that must be doing this to everyone that rents from them. I will also copy and paste this onto every review site available so all can see it’s not just them that europcar have scammed. It’s everyone that uses the company in full trust that they’ll be given a decent well maintained vehicle and a fair price and total cost for a rental. The car they gave me struggled getting to 30mph and would start rolling backwards when going up any sort of incline. What a horrible company to rent from I’d use enterprise if I was you they charge a bit more but then they don’t become scum bag theives when it comes to requesting your deposit back. They provide vehicles that are properly maintained and suitable to drive in all conditions too"

They did not indicate at the time that there would be any additional charges. However, this despicable company later charged us £285.6 for an upgrade fee and £149.92 for parking fees! These charges are extremely unreasonable! The staff did not clearly explain the charges and it is evident they took advantage of my elderly father, deceiving him and exploiting his trust in the company's employees. We ended up paying twice the expected amount! The charges are unclear and highly unreasonable. Despite multiple inquiries, I have been unable to obtain a receipt from the staff.

Take into mind that the car was only £106 for the week but now because we didn't have a credit card they wanted an extra 180 euros for insurance and 290 euros for the debit card details and deposit. The staff were very rude and our kids were getting very uncomfortable. The car was very scratched when we got it and so my husband took photos just in case. The site said that the car could fit in our suitcases which it could not but lucky enough having 3 small children we managed to squeeze the other suitcases on the foot well. We drove the car to the hotel. In the whole week we drove the car once for around 30 minutes. It was parked in the hotels car park. When we got back to the car depot one of the workers went straight out to the car and straight to the windscreen, apparently we had scratched the windscreen. I explained that we used it for a total of an hour in the whole week of having the vehicle and that there were scratches all over the car when we received it. The man sarcastically said maybe you upset someone at the hotel. Then he said maybe a cat scratched it. These accusations were absolutely ridiculous and he started getting very rude which was making my kids very distraught. I will not be using Europcar again, the whole experience has me thinking how many other customers they've fleeced and upset!"

Avoid this company at all costs, I urge you.\n\nMESSAGE TO EUROPCAR - don't just reply to this review by saying 'contact us through our website blah blah blah' as YOU NEVER REPLY TO THAT (even if it actually works and doesn't just crash!!). I have done that 3 times now and still no response from you. Actually contact me and put this right.\n\nComplaint - Despite them confirming I brought the car back full and with no damage they have charged me for something. Their website is a mess so you can't message them easily. No idea what they have charged me for as I can't get an invoice. They probably think that you will give up and just pay the charges. Its only 11GBP but if that is for petrol then its about 5L which would have driven about 50km. So highly unlikely to have been that the tank wasn't full!\nThis is the 2nd time they have done this. Don't use them! I ordered through rentalcars.com and they have not been much help either."

I told them I wanted neither as I was going to a funeral and had 3rd party zero excess insurance. When signing the contract I asked what the extra amount was and they said it was the hold on my card. I returned the car with no damage and a full tank of petrol. But today I get the invoice and they have charged me more than double what I prepaid. I now have to engage with their non-existent dispute process. I have been renting cars for 30 years and have never paid for 'extras' and am raging that Eurocar would try these underhand tactics.\n\nUpdate: Their customer services team have reverted saying ‘tough luck’ basically.

On the day we were an hour and a half into our journey and due to collect the van in about another 2 hours time when we received a phone call to say they were cancelling the booking as they did not have one available. Little apology, no effort to source a van elsewhere, just the suggestion that we had to understand if they didn’t have a van available then it’s not their fault. After a frustrating discussion we said it was not acceptable and they had 2 hours to source a van and to call us back with an update. We heard nothing back and after a stressful remainder of the journey arrived and were thankfully provided with a van that had just come back in the nick of time. It was electric but luckily we didn’t have to do too many miles so it was OK. Definitely not worth booking with a company that will call and cancel with little notice."

The staff told me my travel insurance would definitely not cover the excess. I then rang and checked with my travel insurance company, who confirmed the excess was indeed totally covered by my policy. In spite of my emphatic declining of their insurance, the staff deliberately left it on the contract which they hurried me to sign as they were busy and I had already taken up time. If there is any problem with the contract or the car, it is then intentionally very difficult to contact Europcar during the rental period. After the rental period, Europcar customer service had the attitude they were not present to hear on the day, so end of investigation. I would advise NOT renting from Europcar Oxford. Rent with a reputable company."

I made it clear I did not want to pay an uplift charge just for changing one thing on my booking. I wasn't planning on changing my booking but Mike at the Europcar on Northern Perimeter Road offered me an upgrade car which I turned down. My wife said she would like to be added as an additional driver and I was given the offer of full cover insurance or an automatic for the same cost as adding my wife at GBP 20 a day. I chose the automatic and added my wife as an additional driver. I was surprised to find that rather than GBP 24 a day, the an addition GBP 60 was added. Do not sign anything until you have checked the paperwork they give you. There is no mention of an uplift charge, 19%, just the item and the total. Zero mention is made at the desk that there will be an exorbitant charge just because you make a change at the desk. I wrote to customer service and all that was done was to point out there is an up lift charge that is in the documentation. I challenge anyone to find it, especially when getting off a flight and tired. It should be made clear by the desk staff that there will be an additional charge above and beyond the cost of item added, for the privilege of accepting the offer of the desk staff.\n\nThis is underhand. It should be made clear verbally and the uplift charge pointed out in the documentation. Most people like myself would not accept it.\n\nTo add my wife as an additional driver is valid, to disguise it by offering an automatic or additional insurance cover with no extra cost as I was adding my wife and then charging an uplift charge for changing to an automatic is deceptive.\n\nI wrote to customer service and I received a brief response that essentially said read the paperwork and the 19% uplift charge would not be removed.\n\nI have been a Europcar customer for nearly 30 years. This is the last time I will book with Europcar.\n\nAnother word of warning. There is no paperwork to sign and note any damages or marks when picking up the car. I took photographs before driving off and asked for the paperwork at the gate before leaving. The response I got was unclear so I drove back into the Europcar premises and asked at reception. They said upload the photographs. I could not find anywhere to upload the photographs. Beware, after logging on to the website there is a paragraph that says the noted damages are printed on the documentation you receive. It is not obvious. Take time to take photographs and compare to the documentation you are given. In my case not all damages, scratches were noted and the description leaves the extent open to dispute. Ask the reception to come out to the car, note all the damages and scratches and ask for the paperwork to be updated and sign the new documentation.\n\nDo not take anything at face value. Europcar will hide behind not telling you of the uplift costs and leave it open for dispute on any previous damages before picking up the car.\n\nVery disappointed by the business practices. Be very careful and ask for a full breakdown of any cost above and beyond what you think you have agreed to, it is not clear."

If you give up and nurse the car to your destination - a safer choice in my case, then expect to spend hours on the phone arranging a replacement car. It was NOT an option for me to go with recovery vehicle to Chester and pick up another car and they were less than helpful. All precious hours i need to spend with my elderly and frail mother. At one point I was on hold for over an hour! I was told I should have paid for Roadside Assistance and a replacement car would have been sent automatically when the car was recovered. Talk about adding insult to injury! YOUR CAR BREAKING DOWN SHOULD NOT BE THE CUSTOMERS PROBLEM. Quick efficient and kind customer service. I should also add that picking up the car at Manchester Airport took nearly and hour in a queue because there was only 1 then 2 and finally three staff. The other rental companies in the rentals centre dealt with their customers quickly and efficiently and they were no less busy. I have written a complaint. A reply from. Europcar to my complaint - not our problem talk to the third party you rented from.\nIt was a EuropCar vehicle that broke down not Rental cars.com... The lovely man who delivered a replacement car this afternoon said it was the 7th car this year he had recovered with the same fault the same VW model at around 40,000 miles on the milometre. A fault that could have been avoided with preventative care and good servicing. The fact that the car he delivered has no dust caps on the tyre valves (as did the car that broke down) because the people who check the car could be bothered to replace says it all. I rent a car every 3 months and I WILL NEVER USE EUROPCAR AGAIN!"

As the car was delivered with a full tank of petrol and I'd barely used half a tank, I had no reason to visit a petrol station before the day of collection.\nSo on the day, I went to my local petrol station,but try as I may, the filler cap flap would not open. I was there for ages, but to no avail.\nI reported the fault and when the car was collected the operative from Europcar, punched and punched the filler cap flap, until after 5 minutes it opened. He then informed me that I would be charged the premium rate for not having filled the car up with petrol.\nWhy? I had tried to fill up the car! Customer services at Europcar just kept quoting that it was their policy, and wouldn't budge.\nI'm so upset, as I really can't afford this."

      "text": "Very bad company. I booked to hire a van online and received a message to say that if the van wasn't available they would notify me. I booked to collect at 3pm at the Bedford premises. On the day I arrived the premises was closed so I was at a loss as to how I was going to get transportation and why they would allow me to collect for 3pm knowing they were closed?! In a panic I had to arrange transportation so called Europcar to help me. The man said he could offer a 7 seater! And that I would have to collect it from a location an hour away from where I lived. He said if I didn't make it by 7pm then I would lose the reservation but said nothing about being charged for failing to collect. I didn't make it in time and had to arrange a car last minute from a friend. This really caused problems for me that evening for my event. I am running a business and this costed me time and money. I then got charged £102 for not collecting the car despite the\ncompany messing me around like they did. I suppose they'll say you should have read their email but when you have been let down and are panicking to find alternative you are not going to spare a moment to read through all the T&C's before figuring out how you will find another van! While I've raised a complaint I honestly don't hold out any hope for getting my money back. One thing for sure is that this is an expensive lesson learn't and I will be boycotting this company for all the events I have in future."

      "text": "I was deceived by Europcar UK, and instead of paying £366, I ended up being charged £642! I never imagined being scammed like this in the UK.\n\nThe story is that I reserved a car for £366 with basic insurance. However, when I arrived at their office at Stansted Airport, they suggested I upgrade to premium insurance for just an additional £4 per day, which would total £28 for 7 days. I agreed and signed the contract. After paying the original amount plus 28 pounds, they also mentioned they needed to reserve £400 for own risk, which I accepted.\n\nUpon returning to the Netherlands, I received a bill for £642. When I checked, it turned out that the insurance was actually £28 per day, not £4. Although the bill I signed indeed stated £28 per day, I initially trusted their verbal claim and, being tired after my travel, did not double-check before signing.\n\nThis experience has been extremely frustrating. Please be cautious and carefully check everything if you choose to use Europcar. They were deceitful in my case, so ensure you verify all details before signing anything."

      "text": "On the morning of Saturday the 27th of April 2024, we arrived at Edinburgh Airport by 10 am as stated on the rental documentation to pick up a previously booked, paid and arranged hire car.\n\nWhen talking to the Europcar, agent, Carol she promptly informed us that the class of car we booked and paid for months earlier, a VW Tiguan SUV, was not available or for that matter no other class of car in that category.\n\nAs a consequence, we were offered an upgrade, at greater expense ($1500 Australian dollars) to a Mercedes, C 200, which supposedly would accommodate three adults and our luggage plainly this solution was inadequate.\nI, as the driver am over two meters tall (6ft 3inches) and with luggage having to be placed on the fold down seat directly behind me I could not move the seat back to a comfortable driving position and like my wife and daughter who took turns in sitting in the cramped back seat with luggage around them we had to regularly curtail our journey and stop frequently to purely to get out and stretch our legs.\n\nNo other options were offered and at no stage was the Europcar Reservation Guarantee policy mentioned by the agent which I have since found out in hindsight should have been enacted as we were according to the rental agreement documentation well within the stipulated time frame and therefore the agent and by default Europcar failed in their duty of care to me the client by not mentioning or enacting this clearly stated policy.\n\nI feel that an unscrupulous tactic was used to manipulate us into paying more money so we could continue with our trip of a lifetime. We were stuck and I had no other choice but to comply if we wished to continue our journey to meet on going travel arrangements and accommodations.\n\nAs a traveller you would expect a large corporation such as Europcar to act in the best interests of their clients and not place staff incentives and profit before this.\n\nTheir subsequent response after a supposed investigation was that the class of car was available on the day (which it clearly was not) and because I signed the upgrade paperwork there is nothing they can or are willing to do to compensate.\n\nEuropcar are yet explain to me why would I logically and conceivably reject the class of car that was booked the VW Tiguan if it was available, which was specifically designed to accommodate our luggage and driving needs as we travelled on the Ilse of Skye to Dunvegan Castle, for a more expensive car with a lower profile, which did not fit our needs, that is just ludicrous and I was insulted by the accusation.\n\nIt is my word against Europcar agents, and I was deeply offended by the insinuation that I have somehow fabricated this whole story. I have been lied to and coerced into a more expensive upgrade; they are the plain facts.\n\nI cannot believe in this day and age that a company like Europcar sanctions what is tantamount to basically organised theft.\n\nTo the Europcar Team don’t bother to try and placate matters by trotting out the usual link to your customer relations team to get in touch.\nAt last count, five different representatives of Europcar have come back with the same insipid response, because the paperwork was signed for the upgrade I have no recourse. Case #19808698 // #4482376\n\nLet this be a huge red flag to people who are doing their due diligence by reading this review on this company who hide behind paperwork, employ manipulative tactics to force an upgrade with their own Europcar Reservation Guarantee and Consumer rights being ignored.\n\nAvoid at all costs."

Europcar in the UK couldn’t complete the hire as we had arrived into the country by sailboat and didn’t have a departing flight.\nThe team were friendly but it didn’t seem like anything they could do as they said it was policy.\nHowever I’ve hired 2 cars in South Africa late last year through europcar with exactly the same documentation and no dramas. I also arrived there by sailboat.\nSo all very confusing. We were left high and dry and had to call back our friend to come and pick us up. Other companies at the airport were happy to hire us a car but it was up to double the price at such short notice.\nRequest europcar change their policy. Not everyone arrives by plane. People still sail boats around the world and usually need some transport when they get to their destination.\n\nAs you can see below. Europcar responded to this review by asking me to fill in a form with the details which I did. They then responded by email to say this was just company policy in the UK. Not sure why they couldn’t have just responded to this review with exactly that, but suspect there is an automated bot in play somewhere and they aren’t interested in genuine feedback on how they can improve.\n\nAbsolute waste of my time.

Despite having prepaid for our rental car, we were refused the vehicle at the counter due to a soft credit check that supposedly couldn't verify our address. This was clearly a fault in their system, as our address is valid and verifiable.\n\nWhat made the situation even worse was the complete lack of effort from both the in-person staff and the help center over the phone. No one tried to find a solution or assist us in any way. We received no apologies or acknowledgment of the inconvenience caused.\n\nOur weekend plans were completely ruined as it was impossible to proceed without a car, especially considering it was just before a bank holiday. We didn't have the chance to rent a car from another company at such short notice.\n\nWhile we were refunded the money we paid, this did not compensate for our ruined plans and the frustration we experienced.

They offered us a great price with a small note stating there may be a surcharge if we cross over into Southern Ireland, and to speak to the desk on collection. In all my previous years I'd never heard of this but presumed its as a result of Brexit etc. and didn't think it would be significant.\nAt the airport all was going well until they informed us the cross border charge was around 140 euro (40+euro more than the cost of hire!) regardless of how many days we planned to visit. I complained that this was a hidden charge as we now couldn't cancel and look elsewhere (less than 24 hours notice). Most other companies only charge a one off fee of 30-40 euro so why was this so excessive and not advertised on their site. I guess its to attract people with a lower price then sting them at the airport. The lady at reception was not helpful offering that 'it's what the computer says'. When I enquired if the charge is a result of Brexit she even had the cheek to repeatedly call me Racist, trying to divert our complaint! Not a trustworthy company and very underhand tactics. I would not use them again."

      "text": "Absolutely shocking company with no regard for the customer. Made one booking for a van a week in advance for the bank holiday weekend on the phone. Was told all confirmed and saw a pending transaction in my bank account (booking was made on a Sunday). Several days later I had still not received a confirmation email so called them up the day before I was to pick up the van - after struggling to find the booking they said it had been cancelled. However I had not received any notification about this (by phone, text or email). I therefore made another booking there and then for the following day, which I was told was confirmed, only to receive a very short voicemail from the branch a few hours later to say the type of van I'd booked was not available and no further explanation or offer of another type of van. This was late friday afternoon the day before i was due to pick it up. After being on hold while trying to contact the branch for about 10-15 mins the call was answered by one of the call centre staff for the whole company. I had to explain my situation again but was told there was nothing they could do, my weekend plans had effectively been ruined.\n\nFortunately I found a local van hire business with much better customer service (would definitely recommend looking for one of these before using Europcar). While making this final booking with the local company, which was extremely efficient, I was told that this kind of thing happens frequently as companies like Europcar will just take bookings, but as the prices increase towards the Bank Holiday weekend and other booking enquiries come in, they will cancel your booking which you made at the lower price while accepting the higher price agreed by the more recent booking. Not sure if that's true but it does make a lot of sense and my experience would certainly reflect that being the case!\n\nWhen describing what happened to a friend who happens to be a lawyer, I was told Europcar appears to have been in clear breach of contract. It certainly seems they feel they can get away with it because you're an individual not a big company with their own legal team who would sue them would it happen to them. My advice is steer well clear if wanting to hire a van."

They have today taken £29.23 from my card stating they had to put an extra 14 litres in. I put £57 in the car which was already on half a tank so they are saying it cost £86.23 to fill from a half full tank. I have proof of refueling and a picture of the petrol gage. I feel like when I spoke to them I was made out to be a liar and won't be recommending them to anyone. The customer service at the start in arranging the car however was good and the man who delivered it was a great help"

Was then told they had a Mercedes Cla amg line at an upgrade cost which needed a quick wash as it had just returned. Payed the extra for the upgrade and we had the car within 20 mins. They hadn't checked the car for damaged or give us a walk around the car! Went away for the weekend and once I returned they have accused me of damaging alloys and tyre and charged me for it. Have complained to the company and sent plenty of emails but they just don't care! Poor service after they have received money from you and get what ever they can from you. Will never use them again"

Attempt to go and collect the vehicle they then tell you there isn't a vehicle available! That being said had to get a taxi for almost £50 to go and collect an alternative car that wasn't fully charged. Major inconvenience. After I had returned the vehicle they've then tried taking money out of my account several times succeeding on 2 occasion bare in mind I had not authorised these transactions and had to go on a rollercoaster trying to recover my funds. I've now being emailed about an \"outstanding \" amount I supposedly owe ? And have been threatened with legal action yet I was the one majorly inconvenienced .I will never hire a vehicle there again and wouldn't wish that service on anyone . !"

      "text": "We used Europcar to hire a vehicle for the weekend in Italy from their Milan Bergamo Airport Branch. Booking the rental was easy enough, paid in advance for what I thought was a very fair price… When we arrived to collect the car, we were waiting a little while as the branch was clearly a bit understaffed and there were only two gentleman dealing with a high volume of customers, but when we got to the front of the queue we were told we’d had a complimentary upgrade from a Fiat 500 to a Peugeot 2008, which of course we were very pleased about! After reading that I would have to leave a deposit, I was asked to make a payment in Euro and thought no more of it, took the keys, was asked to sign a invoice in Italian and then given a copy. We used the car for four days, had absolutely no issues with it, returned the vehicle and had the invoice through to say the vehicle was returned in the same condition it was collected in and there would be no further charges. To my surprise, the day after we returned the vehicle, my credit card was charged with an additional fee of £178. I rang Europcar customer services, they told me I had ‘purchased’ a Premium Protection Package (which cost significantly more than the total amount I had paid for the booking) and when I told them I had not purchased any additional products and I’d like fee refunded they told me they would have to pass it on to their investigations team and someone would contact me within 48 hours! 5 days later, having chased them up again yesterday, I was fobbed off and told to send an email. I am now £178 down and there seems to be no urgency to help get this resolved. At best this is mis selling an insurance product, at worst it’s theft! Shocking service after what was initially a very good experience!"

When we did this (a massive hassle) then dropped the car off, the Europcar staff member who we spoke to laughed and said this was absolute nonsense.\n\nThe car is advertised as \"Ford Focus or similar\", but there was clearly zero chance we would have ever got an actual Focus or anything other than a ropey old Kia (we checked the carpark on collection and drop off, nothing but old Kias in the Europcar section, although SIXT had a lot of new looking Fords and Audis....). it would be ok if it was mostly Ford Focuses with a few Kias to cover when very busy, but clearly not the case so this is just false advertising.\n\nAlso, why is the extra insurance not offered online when people would have had time to review it in detail and see if it was worth the money? Instead of being pressured into it when in a rush to get the car and leave. everything else is offered online, why not this? Not only is it a dubious sales practise, it also extends the pickup time to painful levels.\n\nI used to use Europcar a lot for work about 10 years ago, back then it was a trustworthy, quick and reliable service, clearly it has gone way downhill and I won't be using it again."

We were thrown back and forth between Europcar, different third party departments and Mercedes. No one taking responsibly or telling us what to do. At the end the car was collected by Mercedes themselves but we had to get back to Edinburgh at our own cost. We didn’t hear anything from Europcar and they stopped answering the phone. Europcar didn’t cover the costs for me and my family getting back home. Seriously poor customer service. Now they refuse to respond and say that our case is closed since we didn’t contact them during the incident. Which is not true. We contacted them more than 20 times.

I was told I had been booked a prestige car in their finer vehicles range, as a courtesy car while my Mercedes was being fixed. I was also told I had a choice of vehicle in the category on the day. On the day when Kennington branch called me, I asked for an alternative vehicle due to specific requirements, which they said was fine as they would phone round to other branches to check availability. Then a woman from the branch phoned me and told me off like I was a child in primary school saying 'I hear you rejected the vehicle, that's all you are being offered, take it or leave it', really unprofessional. I explained this wasn't the case, that the vehicle offered was on hold, and told her what I had been told prior. In the end I had no choice but to accept the vehicle. Time slot booked for delivery of car was between 10am and 12pm, despite calling via customer services to speak with branch no one returned my call and vehicle was finally delivered at 4.45pm! I couldn't believe my eyes, having waited all day, the vehicle they brought me was a banger!! Looked like either had been involved in an accident prior or vandalised. Hence I rejected it! Shocking lack of Customer Service. The only pleasant experience for this drama was the gentleman who delivered the car, who was very apologetic and understood fully why I was rejecting the car, I was just sorry he had to drive this vehicle all the way from Kennington to SE London. If the branch had told me all we have is this scratched up vehicle, prior to delivery, I would have rejected at that point. Waste of delivery driver's time and mine! Will never use this company again and will let everyone I know not to use them. Take my warning, stay well clear and use Enterprise who actually take calls from their customers, return customers calls, give customers a choice of vehicle in the said category and go above and beyond expected customer service. I will also be raising awareness of this on social media!"

When I brought the car back it was checked in, no damage and full fuel. There’s a petrol station right at the entry to the returns that I’d used so it was brimming!\n\nThe next day I receive an invoice for £112 which incorporates a “Premium Protection Package” that I did not agree too, a “Premium Station Charge” which I was told nothing about, “Licences and Fees” charge which again I have no knowledge of what this is and lastly, a charge for used fuel even though I brought the car back with full fuel which was verified by the check in guy.\n\nWhat’s even more suspicious, they charged my credit card with an entirely different amount, which was even more!!! This makes a day small car hire £200 from Europcar!\n\nI contacted customer services to say they have made an error and to please refund the money. They say:\n“I can confirm that the charge has been applied in accordance with the Terms and Conditions and therefore a refund would not be due on this occasion.”\n\nThis is pure fraud and deception.

      "text": "Firstly, the amount that I had to pay when I got to the desk was TWICE what I was quoted on booking, as I \"had\" to have the basic insurance added - This should have been told to me at booking!\nThe car I was given was 4 years old and had 64000 miles on the clock. I had a warning light on throughout my two weeks and twice it told me to \"call immediately\" for help. I could not get through to the office, so just lived with it.\nWhen I returned the car, I was accused of scratching the door until I showed the original pictures I took when I picked it up! No apology.\n\nUpdate: 22/05\nA typical response that I was expecting back- it's all my fault and apparently I was lying about the warning sign as its 'fine now'. No apology for being accused of scratching the car. A very curt, accusing reply from Europcar. Not that they care, but I will not be using them again.\nOh and a warning - apparently 4 year old cars with 63,000 miles are what they are giving these days and that's completely acceptable to them!"

Absolutely shocking service and full of lies, we booked a rental van 8 months in advance from europcar Bedford for a trip to France, being told on arrival at 11am that our van wasn't ready please return in 40 mins only to our shock our van wasn't what we pre ordered, we was told our van would be a Renault traffic or transit custom it was nothing like it it was a huge Mercedes meaning that we'd have to pay more to put it on the euro tunnel because of it's size, we was then offered a smaller Mercedes that we was very happy with only to find out this van didn't have a spare wheel!! So we then took it back to Bedford to be told none of the vans carry spares but we could see other vans ready for other customers with spare wheels, as you can imagine we was travelling from Bedford to Remis (France) for 10 days and then back, we was not willing to take that risk, so then we was told there was a van in Northampton 40 mins drive from Bedford, but we had to drive then Mercedes van there and swap it for another van with a spare. We arrived in Northampton 40 minss later to be told then van with a spare wasn't available because it was just brought back with the engine management light on meaning it couldn't be rented out with a fault,by this time we was really loosing our cool, fortunately we was then told a brand new transit van with a spare was available... Happy days but to our shock there actually was NO spare.. absolutely disgusting fed so many lies, we was then offered a VW van with a spare but the side doors didn't open properly, by now we lost are cool and we had no choice but to risk taking the transit as we was leaving for France the next day. After talking to the manager at Bedford that we was not happy she promised us a 25 percent discount, 1 days free rental, and to wave any mileage if we went over it which we did and guess what we wasn't given any discount or the days free rental or wave then mileage we went over!! So we was supposed to pick a van up at 11am but didn't get home till gone 5pm, it took an almost full day to pick a van up from Bedford that's 8 miles up the road. The way we've been treated and the dam straight lies we was fed I will never ever use this europcar company again and I stress you to read this and consider another company as the way we've been treated with out any compensation is not on its totally disgusting!!!"

Once a finally reached the car the windscreen was filthy and as it was so late and dark I had to clean it before leaving as I couldn't see out properly. I then had to drive for 1.5 hours . This not an acceptable level of service at all. Why did this happen? This caused me and the people I was meeting considerable distress as they had no mobile signal and I was over 2 hours late.

      "text": "I recently picked up a car from Europcar Oxford. I had pre-reserved the car with a guaranteed price including VAT. Reservation no. 1171278816. The staff informed me very forcefully that no travel insurance covered the Europcar excess, so I should pay extra for Europcar's own excess insurance. This did not seem correct to me. So I immediately rang my travel insurance company and was assured the large excess that Europcar had was in fact fully covered by my travel insurance policy. So I very clearly declined the Europcar's insurance for the excess. The car I had reserved was not available, so I was told I was upgraded to a larger car at no charge. So I signed the form and took the car. However, when I later looked at the paperwork, I had been charged GBP 405 more than the guaranteed price. I have tried repeatedly to contact Europcar Oxford, but they will not answer their phone. I contacted Europcar customer services UK by email, they gave me a case no. 19781003, but said they could not help as the car was not yet returned. I then rang Europcar UK and spoke to Chris, who tried to help, but said he could not access what charges had been made. He thought perhaps I had been mistakenly charged for the Europcar excess insurance that I had clearly declined. He tried to ring the Oxford office, as he said only they would be able to sort out the overcharge, but they would not answer their phone. He emailed the Oxford office and asked them to contact me, but they have not. So I have been charged an additional GBP 405 and cannot find out why or have it adjusted. I find it appalling that a large company like Europcar cannot be contactable to sort out problems. It is perhaps a warning to others that guaranteed price is not honoured at Europcar UK and the company seems determined to avoid any contact with customers who have any problems. I have found it so frustrating trying to contact someone at Europcar who can help. I cannot recommend renting a car from Europcar Oxford."

Drove to a Europcar (Stirling) location to swap out (on their instructions) they didn't have a suitable car and said they would call me back the next day. No call, but Engine Management light stayed on for whole time.\n\nWhat is amazing is how I couldn't find one person in Europcar who was even remotely interested in helping. What a horrendous company, must be terrible to work for them. I will warn everyone against using them in the future, as I don't want anyone to go through what I went through after paying them an unfair amount of money for a little car that didn't work properly. Final kick in the nuts, is they wouldn't offer any compensation, but offered a 15% discount on my next hire car. But I would never use that discount, because I would never use Europcar again.

It was wonderfully cheap (5 days for 90GBP).\n\nAfter the (successful) rental period, some days later I realized that i was charged an extra 173GBP, which was a surprise.\n\nAfter some emails (booking.com responded fast, europcar usually with 4-5 days delay) i got the info, that i bought a premium insurance at the desk (at pick up), so they cannot help. The car had 2x insurances, according to their helpdesk: “with my verbal agreement and unable to comment further as I was not part of the verbal discussion”...\n\nWhat?!\n\nAt pick up, the agent (who was kind by the way) confirmed, that it is paid and it has full insurance, and i said \"yes, i know\", because i have chosen the option \"full insurance\" at booking.com. This was the full conversation about the insurance.\nHe didn't offer any other one.\nThere was no \"verbal agreement\". It was a trap.\nThe paper, which i signed there, my copy contained one line on the 1st page (with very small font) about a premium insurance, but it seemed to be the paid one (for me). In fact, this was a new insurance, which was twice as expensive than the whole rental!\n\nSo my advice: read very carefully the paper at pick up, because they have put an extra, unwanted item in my case.\n\nThe guy in the parking lot was kind, but the communication after the rental process was not cooperative. They repeated the same answer (copy+paste), not responding my questions, slowly, and didn’t help the find the agent (or give direct contact) who could confirm the situation. I tried to call them (desk at Glasgow airport, with no success, waiting during the \"please wait music\" for a long time). The europcar UK was a wall, which I bounced back.\n\nThis case could ruin all the whole holiday. I have to focus strongly on the positive side of the trip, otherwise this ruins it fully. :("

No worries, I'll top it up when we stop. Next morning I duly topped up the tyre only to find after another couple of hours the light illuminated again. I decided to put the spare on. When we returned the car I now find that I am being charged for the tyre even though it is listed in the existing damage section of the paperwork!! Do not use this company!!!"

Other desks seemed to be flying through their bookings. We overheard someone in the queue saying you can go to another desk so we did this as after 20 minutes no one had moved. At the actual car pick up desk there were 4 more staff but only 2 calling customers forward. Immediately the upselling started “did we want a BMW for an extra €50 a day” of course no we’d already paid what we could affordthis carried on with other makes and we kept asking for the car we had ordered. We were told they didn’t have any which was not true as we could see them. We were then told the extra insurance we had bought through the booking agency was not valid and we had to take out theirs for €210. I called the booking agency and they said this was not true and our insurance was valid and we didn’t need to get any more. Then we were told the car needed to go through the car wash and eventually 2.5 hours later we got a large Hyundai Kona (not a small compact car as ordered) we took it as could not bothered to argue any more. We today found out they charged us £75 for the tank of fuel which actually should be more like £55. Absolutely disgusting service, feel like scammers.

I expected a simple, straight forward hand over of a set of keys and motor away. However my agent sensed a mug. I mentioned I had purchased additional insurance via Ryanair so not to bother with the company insurance policy.\n\" Very sensible sir!\",he said. \"As a customer of a preferred carrier, I can offer you a heavily discounted rate on a premium car \" He then produced two sets of keys from a filing cabinet and asked me to choose one. Next a scribble of numbers on a note pad,crossing out of prices and next \" as you can see an excellent rate!\" Then the soft sell insurance. \" Of course the policy you have bought is fine except it can take upto 8 months to get your claim sorted and money back .You have to chase up payment...its taken off your credit card. It can be a lot of money.!\" So now I'm not just tired from my journey, but getting stressed and worried too. For my own piece of mind I took their extra insurance...a form handed over sign here,initial here and insert your credit card here. Before realising it,my costs had doubled. My Smooth Talking Agent no doubt on a bonus for additional sales. No mention of the car I ordered which was half the price. The MG car was nothing particularly special either. I was taken in and vowed NEVER AGAIN will I hire from Europcar. Consider more a customer needs,not commission bonus for quick sales.\nI called Europcar customer services shortly after my return to complain about the sales agent; I was informed it would be passed on to a manager and I would be contacted.....nothing happened,its now nearly 7 weeks,so hence my review ."

You can't basically reason with them and they wont listen.\nThey claim that despite the fact that I parked in their alloted space in the airport parking it's my responsibilty if any scratch is found on the car (for example another car may have caused it after you parked, it's still your problem).\n\nOut of desperation I try to contact the italian cuscare to try to resolve the issue, they just ignored me like the UK one.\nNow after 3 months I've got a bill pf 214£ for a rim scratch.\nLuckily I have my own rental insurance and I can use it, but word of warning for you, don't use this company if you fly in the night.\n\nA shame since the desk crew was nice and the car handled well.\n\nedit:\nthe company asked me to contact them after this review after I already stated I did it twice. Totally helpless."

They then sent me a cancellation email less than 48 hours prior to pickup. When i called to ask why, and why they couldn't provide me with an alternative vehicle i was passed around 3-4 people, none of whom could help or seemingly cared. My only option was to re-book a different vehicle! However the money i had already paid would not be refunded for up to 28 days, so i was expected to find another £1k+ ! To add insult to injury they then had the audacity to send me an invoice a few days later charging me a no-show fee. i've tried complaining, but what's the point? I have used Europcar before but never will again. I went to Enterprise and they were outstanding.\nEuropcar - don't bother sending me your generic. 'sorry to hear you were dissatisfied, please contact customer service blah blah' nobody cares."

When I went to collect the car I had to go and find it because they don't have parking at their office, when I got to the car I found both front tyres were covered in deep cuts into the tread, by the time I got back to the office they had closed for the afternoon, when I went back in the evening they didn't have any other cars so I had to wait until the next day, the replacement car was fine for a day, but on day 3 it wouldn't start, the Europcar office was closed, so I wasted the day getting their rescue service to come and repair the car (they went to the wrong town!) so wasted several hours, when I returned the keys the following morning they refused to refund any of the hire costs, after 5 months arguing with their unhelpful customer services I finally got less than one days hire refunded. Although I was tempted to take them to the small claims court I realised it wasn't really worth it for the amount involved. Reading other reviews this type of issue seems very common with Europcar and their customer service are completely unhelpful.\n\nResponse to Europcar reply: As previously stated I have already dealt with your customer services for 5 months - its a complete waste of time. If your offer to help was genuine, you could very easily trace my case and refund my money. This is your standard response which is meaningless. Don't be ridiculous - obviously you will not see me again, as a customer."

There was lots of damage on the car when I rented it and I failed to spot the damage I was subsequently accused of causing. The people at Europcar were appallingly arrogant and unfriendly. Europcar acted as judge and jury in the review of the case. I found in the reviews of Lyon lots of similar cases and it looks to me like these damage charges are a revenue-raising exercise for Europcar. I suggest avoiding using them at all costs. I will certainly never rent a car from them again."

I have never had that happen to me before. When I am asked at a car rental if I want additional insurance I always decline. I have never had the experience of it being put on my bill without being asked. Is that the Europcar policy? I have asked them to clarify that but they have not done so. It is very suspicious practice - although a quick google search shows it has happened to many others\n\nI was told that since it was my first time using Europcar I was being given a free upgrade so i assumed that represented the difference in my paperwork\nI was then given a form and told to sign where the x's were.\nI do feel that I have been tricked into paying a higher fee. It's not just a few euros, my bill has trippled.

I never managed to get anywhere with the support.\n\nEven the \"I've been in a crash\" option on their phone system cut me off multiple times. Anyone I did speak to told me to call the branch I hired from directly, but could not supply a direct number - just various numbers which all took me to the same switchboard. They said the branch does not pick up to internal calls. At one point an advisor laughed at me asking her to stop referring to a \"smell\" instead of toxic fumes.\n\n2 reps claimed to have emailed the branch and that I would receive a call back. I did not. Even when returning the vehicle the branch had no note of any issue.\n\nEventually, after spending the morning sitting outside the van with all doors/open to air it, I spoke to someone from the AA for support.\n\nI definitely would not hire from Europcar again. I dread to think how little support would be offered in other emergency situations. They seem like a company who do not care about their customers at all.\n\nEdit: I would add that I have already been in touch via email as suggested in the company’s response and they were not able to offer anything except a denial of any issue and a “gesture” of 10% off a future booking. Which I won’t be using."

Photos had been deliberately taken to avoid a big scratch on the side. I assume that's why they just drop the keys off rather than phone me up and tell me the car was outside my house. Car was absolutely filthy inside. It looks like it hadn't been cleaned for weeks. Whole thing felt like a scam so I haven't driven it or accepted it as a vehicle that is fit for purpose. I'm still waiting for them to collect the unused car.\n\nOver the course of a week I've had to phone Eurocar 26 times. And I still haven't had a car that is usable. The customer service is absolutely appalling. The only redeeming feature is that the internal complaints team actually do try and resolve things. Though they don't seem to stand a chance with this ridiculous company. I'm appalled by my experience."

Yes it’s your email sorry we have no reservation for you even though I’d spoke to head office minutes before who had the booking and I had the date of reservation on my email\n\nHead office said AA hadn’t booked me in for an automatic despite speaking to local office in March and they said it’s ok we will give you an automatic but apparently today Iv to go back to AA or I can’t have the automatic head office also said they don’t come that far (68 miles) I said well you accepted the booking and the nearest depot said they do and the garage said they do\n\nSo I ring local office they have no booking for me despite them having it last month and saying they will give me an automatic told me there was nothing they could do for me to go back to AA and get them to send the reservation I explained they already did in December and Iv had regular correspondence with you since that\n\nKeep away Iv never experienced anything like this with any other car hire firm 3 different people have now told me I must be mistaken and I must be booked with someone else and now Iv to do more running around\n\nI asked for their complaints Dept and he gave me a number then said it was the wrong one and gave me another one neither were the complaints Dept so can’t even complain\n\nAlso the first man I spoke to last month was the most argumentative rude person I have ever spoke to he was outright disrespectful and rude who needs that in their life?\n\nHave spoke to 3 different people in the last month and they can’t figure it out some can find the booking and some can’t just how does that work?\n\nUPDATE\n\nRang AA they also got the same email to say the booking was in for 16th April under the reservation number I had??????.\n\nAA put me through to Europcar yes they received the date and SAME booking number on 13th March but from there no one rang me for my details (driving licence number dvla code etc) to activate the booking no other correspondence since 15th March\n\nThey couldn’t tell me why when they got the authorisation from AA they just did nothing at all for four weeks and if I hadn’t of contacted them today I would have been stranded at the garage which is miles from my home\n\nPlease just don’t use this company\n\nHave to email now if I want to complain but after being on the phone for 90 mins trying to sort it I’m exhausted\n\nFURTHER UPDATE\n\nFirstly why would I ring customer services when I have done this numerous times and they didn’t help me?\n\nSecondly\n\nSo they finally give me the correct ref number I get the documents to tell me to collect the car where someone Will meet me to sign the paperwork\n\nall the paperwork says that I will be given a like for like vehicle. I drive a Toyoa Argo because I have serious mobility issues and I use walking aids.\n\nSo I go to collect the car at the arranged time of 11 am. The car has been left at the garage. There was no one there. It is a very large MG Toyota with a stop start engine which I have never used before\nSo I rang them when I got home to say that the vehicle is not fit for my purpose and I need a smaller car and that all the information said it would be a like for like vehicle, and they told me that they were trying to find me a smaller car and I explained that I can’t drive the car because I’m not familiar with that set up.\n\nI parked it up at 11:30 am on Tuesday. I haven’t been able to drive it since\n\nI’ve got medical conditions and medical appointments I am meant to go to.\n\nI explained that I had to go out every day but I haven’t driven the car for over 48 hours.\n\nWhat’s the point in having a car that you hire that you cannot drive?\n\nI rang yesterday and they said somebody would contact me. I rang again today at 1:45 and they said someone would contact me please just don’t use this hire company. I’ve been given a number again to make an official complaint so I will update this when I already know for a fact that nobody will listen to me and nobody will sort this mess out.\n\nNobody rang me before the vehicle was dropped off to ask me had I got needs\n\nI’m 62 And have arthritis in two places in my back and my knees and I’ve explained to them that I cannot get in or out of the vehicle and I’m here more than 48 hours later left like this.\n\nAfter being given a hire car they said they don’t normally ring people to ask them what their needs are and they often just drop the car off and leave it at the garage and that their vehicles are for business use not for prams or wheelchairs? So that’s why they don’t ring\n\nBefore I collected this car I rang the branch the day before to discuss my needs but ignored"

I was worried as I was travelling with a 92 year old relative in a wheelchair; it was getting dark, and she was becoming cold and tired. I rang customer services to be told “you will have to sort it out in the morning”. I eventually got a call from someone to say a member of staff was turning back. A rude obnoxious man turned up accusing us of being late. He also said he was in a hurry to get off to another job and wasn’t happy about having to turn back! - it doesn’t take a genius to work out what really happened there then! My partner was really upset that her elderly mum was getting so tired in the cold, and the man showed no empathy whatsoever! 2 really kind staff from the Enterprise Car portacabin could see we were stranded and invited us in to keep warm. Guess who I’ll be booking my car hire with next time! To cap it all, when I got the final invoice they had charged me a £60 out of hours fee!! I emailed them to dispute this and finally got a refund. Never again - customer care and service was absolutely dreadful!"

I drove it the short distance home not thinking any more of it. On Saturday morning, me and my family went to go out on a trip in the car and as soon as we opened the door where hit with a foul smell of wet dog, cigarettes and private hire taxi. We decided to use my wife's car instead and first thing Monday morning I called the Europcar team to report the issue and was told it would be dealt with when I returned the car the following morning. Upon returning the car, the sales representative sat in the car and agreed that the smell was beyond 'usual' and that it fell well below their standard. After many calls to chase, I have just received the most matter of fact response insinuating I am lying and declining any form of recompense. I find this shocking.

This seemed too good to be true, so I clarified this with the staff member. I informed him where I'd be travelling & he said option 2 was definitely best.\nYou can imagine my surprise when I was charged £50.40 (taken from my Credit Card) for using less than a 1/4 tank of petrol (which should have cost approx £13).\nWhen I queried this with Europcar they said I'd signed the documents to say I'd prepay for a full tank of fuel! Like most people, I assumed the documents, I signed, outlined what had been discussed. I believe this is a classic case of misleading customers for financial gain.

      "text": "Horrible experience with Europcar! Rented a vehicle, only to encounter a flat battery issue within 24 hours due to their negligence. Despite disputing their claims of 'driver error', they added unexpected charges and refused any refund for the lost day of our holiday and taxi fare. Not to talk about the absolutely awful customer service during the actual breakdown through to blaming us and adding extra charges! Not a single apology! only passing blame! Absolutely appalling customer service. Hiring cars which are NOT fit for purpose! Avoid at all costs!"

Why let me book something in the first place if you don't have the car???"

We had to come back 2 days later (paying for taxis both ways and being without a car for 2 days of our trip). Customer service was very unhelpful, despite multiple contacts to ask for clarity. They provided no information at all. I called the sales office and they confirmed because the rental was accepted someone had to be there to give us the car. We also pre paid for a child’s car seat and it wasn’t provided, instead person at the rental desk told us to go buy a car seat because it would be “cheaper”. It was not. It was a major 3 day disruption to our trip. Worst car rental experience I’ve had I won’t rent with Europcar again."

At 18:00 I called to tell them my flight would be delayed, the office was closed but the message assured customers not to worry the office waits for delayed flights. Arriving at the Gatwick office (an international airport) at 12:00 midnight, the office closed. Shocking service at an international airport where flights are still landing. I travel a lot and have never before experienced such poor service. Below this you will see a response from Europcar, it came to nothing, it's htere just to make it look like they care. AVOID them and any other compnay they own. I rent a lot of cars and this has to be the worst I have ever experienced."

I am currently being charged for £370 of pre existing damage because I didn’t report the damage within 24hrs. The check in clerk rushed us through and didn’t accompany us to or round the car as per policy. We just assumed they knew about the damage so had no reason to contact them within 24hrs. I did take photos of it though - just in case. We only got in touch once we became aware they were blaming us for the damage. We sent date and time stamped photos (including metadata so they could confirm they were legitimate) Their response - Yeah - we accept you didn’t do it - but - you signed the form so you’re paying.\n\nTo add insult to injury they’re also now claiming we had the car for an extra day. So an additional £70 charge.\n\nCurrently in discussion with a lawyer re fraud.\n\nDO NOT USE THIS COMPANY……!\n\nUpdate - please disregard token gestureistic reply from Europcar below -they have not responded or helped when I have previously contacted the address provided below. Every part of this company needs investigated by the police. below is a desperate attempt to appear to want to help in public with no intent to do so in private."

      "text": "I had pre-booked a Compact SUV and the location initially offered me a very dirty Compact SUV that smelt of smoke and had cigarette buds strewn around aside from being damaged externally. They refused to provide a different car claiming unavailability in the same category. They only offered a car, which was also filthy, from a lower category than the one pre-booked with no refund for the difference amount. By this stage, I had already spent 2 hrs over my original pick-up time. The least they could've offered is a higher category car with no extra cost for the sheer inconvenience caused to my family.\nHowever, the alternative offered was to pay extra for an upgrade at the site. It was clear that they wanted unsuspecting customers to pay higher amounts at the front desk to maximise the rental output from their fleet.\nAfter a 2.5-hour ordeal, I had to additionally pay nearly twice the amount of my initial pre-booked amount and cut short my rental period by 1 day to get out of there with a car to retain any sanity to enjoy the Bank holiday weekend.\n\nI will say that the car that I rented by the end was thankfully in good shape and had no issues on the road.\n\nUnfortunately, my overall experience on this occasion at this location was extremely disappointing and not the level of service quality I would have expected from Europcar.\n\nWhile I have been trying to get in touch with their customer support regarding this grievance as per the canned response from their business account, I now see a whole new duplicate charge for the rental and fuel charges for a fully electric vehicle (a new level!). It is simply appalling for now I will have to waste my time chasing them to accept their incompetence (that they will deny) and hope to get the money back."

Initially we were met with smiles and a super friendly staff, but were lured into buying more services than needed, and informed a price that excluded VAT and extra hidden fees! (which is illegal when dealing with consumers). In addition, this \"upgrade\" included a deal to return the car 30mins later than usual, in order to match our flight. No problem! Staff was also super friendly when we dropped the car off, and the statement of return marked everything as okay and the car returned within the agreed time.\n\nAll good then? No. We got the bill and we're charged for a full extra day. Had to fight with customer service for a week, with arbitrary and standardized automatic responses which didn't take the rental agreement into account, or even listen to our complaints. Have spent hours dealing with outsourced customer service, since it's apparently impossible to reach the branch directly. Now we finally got them to refund the additional day. \"A good faith gesture\" (not a joke, actual quote).\n\nBut wait, it's not done yet. Now we're informed that they will charge EVEN MORE MONEY. Another full amount, of the full additional charges. And for me to patiently wait for an eventual refund. Basically asking ME for a 10 day credit. What am I, your bank? This is insanely poor business practices, and without a doubt illegal under EU consumer protection laws. But I guess these are no longer valid in Scotland? So. That's on us, then.\n\nAt the end of the day we paid TWICE the rate that we initially booked the car for, and for the next 10 days QUADRUPLE cost. Absolute shame.\n\nAnd Susan at the Edinburgh branch, if you read this - please be a little more transparent with future clients, this simply isn't fair. I really hope you acted in good faith and that it's just the company screwing us over. This has been an immensely frustrating experience for us. Trust misplaced. Will never hire from Euopcar again."

When I arrived in Stansted Airport, the assistant informed me that no such car was available nor a similar as otherwise ordered and confirmed by Europecar. The assistand could however, offer us a MG SUV at a slight reduced price as the only alternative. With no option we had to accept this solution, but when we returned a Fiat 500 was in the carpark. With this information we turned to Europecar, who bluntly inform us that we have signed the rental agreement and that's the end of it. I see that the normal response from Europecar in to turn to the \"Europecar Team\" - this I have already done twice, first with the response that I have signed the agreement myself, I have then asked Europecar to reconsider, - no repsponse. Unfortunately, I did not read the reviews of others, but I hope my experience can help others who need to rent a car, to choose their provider. I am a frequent business traveller and have used more or less all rental car companies in Europe, but this experience I have never encountered before, please learn from my experience.\nPls note that all details have been provided to the Europecar Team"

Booked for 4 weeks as I am waiting delivery of my new car. Got to the Perth site to find the car was damaged! Because of the state of the car, I actually thought it was a staff car? Never would I have expected a 4 year old car in such a poor condition to be used by a well known company as this. I refused to take the car, wasn't offered any alternatives so was left in a bit of a predicament. I needed a car and could not get a car from any other company at such short notice.\nVery unprofessional!\nIf you are interested in the reason for refusal of car, contact me via the details under reservation no. 1173480373. I tried the link you sent but cannot upload pictures?"

      "text": "Flew in to Heathrow from Chicago with 4 adults, 4 large suitcases and 4 carry on/backpacks for a 10 day stay with several long journeys and had booked a ‘large SUV’ specifically explaining the space we needed! Europcar at Heathrow were true to form for car rental companies and did not have a big enough vehicle - using the usual lame excuse that they had already over booked for large vehicles. Firstly, I respectfully suggest that you don’t do that! Secondly, that’s surely your problem not your customer’s. It’s no fun having to drive several hundred miles during our stay with the boot jammed - parcel shelf having to rest on top because apparently we couldn’t leave it with them, and most of our carry on luggage around our feet in the front and back seats. Let’s hope we don’t have to stop suddenly - don’t want to be smacked in the head by the parcel shelf. Very poor service, which they have the sheer audacity to charge a hefty fee for."

She asked me to make a further 1 euro payment so she can complete the booking and I did. The 1 euro has now came back and it had been more than 3 days and the 300 euro is still outstanding on my card that I need to make important purchases such as food for my children and my money hasn’t come back.\n\nIt occurred on: 2024-03-23\n\nThis meant that My 300 euro is still outstanding from this booking and with the possibility it was not attached to my booking.\n\nI want my money released as soon as possible.

      "text": "Zero stars!\nIn December 2023 my parked car was hit by a bin lorry. Whilst it was in the garage being repaired their solicitors arranged for me to have a courtesy car through europcar. The first car they sent had warning lights flashing telling me not to drive the car. I called the company to tell them and when I finally got through to them I was met with a very unhelpful woman who simply told me to 'take it to a garage'. I'd had the car 45 minutes! I refused and they eventually (after 4 hours of being passed to different departments) agreed to replace it with another vehicle. The next day another car was delivered and the broken one picked up, I checked the car for existing damage (despite being discouraged to do this by the delivery man who stated 'its a new car, there are no marks on it') and found no significant damage. From the second day of having the car I was harassed every day by them calling me to ask how long my car would take to be fixed, I made numerous calls to the garage to ask but was informed by the garage that europcar should not be harassing me to find out this information and to pass the garages details to them so they could get updates directly, but they continued to call me daily. My car was in the garage being repaired from 11/1/24 - 26/1/24.\nI informed them when my car was fixed and being returned to me, europcar told me they would be picking the car up on the same day as they had allocated it to another client and would arrive before 6pm on 26/1/24. They never showed up or called (which I found odd seeing as id been harrassed everyday to have the car back) I even lost work waiting in for them. They called me on 29/1/24 to arrange pick up, I told them I would be at work but they could collect the keys from my mothers work place which is around the corner. The car was picked up at 13.15. The man picking it up said to my mum that he was in a rush as he needed to deliver the car to someone else and he was running late due to traffic. We heard no more.... until today, 25/3/24 (8 weeks later) when I received a very blunt direct email telling me that a scuff had been found on the bumper and they would be deducting £582.15 from my bank account to fix it - There was no evidence of damage sent with the email, nor was there any photos or videos to show this damage.\nI categorically know there was no damage at all when the car was picked up. The collection note I requested is partially hand written and has not been signed by me.\nI am now in the process of seeking legal advise.\nSeriously think twice about using this company!\n\nUPDATE 29/3/24 - They reply very quickly asking me to follow the link so they can assist in helping me with this problem but the link constantly has 'technical difficulties their end' so you can't actually follow the link. This company need to be shut down, it is openly conning people.\n\nUSE AT OWN RISK!!!"

After 4 weeks the break pads were non existsnt and worn so bad they were grinding on the discs. The second car had an issue with the passenger door. you could not open it from the inside! the 3rd car. the rear winscreen wipers did not work! so hire one at your peril.\nThey also top up the fuel when they get back to their depot and automatically charge your card without your consent even though I filled up the car before it was picked up apart from once when the car was not.dtivable due to the non existsnt breaks that were extremely dangerous. They would not take any responsibility for the faults on the cars. So I do not recommend you hiring a car especially from the DOVER branch of Eutopcar. They are quick to exchange the cars but they certainly do not do the full checks on the cars before they go out!!!"

      "text": "While the price of the car was great, everything that followed was not. I was not given the car on the day of collection due to not passing the address check... I should add there is absolutely NO reason that I should have failed this check. From that point on I was treated very poorly by the (so say most senior in charge that day) man at Europcar who just gave me an email address to contact and they would explain in more detail as to why I didn't pass the check... oh and they could take up to 5 days to reply!! Giving no consideration as to what I was supposed to do now (I had hired a car for 6 days to go to Wales and Bristol), he just said that as I booked through a third party website I had to contact them, the way he said this was very condescending and like it was my fault for not booking directly with Europcar. I eventually had no choice but to leave and try to find another way. So I do not recommend hiring from Europcar's Croydon branch and to be honest I'm put off from using any because of the way they do their checks, it clearly isn't practical; the very unhelpful man even said that since they changed to doing it this way loads of customers are having the same problem....! So it clearly doesn't work as it should! And I don't think I want to take that chance again, I'll just stick to hiring cars through the companies I have been using for YEARS and have no issues with, shame on me I guess for trying to find a cheaper deal due to the booking being fairly last minute, in the end I ended up spending more (I've not been able to get a refund!) than if I would have stuck to what I usually do. So to sum up I will be avoiding in the future."

Picking up a car,\nI went to the desk got told to go the other desk,\nqueued at desk after 10 mins got to your staff counter which\ntold me to check in via a stupid terminal next to the unit.\n(Why don't you put the terminal where people queue or a sign\nsaying to login - or whatever the terminal is for).\nSo I put in the details and queued again.\n15 mins later got to the front of the queue again and go told it wasn't\nmy turn and wait until called.\n(again why don't you tell us that we need to wait until called).\nSo after 30 mins I got to the desk and spent 15 - 30 minutes arguing with your staff\ntelling them why I didn't need your super/super insurance for £15 a day\nwhen my insurance document clearly stated not to accept your staffs hard sell insurance tactics.\nSo after being told I was stupid, which I replied you are and your trying to\nsteal my money, your staff get very upset and said they would not deal with me\nunless I calmed down. This was all in Spanish to again confused the situation.\n\nI expected to show all the documentation that I had printed off in advance\nand to have a friendly chat and pickup my car in 10 mins.\nBut it must of took nearly 2 hours to eventually drive the car away.\n\nSo after my lovely welcome I was told to pickup the car from the car park which\ntook ages to wait to be processed again probably another 30mins and\nwhen eventually got into the car I had to go back and show them\nbits that were not on the list of existing marks on the car.\n\nOn return your staff again didn't wasn't to speak any English and basically rude.\n\nSo in conclusion your Ibiza staff need training and when people say they already have\nsuper insurance don't try and sell super/super insurance."

Firstly, I was charged for premium protection that I explicitly declined, and then hit with a premium location fee that was never mentioned during booking. The icing on the cake? A known scratch on the alloy was somehow blamed on me in the report. Despite reaching out to customer service via email, I've received no resolution or even acknowledgment of my concerns. Avoid this place at all costs unless you enjoy being overcharged and unfairly blamed for damages."

However after about a week it was decided it was too expensive so Europcar took the Merc away and instead provided a Golf hatchback.\n\nThe Golf itself was fine however when it was provided to me it clearly stank of smoke underneath that awful stinkbomb they use to cover up smells. a day later the stinkbomb smell is gone but the smell of smoke is just as strong. The car itself had also not been properly cleaned. Clearly they rushed out the first available car to me with no care about cleaning the vehicle properly and dealing with the 2nd hand smoke that clings to the entire vehicle.\n\nWould not be comfortable driving children in a Europcar.\n\nNo follow up has been made to my complaint.\n\nI have attempted to follow the link provided but there is no option to speak to someone about this issue specifically or for customer service to get in touch with me. Furthermore when I do send in any communications it just says error try again."

We were then offered a higher spec car at what we both understood was Eu20 extra for the period. The assistant's English was good so there is no way both of us misunderstood. We agreed and naively signed the contract without adequately checking the small print which was actually Eu20 PER DAY, in effect doubling the cost of our rental. We only realised this when returning the car and checking the invoice.\n2. By the same assistant we were told this black car had a scratch on the wing mirror. Luckily I checked and found 6 other much larger marks. I went back to the office to explain but they refused to come and look, just said take pictures to show on return. We did this with difficulty as it was in a dark area of the car park. On our return, sure enough there was someone checking the bodywork in bright sunlight, who picked up some but not all of the marks. Predictably enough they then tried to charge us the excess. We showed the photos but this was apparently not part of their system and only by arguing really hard and refusing to sign (luckily not catching a flight at that point so we could stand our ground), did they take off the excess charge. I suspect the next person will pick up that car, still with only one blemish noted and if they don't check and take photos themselves, they will be charged.\n\nIf there was a no star option for this review, I'd be using it. In my opinion this company uses underhand tactics to get more money from you and I do not trust them. If you do use them, check and question EVERYTHING."

      "text": "Hired a car in October / November 2023. Mistakenly drove car through a \"bus only during specified hours\" lane on two occasions. As a tourist, and being unfamiliar with the area, these things happen. Not unexpectedly, an infringement notice issued for each, which I duly paid.\nHowever I received a message from AMEX that Europcar trying to take £40 out of my account (twice). Very sneaky trying to take money out of my credit card without even asking me or telling me what is for. AMEX blocked the payments. When Europcar eventually notified me, they said this was a \"processing fee\" for each infringement notice, asserting this is representative of the \"loss and damage\" they suffered as a consequence of the occurrence. What a crock! They suffered no loss. The fine itself was £70, reducing to £35 if paid promptly. I have paid the reduced fine so the \"processing fee\" exceeds the fine!\nThe claim amounts to a \"penalty\" which would be unenforceable under UK law, despite what the Europcar Ts and Cs suggest to the contrary. The scam works because it is cheaper for us poor mugs who live overseas to cough up rather than be followed up by a bunch of debt recovery lawyers.\nBeware!\n---------------------------------------------------------------\nUPDATE:\nEuropcar has responded to me inviting me to click on a link and send a message. I have done so but the messaging facility initially appeared to be non-functional. It's not helping their case. My booking number is 1165411709. I invited them to contact me via my email address on their file. They did not. Their lawyers did send me another message however.\nThe \"contact\" link is now functional, and I have contacted Europcar direct as requested. They say they will respond in seven days.\n_________________________________________________\nResponse received on 13 March. Consultant was unhelpful, relying on the standard terms and conditions as the basis for the charges."

But thank God I document of days with my phone and took pictures. Because this morning I had a message on my bank account that Europcar trying to take £40 out of my account apparently like I said the car wasn’t full when it got here. It went back with the same mileage left in range.!!!! They are very sneaky trying to take money out of my bank without even asking me or telling me what is for. I am absolutely disgusted in the company doing this normally has it cause me stress an alarm because the bank has now temporarily shut my account because of them, I have two children by myself all time now, I cannot access any of my own money in my account.

      "text": "My boyfriend booked a car for Malta through Europcar as advertised through the website. He made this booking over the phone and received a confirmation email of the booking.\n\nWe arrived in Malta to be told that our car was given to another person because our flight was delayed by 1 hour and that to give us a new car it would cost an extra 81euros and extra 800euro deposit. They explained that because we had not given our flight number they didn't save the car for us.\n\nWhen my boyfriend had originally booked the flight over the phone this detail was not given by the europcar assistant and this was not stated in the email. Therefore this is the mistake of Europcar.\n\nWe straight away rang Europcar and they said they couldnt get us a car because they werent associated with the Malta branch.... They said they would refund the initial booking.\n\nThankfully we could travel by taxi, this was an extra cost to us... they offered no solution. This could have been catastrophic if in a different location and a different time.\n\nAfter out holiday we contacted Europcar because we had heard nothing about the refund. Europcar then told us that they had investigated the matter and we had to pay 95Euros for the cancellation... which we never made and not previously been told.\n\nThis is not what they told us on the day that we arrived in Malta, why then would we have chosen to cancel for 95euros when we could have just paid 81euros for the other vehicle....\n\nSo now we have paid 81Euros for the initial booking and 95euros for \"the cancellation\", for a car that we never got to use because of Europcars bad organisation. This is an absolute scam, Eruopcar have offered no resolution. Would not recommend, and would avoid at all costs."

      "text": "I hired a car from Edinburgh airport recently with Europcar via Rentalcars. I took out extra insurance of around £45 and total bill was just over £200.\nI was tired and had had a bad journey with my first flight so late I nearly missed my connection to Edinburgh, and I had to wait to be seen by the agent with europcar. I had all my paperwork, passport, driving licence, credit card. I was asked if I wanted an automatic car, but when I was told that it would be an extra £25 a day I said no. I was hiring for 9;days. When I went to sign the paperwork I noticed it said estimated cost £425 ! I asked about this and was assured that it was only an estimate. It was a case of sign here, here, here. I returned the car duly after the time. Only when I got my credit card bill 2 weeks later that I found that I had been charged an extra daily charge for insurance\n, amounting to £264.24. I immediately phone europcar and they said as I had signed nothing they could do. They put the phone down on me saying they couldn’t hear me. Rentalcars refunded my insurance though.\nI was never asked about this insurance as I already had it. It was added by the agent with no authority from me. I have written to complain several times with an unacceptable answer.\nThe agent called from Edinburgh airport and when I challenged him he said client services will sort it. I asked for his name and he put the phone down but n me!\nI just want the £264.24 refunded as it was missold to me. Europcar can afford to do this. I cannot afford this extra charge which I never was asked about or consented to.\nI will never use them again."

Europcar's repair records show they received a 10% discount on replacement parts, however, this discount was omitted from our invoice with the replacement parts charged in full. Resulting in an overcharge of 200 euro before VAT.\nAssuming this was a mistake, we advised Europcar the invoice should reflect the discounted repair cost that they paid. Instead of an honest response, we have endured months of back and forth emails where Europcar have made every effort to deceive us. First they suggested we were getting confused about the damage excess, waiver exclusions and even VAT. After sending them screenshots of their own documents, highlighting the section with \"repair cost, discount, corrected repair cost\", they responded with the same screenshot but cropped to only show the \"repair cost\" and stated they don't understand where we are seeing a discount in their records!!!\nI am baffled by Europcar's blatant effort to twist their own records to profiteer from us. All other efforts to reach a resolution has resulted in 3rd parties just copying and pasting Europcar's rhetoric of \"we have discussed this at length, the invoice is correct, pay it\". We have succumb after receiving threats of legal action, which are not worth contesting as our agreement was Austria based. Instead I will never book with Europcar again and continue to warn others of their behavior.\nRental agreement: 3502028742 (22/02/23)\nDamage invoice: 48000-166/23 (15/11/23)"

We were told to take photos of damage at colleciton but after an initial inspection there was nothing of note. We returned the car in exactly the same condition at the end of the week and then received an email demanding payment. The photos of the car show a tiny 3 inch scuff to an unpainted bumper which could only be seen from a foot away if you crouched on the floor.\n\nIt's important to emphasize that this issue hardly qualifies as \"damage\" – it's more akin to a minor blemish, a common occurrence on vehicles, including rental cars. Rather than incurring additional costs pursuing us, the reasonable approach would have be to continue renting the car in its current condition, documenting the tiny imperfection in your inspection records, as is typically done with most vehicles in your fleet.\n\nYour continued pursuit for payment appears to be a predatory business practice, not driven by actual incurred costs but rather indicative of excessive corporate profiteering. The exorbitant fee includes of €442 for labor associated with this minor blemish is both offensive and unreasonable. The actual labor required for such a minor issue is a fraction of this cost. Therefore, not only are you trying to hold us responsible for damage we did not cause, but you are also attempting to overcharge us with highly disproportionate labor fees.\n\nDespite months of correspondence with customer services nothing has been done and I have been repeatedly chased for payment which has now been passed to a debt collection agency and have not had any response to my last email. This issue has dragged on for over 6 months. A total disgrace."

      "text": "I have experienced numerous problems with Europcar, it’s clear to me that their whole business model relies on trying to impose unjustified chrges. I recently returned a Europcar rental and ensured that I refilled the petrol tank less than 0.5 mile from the branch. I even got a statement of return acknowledging that I’d returned the car with a full tank of petrol. Not to miss an opportunity Europcar still decided that they would charge me for refuelling siting a decidedly dodgy telemetry report. I know that I refuelled, the Europcar rep at the branch saw that I had refuelled but they insisted that an obviously dodgy telemetry report proved that I hadn’t. There was clearly something wrong with the report and when I pointed this out to Europcar they doubled down on the lie that I returned the car without refuelling. I felt gaslighted. This is the third issue in my last 3 rentals that I’ve experienced problems with Europcar including 2 unjust charges , they are nothing short of crooks. Hook you in with cheap up front costs and then hit you with unjust charges."

As well as this, a daily hire went from £23 to £41 , and having been a customer for two months they clearly have no desire to retain customers and loyalty isn’t in their vocabulary. They will also take money from your card without reason, and don’t return deposits. More concerning is they will potentially provide you with an unsafe vehicle that on several occasions nearly caused an accident on the motorway due to a steering problem. Not safe. Please avoid this business, their booking department are extremely unhelpful."

The first call went so far as to say, take my bank card and driver's licence and I would be charged £5.00 for a driver check code licence, which was ridiculous as I do these daily at work, and a free service from the government available to anyone, so I printed this myself to save a further £5.00.\n\nI have used you before, I have paid my bills and my credit score is decent, so there is no issue on what was about to happen. I have taken various driving courses at Volvo when I worked for them, so I am a pretty good driver, and I have never returned any of your vehicles with dings, scratches, or issues. So there should not be an issue there. I returned my rentals early before, so there is no issue there.. And funny enough the guy at the depot could not even find my account when I first arrived, so why would I be on DNR?..\n\nMy rental was due to start at 10am this morning, I am moving as previously stated, I am a single mum, with two children and 1 income so money is tight, I put my last bit of money into getting this van.\nI walked in a little early, the guy did not greet me.\nHe started processing my application stating I would need to put a deposit down, I said I paid extra so I would not have to, and he asked for my driver's licence and took my check code information another customer came in. At this point, he said you are on our DNR list you are not taking a vehicle we cannot hire to you.\n\nI was in shock and said what?\n\nHe said we can't hire to you, you are on do not rent and we can't give you a vehicle. I said what am I meant to do, I am moving today, you have my money, are you going to refund my money now so I can go get another van, he said no it takes 7-10 days, I said this does not help me, I said this is ridiculous I have used you before and not had issues with your car but this is now the second time you have messed me about at a time when I need you. I need my money. He was not going to help me.\n\nI went out and called the number who I called during the week, they washed their hands of me and passed me to another number they said they would put me on an emergency refund, they could not tell me why there was a DNR again my name. I said that is not helping me today. I need to get my stuff out of my house and into a new home what am I meant to do? She said she could not tel me why I was on a DNR, I asked why, and when was my money coming I have to get a van today, I was still in shock I have to move I was hoping someone had this wrong and would say go back go get your van.. At this point the woman started hello can you hear me rubbish...\n\nI don't deserve what I went through today, I paid for and worked hard to pay for a van rental today, to be treated like that was appalling.. AVOID THEM LIKE THE PLAGUE!!!"

It turned out the engine cover was not screwed on properly and had come loose. I was stranded for nearly 4 hours at a motorway service station while they sent the AA to fix it. Not only did they refuse to give me any compensation (save a joke of a 5% voucher off \"my next Europcar rental\"), but now it turns out they're holding me responsible for a fine for overstaying the free parking at the service station, and are threatening me with legal action if I don't also pay them (Europcar) an admin fee. After a long and exhausting exchange with Europcar Customer Services they refuse to bear any responsibility for the consequences of having rented me a faulty car which placed me in a potentially dangerous situation and delayed my journey by 4 hours. They may look a little cheaper than other car hire companies but it's a false economy. Stay away."

The driver delivered the courtesy car to my house but didn't ask for my signature, instead, he just inserted the keys into my front door mailbox and left. Ridiculously Europcar requested that I personally deliver the signed documents to their office (your employee did not ask me to sign the document in person, and now you are requesting me to personally deliver the document back to your office? Is this the proper way to treat a customer?).\n\nAfterward my car is repaired, the garage delivered it back to my home without notice, and the staff of garage said he will drive the courtesy car back to their garage. Europcar will directly retrieve the courtesy car from their garage (I just immigrated to the UK, and I don't know if this is a normal practice, but the driver emphasize that it is normal in the UK, said no worries).\n\nTwo days later, I received an invoice from Europcar by email which is charging me for petrol fees. I can understand this, but when I returned home that day, I only discovered that the driver said he need to take the courtesy car away. At that time, I didn't think about returning the car with a full tank of petrol, and then I received a very unreasonable fuel charge.\n\nI sent two emails to Europcar to express my dissatisfaction and explain the situation when I returned the courtesy car (I understand that I need to return the courtesy car with a full tank of petrol, but the problem is I had no idea the garage driver would suddenly ask to take it away). I requested that the fuel cost be charged based on the actual market price, but I did not receive any response. After that, I returned to my hometown for three weeks. I did not receive any email, phone call, or SMS reminder from Europcar during that period.\n\nWhen I returned to the UK, I received a letter from Shakespeare Martineau which is pursuing the debt on behalf of Europcar, with a late payment charge of £40. From day one I have never received an original invoice from Europcar, only electronic ones, which do not mention any penalties for late payment.\n\nI finally settled the invoice payment to Shakespeare Martineau before the deadline. At the same time, I emailed the payment receipt to Europcar and Shakespeare Martineau, emphasizing repeatedly that the £40 late payment charge is unreasonable. I won't bear this unreasonable charge.\n\nTwo weeks have passed and I just received an email from Shakespeare Martineau, saying that I haven't paid the outstanding debt. Today, I called Europcar to inquire about it, but the staff said they don’t know what’s happening and asked me to call another number for further information. And then I waited for 20 minutes, and in the end, they asked me to leave a message saying they would call me back.\n\nI have been living in the UK for 2 years, and sincerely, many of my friends have had to contact insurance companies for claims due to traffic accidents. Many of them say that Marshmallow Insurance Company's handling of insurance claims is poor. I really didn't expect it to be this bad. I am the victim, my car got hit. The other party says it's a company car and asks me to claim compensation from their insurance company. I didn't expect that later on, Marshmallow, the law firm and Europcar would all constantly seek opportunities to charge fees from me or the other party. This is simply an all-in-one scam that insurance companies have taken advantage of government regulatory loopholes and expanded. Under the guise of claims insurance, actually providing various services under different pretexts and then charging exorbitant and unreasonable fees.\n\nI will give Europcar a negative review and raise awareness to their opaque operations. In any situation, whenever individuals file a claim with their insurance company, it is always the citizens who end up being the victims while these businesses benefit."

The 'nice' lady gave me a free upgrade and didn't try to up sell me, was very pleased with the car and experience initially. Imagine my surprise when I received an invoice from them after I returned the car to discover I had been charged for 3 days premium insurance! Wasn't even mentioned when I collected the car, she just added it to my credit card. Of course this is all my fault for not thoroughly checking what I was signing for, she lulled me into thinking they were an honest company. Taught me a £92 (over twice the car price) lesson! I'm sure this is fraud. I complained but of course as I signed they said I must have agreed to the verbal agreement. Am recommending to everyone to avoid!"

I am writing to express my disappointment with my recent car rental experience at Faro Airport.Upon booking the car rental for six days, I was quoted a price of £84 pounds, which seemed reasonable and within my budget. However, upon arriving at your office at the airport, I was informed of additional charges that were not initially disclosed. These included insurance fees and road tax for motorways, amounting to an extra £128 on top of the initial price.This unexpected increase in charges came as a surprise and was quite disappointing. As a customer, I value transparency and clear communication when it comes to pricing and fees. It's disheartening to encounter hidden costs that significantly impact the overall expense of the rental.I want to emphasize the importance of transparent pricing and upfront disclosure of all fees associated with the rental. Customers should be fully informed of the total cost before making a decision to proceed with the booking. Such transparency not only fosters trust but also allows customers to make informed choices.Unfortunately, this experience has left me feeling dissatisfied, and I must say that I will not be considering your services for any future car rentals. I hope that you will take this feedback constructively and consider implementing measures to ensure transparent pricing practices in the future.Thank you for your attention to this matter"

Despite raising these concerns, the company was uncooperative, refusing to replace the faulty vehicle. They suggested contacting the AA due to the vehicle’s faults, yet when the AA validated the issues and was unable to transport the car due to the absence of a flatbed, the company inaccurately accused me of refusing to allow the vehicle to be taken.\n\nThe absurdity of not wanting a malfunctioning vehicle that I had repeatedly requested to be swapped is beyond frustrating. It feels like my concerns are falling on deaf ears.

Oh and don't try to call this branch, even the Europcar assistance cannot reach them as they never pick up the phone. They say they value their reputation but this is honestly the second time (on 3 rentals) I had the most frustrating and infuriating customer experience with them.

The moral of the story check the excess as the standard excess is 1600 pounds. As if that wasnt bad enough they added strange surchages to my bill for example a premium station surchage and other licence fees. These were not expected or explained.

Not to be trusted.\n\nMy response to Europcar's reply below:\n\nI have not heard anything sincere from Europcar since I reported the incident to Europcar Customer Care two months ago. And because I am now writing down my negative experience on Trustpilot, Europcar comes up with a meaningless reply to keep up appearances. Superficial kindness is no compensation for poverty of character."

Using CarJet I booked a \"compact\" vehicle with KEDDY car hire & took out the CarJet 'zero excess' insurance cover with Avia to avoid the much more expensive one using Keddy.\nThe pick up was at South terminal Gatwick, at the EUROPCAR desk. ALL the paperwork was in the name of Europcar with no mention of Keddy at all.\nI was given the agreement to sign, and my credit card was charged with 'a holding charge' at NO time was I offered any insurance regarding 'zero excess' OR informed that I had taken this out. Had this been the case I would have refused as I already had cover in place. On reaching my daughters about 3 hours later I thought that the 'holding charge' seemed an odd amount ( £383)? On looking at the agreement, it appeared that I had been charged for Europcars PREMIUM 'zero excess' insurance. I immediately (only 3 hours after picking the car up) rang customer services, explained the situation and asked for the Isurance charge to be removed. The agent said she would report my request to an investigating agent and they would be in touch. I recieved an email with a case number. The hire was for 10 days, and after 8 days the 'pending payment' dissapeared from my credit card statement. Case closed I thought, although I had recieved no more communication from 'customer services'. The day after returning home a 'pending payment' once again appeared on my credit card, this time for £325! Once again on to 'customer services' a prolonged phone call, and being told that the case had been closed,I asked the agent to open a new one, which he did. I will say that the two agents at Customer Services were both courtious and as far as it goes 'understanding'\nI consider that the desk agent at Gatwick however, did dupe me into signing the agreement, which of course DID contain the insurance agreement. With my signiture on that agreement,of course it gives me no option of claiming a 'non authorized' payment with my credit card issuer.\nWhen doing research into Europcar, I found out that they also own GOLDCAR car hire, which in Spain is notorious for similar bad service and underhand actions."

They sent an invoice saying that we were now owed £39 and it would take 10 days to get back. I waited 15 and got nothing. When I called he said he had to reissue the refund. It will take another 10 days. They have now just taken another £39 from my bank. They now owe me double what they were supposed to!\n\nIt’s like theft!

No alternative vehicle available so asked for an immediate refund. You take money immediately and then take forever to return it back. The deposit you took of 288 pounds has still not been released even after all that has happened. Why do you treat customers like this. Seriously on a global scale the interest you must earn on holding deposits and delayed refunds must be huge. But when a customer has had a bad experience and you choose to hold on to their money after a bad experience is disgusting and unethical"

Prepare to lose a lot of time making enquiries with no voluntary updates. Also be prepared for extortionate admin charges should you receive a parking ticket (£32.90). Their website reads ... \"Where Europcar Mobility Group receive a fine that was not settled when issued, the total cost of the fine, plus an administration fee, will be charged to the main driver’s credit card\". My particular fee, which isn't mentioned, was applied just for providing driver details ... on top of the parking charge which I settled when issued. There will be a generic Trustpilot response suggesting contacting customer services. Europcar customer services, in my experience, are a brusque lot intent on exploiting every opportunity for additional revenue rather than focusing on customer care and return custom. Expect generic replies, referring to T&Cs and to be patronised. Actually that is inaccurate. The definition of patronise is \"To treat in a way that is apparently kind or helpful but that betrays a feeling of superiority\". Forget the \"apparently kind and helpful\" part.

When we arrived to collect our car they had given it away. This was very late at night and we then had absolutely no choice but to accept an ‘upgrade’ at an additional cost of £240! Calling it an upgrade was a joke in itself, the windscreen wiper on the driver side was damaged and you could argue illegal! Their first suggestion was a tiny car, now as we were stood there with a massive snowboard bag you would assume that was just an entirely stupid suggestion. Driving on the autobahn with no wiper was incredibly dangerous and meant us stopping several times to try and fix it. This is after spending about an hour debating with the totally useless assistant on the desk about getting a car. Customer service is non existent. I suspect a cheap call centre somewhere with standard replies. The team on the desk were hideous to deal with too.\nReading a lot of the comments on here and on social media there seems to be a theme of lack of customer service, but also, and more worrying, a culture of charging people who have no choice or chance of getting any money back. For a business that is big, they seem worse than some back street rental company!\n\nNever again!\n\nEdit in reply to Europcar comment!\n\nI have tried contacting your customer services team and contacting you via social media. Your social team can’t help as they just manage your social apparently! Your customer services sent me the same standard reply and were entirely useless. I suspect most people on here who you have responded to in order to appear helpful to others have had the same experience as me!"

Appalling, distressful & worrying experience because of their mindless inflexibility, poor training & totally inadequate software. Europcar operates on 2 rules, 1 - they are always right, 2 if they are wrong see rule 1. The mindlessness & complacency of computer bureaucracy. No-one listens, no-one checks, no-one helps.\nDue to Europcar's totally inadequate & inflexible soft ware & the total NFI of all in Central Reservations we got incorrectly classed as off-hire. We tried for 3 days to put it right - we tried, not them. Then, after just 72 hours the computer generated threatening emails started - they'll destroy our credit rating & send the police in if we don't do what we've be trying to do for the last 3 days in 24 hrs. Nobody has taken into account our efforts at all. More phoning of useless numbers. In the end the folks at the local branch sorted it & we had to visit them in person & it took them nigh on 2 hrs of creative thinking to do it. They were brilliant - treated us like human beings & valued customers. They even gave the car a quick wash. Can't thank them, at the branch only, enough\nAnd this is the 2nd time that Europcar have demonstrated how little they care for their customers & their mindless stupidity has resulted in someone threatening us for something we didn't do. The 1st time? Last year they gave our personal details to a debt collection agency for an incident involving a PREVIOUS renter of the car we were driving. There followed 2 months of threatening letters from the agency - police, court cases, bailiffs & NO-ONE, ABSOLUTELY NO-ONE listening to us again. In the end I had to track down the head of the agency & explain it to him & it worked but get Europcar to listen & help get us out of the muck they've dropped us in - FORGET IT."

We were relieved to find a van on their website big enough for our move and had our time slot booked in for 9am and had also payed on the website before hand. Arrived at the site at 9am on our move in day, to be greeted by one of their employees. We were made to fill in some details and then we were told that they didn’t have our van. When questioned on this, he had claimed to have rang me the night before 3-4 times to let us know that there was no van, however checking my call log, there was no missed calls. I explained this to the man and asked him to check the number on the system - it was the correct number. I had shown the call log to the man and he just kind of shrugged his shoulders as if to say there was nothing he could do. He then gave us recommendations for other places, trying to put them down by saying they’ll be way move expensive, ironically as if we’ll take the non existent van from them for their price. He then said he would give us a refund “charge free” for the mix up. Too right!!!! Such a let down and put a huge damper on our special day. Thank god for Enterprise - saved the day for us! Would not recommend to anyone, and for those who will still go ahead with this company, make sure you ring up the day before AND the day of to double check they actually have your vehicle."

In 2 past disputes, I could only get my money back via the credit card's \"chargeback\" process. You may ask: why did he book Europcar? I had good experiences in Amsterdam and Sligo (Ireland).

This is a NO GO even if the car has AWD and it's absolutely illegal in many countries all over the world (but not in the UK).\nI came back and asked to be given another car and price difference refunded.\nI had to go on the parking slot for 1 hour to find the only car that had M+S (mud and snow) stamp on the tyre side-wall (the rest was a disaster with plenty of cars with 3 different summer tires and none of them had all season tyres).\nI said i want that one. It was an MG EHS Hybrid.\nPlease refund me the price difference.\nAfter pushing me to take all sort of insurance i told her i only want the bare minimum, i don't need all that crap.\nIn the end she charged me 1,387.50£ which was still more than 2 times the price that i was supposed to pay for almost the same car. MG EHS is a budget family SUV car that is worth 37,000€ in Belgium when bought new. In no way it can cost the double of a Mercedes CLA 200 AMG Line to be rented that costs 50,000eur.\nThis is a clear SCAM.\nOf course i couldn't check what the correct price would have been within their parameters by making a simulation online in their website but i knew i was definitely for sure getting scammed and i had no other choice than pay and go away.\nWhen i left the desk, after a few meters i see behind my shoulders the lady laughing with his colleague talking about me and laughing loudly, almost having a laughter.\nI have travelled all over the world, dealt with many renting companies like sixt, avis, europcar. But the very despicable way i was treated by this europcar agency is simply out of this world.\nSHAMEFUL!

I was given a very scuffed car which was impossible to evidence all of the scuffs, scratches and dents on the documentation. I was advised that anything under 5 cm was not documented. I thought at the time, they are going to blame me some of these on me... I was told at the desk that if I had a puncture, this was not covered by roadside assistance. At the car I asked about this and was advised there is a kit in the boot. We checked and there was not one! He fetched one... Another alarm bell was, I knew I was returning the car at 4am, out of hours with no one available to verify the state of the car. Again, I thought they are going to blame me for some of these scuffs. I took photographs before leaving and on returning... But guess what? They are trying to charge me for damage I did not do. I can not report any outcome as I am still pursuing this. They have not yet taken money from my credit card, but my goodness... they can look out if they do... Obviously, no more custom from me! Beware people, of this very disgraceful scam. I will post this on a Europcar for Portugal if I can find one.\n24 Jan 2024 Update: this has now been resolved. To take my money for something I didn't do would have been fraud. Pity they put me through the stress of all of this. For this reason, I will avoid Europcar in future."

I am currently in dispute with them to get some of my money back because unfortunately for them I have photographic proof that they are liars and thieves and will take what they will from their customers, I will never hire from them again nor will I recommend and if anyone says they are thinking about going to europcar I will tell them to go somewhere else!"

I was told at Europecar counter that the car cannot be released because my Northern Ireland license could not be verified through some cluncky website that did not work. Nothing about this was mentioned when I bought the rental and paid up front. I ended up having to buy another expensive premium insurance package before the car was released. Extremely stressful experience that ruined my holiday. Avoid Europecar and CarTrawler if you want peace of mind and you don't want the stress of being ripped off by these scavengers.\n\nUpdate 15/1/2024: As can be seen by the reply from Europcar they are happy to pass the blame to CarTrawler, who in turn pass the blame to Europcar. As a customer you would be best place to avoid both these companies that are happy to take your money and then point fingers at the other party. The customer is the loser at the end of the day!"

I bought a cable and was able to use it so this was not a problem. It drove fine but the windscreen wipers needed replacing and the right headline needed replacing (not good in the weather conditions over Christmas).\n\nThe following morning I went to set off on a day trip to find the middle seat belt didn't work. I had to drive for one hour with a passenger loose in the car. I called into Europcar to see what the problem was with the seat belt. They told me it was faulty and couldn't send me home in the car or they would be liable. They then gave me another car. This one didn't have a working car play either and it required a different cable. It was late at night, raining and dark. I had no idea how to drive home and didn't want to with my children in the car when I had no idea where I was going. They agreed and offered me a third car. I had to wait for this car to be refuelled. When it arrived, I transferred my luggage again. Did the paperwork, again. Got my baby in the car, again. The middle passenger then got in to discover there was no seat belt. The staff had a look and couldn't find a seat belt. I had to get my baby back out and all the luggage while they looked.\nAfter thorough searching with no luck, they decided to offer me a fourth car. Whilst transferring my luggage, they finally found the seat belt on the third car.\n\nBy this time, we had been there for 2 hours. My children were cold, hungry and tired. I took the third car. I explained to the staff that I would be making a formal complaint. The service I received was shocking. However, the worst part is that I was given two cars that had clearly not been checked properly. I had to drive off in a car that I didn't feel was safe, with my children inside. The staff are always very keen to check for bumps and scratches but is anybody actually checking the safety of these vehicles? Clearly not."

      "text": "I was charged for an upgraded vehicle I had not booked nor requested, nor informed would incur an additional cost. My signed copy of the agreement makes no mention of upgrade costs. Their signed copy does. I accept that I could have read the 4 page document more thoroughly before signing, however with 10 people in queue behind me it didn't seem prudent at the time. When I queried the additional charge later I was made to feel like an idiot by the person on the phone and then hung up on mid-sentence. I had not raised my voice, nor been aggressive. It's not the cost. It's the immense disrespect shown by the phone operator when I queried it that concerns me. I had read many reviews about the customer service being very poor but assumed it was just angry, irrational customers. I now know those reviews to be true and made by rational people like me who were treated extremely poorly."

      "text": "Europcar were asked, by Zurich Insurance, to provide a car similar to an Audi SQ7 while mine was being fixed. The first Europcar representative offered a Mercedes GLE (not really the same standard as the SQ7), then put us in touch with the local Europcar provider (Oxford Prestige) who then said the nicest/largest car they had available was a Volvo XC40. We agreed that they would arrive at 11am as I had a meeting at 10am. They arrived at 10:15am in the middle of the meeting and said I could just sign a form to take the car. The form stated 'No damage'. I inspected the car (taking photos and video) and found many chips and paintwork blemishes. I did not have time to look inside the car. Later this was found to be dirty, smelt of strong air-freshener and had exposed wires under the seats which my children were able to grab.\n\nEuropcar requested feedback through a website, which I provided and they asked if I would like to post my review on-line. On selecting this option, it redirected me to the French Trust Pilot site.\n\nIf your insurer recommends Europcar to provide any kind of courtesy vehicle, I suggest you ask them if they have an alternative provider."

To summarise: 1) Europcar tell us to refill car to 3/4 full when we pick up the car, 2) Europcar do not fill in our Rental Agreement sheet to confirm this (we have photos), 3) Europcar then charge us £40 days after our return citing fuel charges, 4) I complain on Trustpilot as this directly contravenes what we were told and our paperwork, 5) Europcar reply on trustpilot and tell us to contact customer service, 6) I contact customer service and clearly submit my arguments with photo evidence that they did not fill in our form.\n\nThis latest interaction (dated today 3/1/2024) is where is gets even more ridiculous. WITHOUT EVEN A HINT OF IRONY Europecar reply to my customer service request with an £0.85p refund. They do not address the clear issue at hand – that they did not fill in our form, and that the only guide we got was the fuel gauge on check in (it was 3/4 full) and what the lady told us (“refill it to 3/4 full”).\n\nIf this is how they make their money then they should be sanctioned.\n\nI am going to keep responding to customer service and publish each response on trustpilot until they repay me my money.\n\nBooking #1169913230\nCase # 18577994"

      "text": "I originally booked a car using my credit card at the price of 127.32 pounds for two days. When we went to pick up the car, the agent told us that we could have an upgrade at a heavily discounted price of 50 pounds per days in the spirit of Christmas. And because my partner also asked the agent to cancel my original payment and use his credit card instead, we did not notice anything wrong when he got charged. However, we have now noticed that both of us have been charged, totalling more than twice the cost of our original booking. Also to our disbelief, the invoice listed the agent’s quote as an upgrade IN ADDITION to the original cost.\n\nI find it completely unacceptable as we did not expect to pay more than twice the amount for an upgrade that we had thought was offered to us as a gesture of goodwill. I would like to request a refund of the upgrade.\n\nP.S. got reply from their customer service rep who simply told me that they had charged the correct amount and the upgrade indeed cost over 50 pounds EXTRA. It's ridiculous given that the agent told us that she was giving us a half price discount and the cost of similar models are going for only about 100 pounds per day based on their website. Besides, should the agent have pointed out that my orignal visa payment was not going to be reversed as requested and the upgrade would cost more than DOUBLE the original price? It's pure greed and deceit. I will continue to escalate this matter."

      "text": "I've been a loyal Europcar customer for a decade, entrenched in their \"privilege\" program. Little did I anticipate the day I'd find myself compelled to compose such a review and sever ties with this company.\nThe Norwich office, once a paragon of exemplary customer care, manned by individuals genuinely invested in their roles and clientele, has regrettably lost its former luster.\nIn a recent incident, I scheduled a car rental for collection at 11:00 am today, to be returned on January 2nd. Arriving at the Norwich Europcar station ten minutes prior to the appointed time, I was informed, to my dismay, that there were no available cars, necessitating a 30-minute wait. The staff member at the desk, a commendable professional I had dealt with for years, suggested an automatic car as an alternative, a proposal to which I acquiesced with gratitude.\nMy husband and I took a brief stroll and returned after 30 minutes. Although the documents were prepared and the contract duly signed, I was informed of an additional 15-minute delay. Patiently, I waited, only to find that after the specified time had elapsed, there was still no progress. Approaching the desk for an update, I was met with an unexpected turn of events.\nA recently recruited staff member, a young woman I had encountered on a few occasions but never interacted with directly, made a call and casually informed me of an extra 10-minute delay. In jest, I remarked, \"Maybe I should consider AVIS next time,\" given their proximity at Norwich airport. In response, she retorted, dripping with condescension, \"You are welcome to go.\"\nIncensed but still patient, I endured another 10 minutes before deciding to abandon the endeavor. Fortunately, the same experienced employee who had initially assisted me promptly canceled my booking without imposing any charges. It became apparent that he understood my frustration after waiting an exasperating 90 minutes for nothing.\nAs the Managing Director of a company in London, I can unequivocally state that any team member uttering \"you are welcome to go\" to a customer would swiftly find themselves out of the office. This holds especially true if the customer's remark was light-hearted and well-intentioned.\nIt's disheartening to witness Europcar discard their stellar employees, who epitomized customer-centric values, in favour of individuals lacking in both manners and comprehension of what \"customer care\" entails. After more than a decade of patronage, I've decided to make a change. If Europcar demonstrates indifference towards its customers, why should customers reciprocate with care for the company?"

Despite explicitly stating I do not wish any additional insurances or addons on pickup I was charged 110 GBP after the rental for several things like breakdown insurance, driver insurance etc. I already contacted customer support and they were unwilling to help in the matter. Very unfortunate that I will have to resort to a credit card chargeback. Clerks are trimmed to try and hide extra charges so you sign the contract without noticing them. It is bad enough they try this with people who do not know about this but it is REALLY bad when you explicitly decline and they still put it on the contract and then hide the section by conveniently placing another sheet of paper on top of that section of the contract. I only noticed until after I signed but then it was \"too late\" because I had already started the rental. I thought this was a reputable company... Stay away from Europcar!"

Unfortunately, my rental on 7.12/8.12 was marred by several issues that need urgent attention.\n\n1. The van was provided with an empty screen wash, and upon its return to your garage, I was informed that a broken pipe was the cause. This oversight is unacceptable and raises concerns about the maintenance standards of your fleet. (The manager of the Bristol branch came outside and noted the faults in person)\n\n2. The wiper blades were below the legal limit, causing damage to the screen and functioning with noticeable shuddering issues. This not only compromised visibility but also posed safety risks during my journey.\n\n3. The AdBlue levels were low, triggering warning sounds that indicated the need for topping up. Proper maintenance should have prevented this issue, ensuring a smooth and safe driving experience.\n\n4. The near-side front indicator was not operational, posing a safety hazard and indicating a lack of quality checks before releasing the van for hire.\n\n5. The driver’s overhead cabin section contained a mouldy banana and half-eaten doughnuts. The foul smell became apparent only after driving with the heating on. This lack of cleanliness is unprofessional and unpleasant for customers.\n\n6. Further complicating matters, the plumbing piping within the vehicle’s wall lining was visibly old and retained smelly water, causing damage to personal belongings. I brought this issue to the attention of your manager during my visit to the garage.\n\np.s we only became aware of the above when we were a distance from the rental premise and committed with moving house"

When the car didn't show up I started to make phone calls to Europcar to find out where the car was. I made several attempts to telephone call but each time I was held in queue with no one answering. Also tried to email but no immediate response. So got a work colleague to drive me the the Europcar center in Cambridge to pick up car only to find that they hired the car to someone else and they didn't have any other cars available for a couple of days. Apparently the Cambridge Europcar office had tried to phone me in advance for a verification check but they claimed the telephone number was incorrect. Yet on my email confirmation from Europcar my contact number was the correct one. So in summary I received an extremely poor service from Europcar and would therefore not recommend."

It’s take FOUR weeks to refund it but has then charged him over £100 for the car when we paid £84 online?! Then after specifically telling them we didn’t want the extra insurance they charged it!!! Saying he signed to agree but we was literally waved a phone to sign with nothing on it. Which I can see happens a lot based on the other reviews here. Absolute JOKE of a company.

The thing that made me really angry is that it wasn't mentioned on checkout. The employee just waved his mobile phone at me and asked me to sign in the box with no explanation of what I was signing for. I only found out about the fuel charge two days later when I received the invoice via email. Luckily I have photos from when I picked the car up that shows the fuel gauge reading 7/8 when they said it was full. It looks like the gauge on the car under-reads. But there's no way they could have put 6 more litres in the tank after I returned it, which is what I was charged for. Annoying experience that could've been avoided by either a) being aware that the gauge on their car under-reads or b) having the conversation at checkout rather than just smiling, pretending everything is fine and then hitting me with a charge the next day."

Never had an issue with a UK car rental company, until now - Merry Christmas I guess.\n- we pick up a car.\n- lady at the reception tells us to fill fuel back to existing level (3/4 full) on return.\n- on return 3 days later, we check the paperwork to double check, before going to petrol station.\n- the paper work does not stipulate level of petrol at check in, so we take the word of the kind lady at reception, and fill it back to 3/4 on the nose. I have a photo of our rental agreement and the staff did not circle the fuel status…\n-we arrive at drop of point to an unstaffed unit (all other companies had people there helping). No problem, we drop the keys in the letterbox and go get our flight.\n- two days later we receive a charge of £20 for fuel, and £18 to fill up plus tax, so another £40+ quid. Apparently we need to fill it to the top? Despite it being only 3/4 full when we got it? Is this really the policy? If yes this is a total scam\n\nAs I say, we have a photo of rental agreement without any direction on fuel level, so hopefully this is resolved quickly.\n\nJust FYI at Edinburgh airport there is an Avis and Budget car rental. We have used those before and never had any issues, they provide clear instruction, and honour their word and do not try and scam their customers. We will be using them next time and suggest anyone reading to as well.\n\nAlso I haven’t even got to the excess cover option on the insurance - at check in they tried to double our rental cost with this (£25 a day!!!).

I was charged for 2 days insurance which was over £40!\n\nI contacted customer service via email and they did eventually reduce my petrol charge (I was 8 litres shy of half way). however they were still charging me for 2 days of insurance.\nI emailed, and eventually called from my home country (Australia) to contest paying for the extra days insurance, was shut down without much explanation beyond - its in the system that way, or we can't look at those records. I have no apparent recourse.\n\nI want to pay what I owe for my error with refuelling and my days insurance, but the bill sits over £33 over as they wont change it.

When I was taken to the van I hired I was not shown the vehicle at all, just given the keys and off to go.\nThe van was in a poor condition, very dirty inside and out. The load only area of the van that was anyway near clean was the floor, the wooden ply on the walls was saturated with an oily substance that came off on anything that touched it. There was only 3/4 of a tank of fuel in the van and the rear number plate light was not working, technically making the van unroadworthy. I was also shocked at being hit with a £20 charge for an out of hours return, as when I booked the van the Europcar website stated that the depot was open until 13:00 on Sunday morning. Since I have returned the van I have been notified that there is damage caused during my rental. I fail to see how the depot can claim that this happened during my rental as the van was in such a poor state when I collected it, I fail to see how they would know of any damage during previous rentals.\nThis is the second time that i have had very poorly prepared vehicles from this depot.\nThe only good thing about this depot is its location close to the station Bristol Temple Meads."

      "text": "An expensive, awful experience. In my opinion, no matter how much you think you may need something moving, or even if you’re just desperate for a vehicle quickly, you should avoid Europcar.\n\nWe rented a van in October this year for a single day & didn't pay for the additional 'premium protection' offered. On the day, the staff at the front desk were helpful and the process of actually picking a vehicle up was quick & easy.\n\nWe were given a much larger van than we had paid for, as this was the only one available & unfortunately I caused some minor damage to the side of the van (knocked off a plastic protector panel with some reflectors).\n\nAfter hearing nothing for 3 months, we finally received a bill from Europcar for £1,500 (the maximum I could be charged) for damage caused; the attached invoices included a figure over £2,000 to fix a small dent in the van!\n\nAnyone with basic knowledge in this area can tell you this is an absurd & ridiculous amount for such a repair. My assumption is that such inflated figures exist purely to ensure people hit their maximum excess when causing damage of any sort.\n\nWe'll never use this company again. Though they've earned so much money just from a 1 day rental, I'm sure they won't mind losing another customer."

      "text": "I had booked a car to pick up at Glasgow airport unfortunately due to airport security checks I ended up missing my flight. I did not want to miss the funeral so I booked another flight into Edinburgh. I made several calls to Euro car hire and asked if I could pick up another car from Edinburgh instead, I was told it was possible but they did not have a similar car so I was told I would pay £15 a day for the upgrade to another vehicle plus one way return charge of £60 if I returned the car to Glasgow. To my surprise I was charged £372.74 for six days after returning the car, in addition to that I had paid for the other car in Glasgow, there is a lot of mis selling especially when someone is in a predicament I was in. It would have been way cheaper for me to get a taxi to Glasgow and pick the car up than that expensive switch I was made to believe was going to cost less. I paid a deposit of £427 which I was told would be refunded within three working days when I called I am told I will be refunded within 10 working days. I was just given a key to collect the car from the bay, no one came to do the physical checks with me, I had to take a video and pictures of the scratches on the car, on the back seat there was semen! When I returned the car I was told the car had scratches, I showed your staff a video and pictures I had taken with a date stamp and the commentary I was making, that's when he apologised, again i was going to be charged. Surely how can you not call that day light robbery? Why do I have to wait for 10 working days to get my deposit back, how is that fair?"

The second time the staff member convinced us to take their insurance with 50% off and guaranteed we would be refunded by Car jet that this happened all the time. The next day doing as he instructed, I contacted Car jet they refused. Upon our return with the car we were told it wasn’t Europcars problem. To add insult to injury they’ve taken more money off the card for the insurance, then we agreed to. I work in hospitality in customer service and there’s one thing I never do and that is rip people off and misinform them. We have been in contact back-and-forth with the company who are just fobbing us off. 35 years I have worked in this industry and it’s the wrong way to treat people.

We will do better next time”\nThere won’t be a next time unless someone refunds me for the missing petrol and compensates me for 3 wasted days trying to keep air in the tyres.\n\nJust so you can make an informed decision in future.\nI rent every two months in Spain. Only used Europcar twice.\nCar had danger warning heading out of BCN. Had to put air in 1 Tyre which was almost flat. It’s hard driving in city so found a garage after 35/40 mins. Couldn’t turn back. Was only there for 3 days.\nHad to leave mountains to put air in Tyre every day. Spoiled my trip.\nCollected tank at 627km thought that was full. It turns out it filled to 1001km so no where near full.\nTried to complain. Staff were so rude I was in tears nearly when I left. They were literally laughing saying they didn’t care as they worked for 3rd party.\nGot this response after making a complaint when I got back.\nBtw they said if I didn’t sign the release form they would keep my fuel deposit too.\n\nThank you for contacting Europcar Customer Services UK.\n\nWe understand that the condition of the vehicle did not meet your expectations, and we deeply regret any inconvenience or disappointment this may have caused.\n\nAt Europcar, we strive to provide our customers with clean and well-maintained vehicles that are in excellent condition. However, it seems that we fell short of our high standards in this particular instance.\n\nWe take customer feedback very seriously, as it helps us identify areas where we can improve our services. Rest assured that we have already taken immediate action to address the issue and prevent any recurrence in the future. Our team is conducting a thorough investigation into what led to this oversight, and appropriate measures will be implemented to ensure that such incidents are avoided going forward.\n\nWhilst I appreciate you have stated that the vehicle didn't come with a full tank, I would be unable to comment further as I was not part of the verbal discussion. As the rental was in Spain, your contractual agreement is with them, we can only act as mediators in instances such as this, so in the event that the two parties are in disagreement our decision can only be based on the documented evidence.\n\nAs the State of return form have been signed, in acceptance of the state of the vehicle upon pick up and drop off, the request for the full of the hire refunded has been respectfully declined. If you need to escalate this further, please contact them directly\n\nPlease accept my sincere apologies for any inconvenience caused by the appearance of the rental vehicle. We value your business and appreciate your understanding in this matter. We remain committed to providing you with exceptional service in the future.\n\n\nRegards,\nAleksandar Slavov\n\nGo with Goldcar in future. Cheaper and much much better customer service. This is appalling from Europcar."

Until around 11:30. So they have already messed up my day.\nSo receive the 23plate car, 2hours later the car goes into limp mode. The stereo isn’t working can’t charge my fone or use satnav.\nI call up told to take it back to purely, get back to purely and am met by hostile workers.\nI had to nurse the car to my partners because I needed to look after our child which I didn’t feel safe bringing in the car!\n20/12/23\nI spend the whole day backwards and forwards with Europcar over their broken car, don’t get anywhere, Mercedes assist comes out to diagnose the car. He said it’s not safe to drive. Back on the fone to europcar, who need to collect the car, then they tell me the car can go to another europcar in Heathrow and they replace the car, I’m told I must tell the recovery driver to take the car there but on the recovery drivers system it says to take it to there yard. Again inconvenienced,\nThe recovery can’t get to me until 2am 21/12/23. Bear in mind I have work the next day. So I leave my partners early hours of this morning to nurse the car to work. On the way it stopped about 10times I kid you not, just made it to work.\nAt this time everyone at europcar I’ve must of spoken too, managers etc told them I need a car today, not until 3pm today after speaking all Wednesday that the manager BOBBY DYLAN that I’ve had to chase up to find a car for me but it’s going to take 1.5hrs to get me to the branch for a car. The branch closes at 4pm. 4PM ON A THURSDAY are you kidding me? Now I’m stuck at work, no car as they collected the car this morning. They won’t pay for my taxi 20mins home, they don’t know who the managers that was in on the 20th 12 2023. I asked for names I’m put on hold. At this point I’m still calm but direct and no disrespect.\nThis company is a joke. I actually use to work for their chauffeur company Brunel. They’re a joke too.\nI’d stay well clear if I was anyone looking to rent a car.\nNow I’m going to ask for a list of every call I made to them since Monday! It’s like 50 calls.\nBunch of jokers.\n\n22/12/12\nWas supposed to receive a call at 9am to arrange a cab to get me to the new hire car, but I’ve had to call them myself and chase this up.\nBut you think your little apologies and sending me a link to click on is going to change your terrible service. It does nothing, means nothing and the next person who writes up is going to get the same thing.\n\nMy hire agreement:155803200\nReservation number: 1169834902\n\nGo check it out"

The hire contract was for 14 days.... after myself and my insurance company constantly trying to get them do something about it with absolute, uncaring and dismissive of any help whatsoever.... they sent a mobile KwikFit van to remove the flat tyre and fit a new tyre..... 12 days after delivering the car with faulty tyre that they must have known was faulty.

We thoroughly checked the car both times before leaving and there were no scratches at all. Funny enough the scratch only appeared 3 months later - god knows how many people used that car meanwhile. There's no point in appealing because they have 1000 clauses - so if anyone know from CS try to say \" can you please give us your reference no. etc\" - sure, nice to show that you care, but there has been months of conversations while our money was taken instantly\n\nIn summary, make sure that you return the car when there's someone there to check it with you as otherwise they will scam you"

I visited the rental office on the 11th after failing to get hold of them on the phone, returned the keys and requested that the car - which, as noted, I had been informed was not safe to drive - was collected as soon as possible.\n\nIt took them two days to do that, despite constant chasing, and in the meantime the car sat on my property, causing an inconvenience.\n\nTo add insult to injury, Europcar have now charged me for those two additional days, despite me not having access to the car (remember - they had the keys for collection).\n\nTheir customer service is the most useless I have ever dealt with.\n\nAvoid this company at all costs."

      "text": "TLDR: Mostly unimpressed!\n\nI will give them that it was relatively easy to book and pick up, however there were several things that left us very unimpressed and unlikely to use them again. First of all the van we received had a headlight out and no windscreen washer fluid. They told us to go to Halfords who sorted it but we really shouldn't have been given a vehicle with these issues, especially as we picked it up in the dark and the employee left so swiftly that we didn't have an opportunity to mention it by the time we'd realised.\n\nThe other issue was about their booking system and extra charges. Their booking system let us book the return time as 9pm without informing us that there were additional charges for returning a vehicle out of business hours, it showed us a charge for the duration of the pickup to drop off times as a set price implying that the total duration of us having the van was covered by this cost. We then received a confirmation email that very clearly said that drop off time was 9pm and when we picked up the van the employee told us it didn't matter what time we dropped it off as they were closed from 1pm. After we dropped the van back we received an email saying we would be charged extra as we dropped it off outside of business hours and when we questioned this with their customer support they just told us \"well you should have read the small print\" without addressing any of our concerns, it honestly felt like they didn't even read the email. I sent a follow up email and again they didn't address anything I mentioned just that they'd be charging us anyway. Overall customer service felt very dismissive and entirely uninterested in dealing with customer concerns or complaints.\n\nI do understand extra charges for out of hours returns however I don't think it's fair to allow these times to be selected at booking without clearly informing the customer that the extra charges are there (even allowing a specific time out of hours is odd) and even giving them the option of adding the cost on to be paid upfront (for those of us who know we'll return late). It also shouldn't have specifically included the time in the confirmation email without a warning nor should we have been told we could return the van at any time without also being told it would count as after hours. This was all very misleading. When booking the list of returns times should change based on the locations opening hours so only these times are clearly listed and then have an \"out of hours\" option that has the time range for \"out of hours\", so if the location closes at 5pm and opens at 8:30am it should say something like \"17:00-08:30 (Out of hours charges apply)\" to make it clear.\n\nThe problem here is really that they very clearly set the expectation that returning the van at 9pm was included within the price we paid which made the additional charge feel deceptive or at very least highly misleading."

I find out that Edinburgh Leith closes at 12 on a Saturday and is closed through Sunday. After phoning Europcar Leith, and then Europcar (main centre), I get to Edinburgh Airport who advise me that I should just hold onto the van and pay the extra 2 days worth of renting so I can return it on the Monday.\n\nI advise them that I am happy to drop it off at Edinburgh Airport as they are the ones who are forcing me to either pay extra for an extended rental agreement that was not originally agreed to when I paid. Edinburgh Airport say that they're happy to take the van and that I would not be charged anything for this.\n\nI receive the \"van is perfect, you'll get your full deposit back\" form back from Europcar, and then find a couple days later that they are holding onto my deposit and that I owe an additional £600 for a \"one-way surcharge\". This \"one-way surcharge\" was not in the price guarantee, and has not been communicated to me.\n\nI have been spending the past 3 weeks trying to resolve this, and have had 2 \"cases\" opened by Europcar to investigate this, but none have been closed or have given me any inkling into what actions will be done, despite being told I will hear back within 10 business days.\n\nThe company is an absolute scam, branches do not communicate to each other, and every representative is willing to blatantly lie so that they do not need to speak with you further.\n\nUPDATE: It took emailing every board member at Europcar to be escalated to the \"Executive Complaints\" teams, who supposedly looked at my case and acknowledged I was overcharged and removed the note on my credit report and all outstanding charges - and that was it. At the time, I was trying to apply for a mortgage and Europcar made this unbelievably stressful as I had a \"defaulted\" account on my credit report. Do not use. I cannot reiterate this enough."

They also don’t answer the phone in branch (again confirmed by the collection driver). Their fleet seems to comprise mainly of MG’s which is genuinely the worst car I have ever driven.

After my first courtesy car with them broke down on the M5, I was provided with a second courtesy car that also malfunctioned within their car park at the Bristol Airport branch. Despite receiving a third replacement car, it came with only a quarter tank of fuel. I was assured by the manager at the time that this would be noted in their system, yet I was later charged £110 for fuel that I never used or had to start with! Attempts to resolve this issue with their customer service and management team at the Bristol Airport branch have been fruitless, leading me to consider legal action to recover the charges. Based on this experience, I cannot recommend Europcar due to their poor service and lack of effective customer support. I would avoid using Europcar at all costs!!"

After making the booking and receive the reference number, five minutes later, a person from the Peterborough office told me there was no car available. The person was not apologetic, offer to remedy or find an alternate Europecar office that could provide a car. Their tone and manner was very unprofessional and clearly did not care.

I originally looked at the detail on easyjet website and buried in the terms and conditions it stated that i would be charged something for crossing the border but nothing about how much it would be. I got the invoices the next day and all the vat charges were incorrect. I now have been sent something that says I was charged for premium station and also got hit with extra charges on the upgrade. I have no idea whats going on. Its a complete racket and I would strongly advise anyone against using them for the their complete lack of transparency and terrible customer service. I live in Scotland and go back to Ireland at least 5 times a year. Typically the charge has been ~£30.

Even if you have a good experience most people don't post good reviews and its even more unlikely that they are full 5 stars. One could possible draw the conclusion that they are trying to counter the large number of negative reviews they are receiving.\nToday I want to share that yet another charge has been emailed to me after 2 months of returning the car. It simple says \"Customer Choice 50 Euros\" I have no idea what that even means. So today I have contacted my bank to put a stop to this and reported it as fraud.\nEuropcar if you are reading this I just wanted to let you know that this petty charging is costing you 100 times more in lost revenue. I will never use your company again. I only rent 3 or 4 times a year but no more with Europcar. Now if someone multiplies that out across all the people I will share that with and then times that by the number of negative reviews I'm sure you can see that this strategy is not a good one. Anyway, good luck trying to charge my card again. I would strongly recommend to anyone on here that you take photos and document everything. They are an untrustworthy rental company."

Luckily I took photos during pick up which showed the damage but they have still not come back to me to confirm their error. I wonder how many other unsuspecting drivers are being charged multiple times for the same damage, it seems reading this forum it is a common theme. The desk clerks are very pleasant but also very blasé when you ask them about previous damage and tell you not to worry.

A long wheel base version was supplied.\nThis vehicle has rear parking sensors, that are NOT working, only 3 out of 4 are present. I was not made aware that this feature was not working. This could have been DANGEROUS.\nI then reported this to Eurocar UK - Maidstone branch. Their response was, 'you need to call the breakdown cover'. But this is how they supplied the vehicle.?? Great attitude - maybe if they have any other vehicles requiring work, they should send them over to me to sort for them.\nTHIS IS PART OF THE CHURCHILL SUPPLY CHAIN."

      "text": "Europcar Italy (Rome) still taking money from my credit card!!! This is now 4 months since my return from Italy. A fee of £21 for notifying me by email of an alleged speeding ticket. Emailed to ask for evidence, none received, yet £21 admin fee taken form my account. I have had to contact my bank to ask them to put a freeze on subsequent amounts and to investigate into all of the complaints I have. Similarly the car hire insurance I took out through Swinton have also been informed. So far I have had an extra charge of £100 for an upgraded car I did not ask for. A potential claim of over £500 for a scratch that was already on the car when I collected it, and now this admin fee of £21. I will try to avoid them but the problem is I hired a car as an add on to flights. We often use Jet2 but they then passed the car hire on to Europcar, so in future I will either not hire a car through the airline or specifically avoid Europcar in future. Why is it so hard to get an honest trustworthy service?"

My extreme disappointment has been 3months after returning the car to be debited nearly £150, after many emails and conversations basically to be told T&Cs apply. I wasn’t shown under the car to check tyres on collection or arrival, but now been sent pictures of a nail in a tyre while up on a ramp. I’ve hired many cars, and never needed to complain. However few of my questions have been answered, just ignored. If there is damage I understand charge, but why only advise and debit 3months after the event? Anyway, I will certainly not recommend europecar to anyone and will never use them again"

I would like to state the staff in the actual office were lovely, however due to unusual traffic in London I contacted your call centre 3 times to ask about after hours drop off. The first staff member could barely speak English and told me I had to return the car to Heathrow. I asked to speak to the Victoria St Station office so I could get some info on what to do if we were late. She said she’d transfer us and hung up instead. The second person was completely unable to understand what I was asking despite having my booking in front of him. The third person was unbelievably rude. He mumbled so quietly and spoke in a bored tone. Didn’t listen to what I asked. He gave us a postcode and despite being asked to speak up three times he still muttered and mumbled so we could barely understand him. I then asked to speak directly to the Victoria St Station and he said “No. I’ve given you the information for after hours (which was incorrect) and you’ve no need to” then he hung up on me!!! All I wanted was to speak to the people at the actual office so I knew where to go. Thank goodness we arrived while they were still in the office. We banged on the window and they ignored us for awhile before finally responding. The ridiculous thing is NOWHERE on the numerous emails did your company provide ANY details about what to do if the office was closed. In this instance there was an obscure entry to a car park where we needed to go to Level 5 and then drop the keys in a box which we only found because the staff member was leaving and helped us. Clear written instructions or any one of your ‘service’ representatives just taking the time to transfer us to the Victoria Station office could have alleviated all the stress and drama. The upsetting thing is I was trying to do the right thing and get the car back despite a traffic situation beyond my control and I was treated so poorly."

Europcar still forced me to pay £40 admin fee although my PCN was waivered (not cancelled). Seems very disproportionate and based on a wording of a situation as opposed to any extra work from Europcar's side. I have raised the issue but they seem fixated on the £40 admin fee. I am a frequent user of the Europcar but this experience has led me to consider other rental companies in London. Very short sighted behavior from europcar. They are willing to lose a customer who spends hundreds of pounds each year because of a £40 admin fee. Not great business is it."

I have rented cars from numerous rental companies and never had one single issue. Rented from this lot through a 3rd party who I had taken full insurance with, so the car and full insurance for €370.\nA day after I had dropped the car back, Europcar charged me €345 for insurance with themselves which was never mentioned once by the desk agent but was put into the contract as saying I had agreed to it. Why on earth would I agree to insuring a car that’s already insured for a price that’s nearly same as my original full rental price. When the desk agent gave me the documents to read she immediately started showing me pictures on her phone of some wedding photos asking me what I thought of the quality of them etc. basically distracting me so I wouldn’t notice the additional insurance she put in the contract. She intentionally robbed me, I have no doubt about it. I have since contacted the police to get CCTV footage of the rental centre so I have evidence of the desk agent distracting me after giving me the documents, I will then be taking legal action. I would have been a returning customer as I have a few trips planned to this same place in the coming months so they have immediately lost out on 3 or 4 times the money they’re after stealing from me.

When I arrived home I was contacted by e-mail and although I protested that there was no way the damage happened while I was driving and pointed out that whoever had checked over the car before I picked it up had failed to notice the smoke smell and damage to the seat, it was made very clear that the customer's experience of the situation was of no interest to Europcar. What is even more annoying is that it took TEN WEEKS before the company finally billed me for the damage, which included £19 for \"loss of use\" (after all, it must have taken them about 15 minutes to change the tyre!), and a £40 \"administration charge\". Suffice it to say that I will NEVER use Europcar again and would recommend others to steer well clear of this company. As so often before, it annoys me intensely that it isn't possible to award ZERO stars!\nEDIT, 2/12/2023: I see that Europcar has now invited me to \"Please use this link to our customer relations team who will investigate your complaint:\". No doubt they think that this token will absolve them and create an impression that they actually act upon their customers' comments, but I refuse to let them get away with that. Anybody who cares to take a look will immediately notice that this is their standard cut-and-paste response to any negative reviews. In view of the total lack of understanding and respect for the customer's views that has been displayed in several e-mail responses so far, I fail to see how there can be any point in contacting the customer relations team. I know that will only lead to more frustration and wasted time spent communicating with people who refuse to even consider the merits of the customer's arguments and it will not change the outcome one iota."

The staff in Bristol South branch are helpful all the time.\nI cannot say the same thing about the customer service.\nUsually when I rent a vehicle I am using a credit card for the deposit while paying the charges with a debit card and i never had problems. The last time I had the very unpleasant surprise for the deposit to be actually taken from the credit card and used as part of the payment even though all the charges were already paid with my debit card. This caused a problem for me as by actually debiting my credit card cause it to go over the limit and incur additional charges.\nI called the customer service and all they did was hiding behind the contract and telling me that my deposit will be returned in my debit card in 10 days time. So, not only they took my money causing me additional charges, I had to block more money to bring the credit card within its limit and now I have to wait 10 days for the amount which should have never been taken to be returned to me.\nI'm absolutely disgusted and disappointed with the experience with the customer service and the complaints team.\nWhen I emailed that I want compensation for the trouble they caused they replied that will be no compensation as they can take the money from whichever card they want. But the charges have been prepaid at the beginning of the rental period, people!!!!!"

I wonder what is the business of these companies, because renting cars to customers I don't think so. I will not repeat with them again.\n\nIn august I was traveling in England and had the bad idea to rent a car with europcar uk. I still don't know how but I didn't pay a highway toll, I didn't even know that I had to pay. The thing is that once in germany, the traffic department in uk claims me 5 pounds plus penalty for delay and on the other hand europcar uk wants to charge me 40 pounds for the administration, what administration if I have paid it all from germany.\nThe job of europcar uk should have been to pay immediately the 5 pounds claimed to your car registration number and at maximum then charge those 5 pounds to the customer, who had already paid a huge amount for the car rented with full insurance.\nEuropcar in Germany maybe, in England never again.\n\nUpdate: 01.12.2023\nthe link with email is useless or unusable.\nThey are really interested in solving the problems of their customers, so here is the reference of my case:\n\nInformation Regarding your Vehicle Rental 155248867 [419241/4782] - Case #18242466 - Case #18279452\n\nif they really solve them (I get my £40 back) I will update my review.\nBest regards"

As such they would issue me a refund for the delivery amount. I then received an amended booking form with £96 as the total paid. When I went to collect my van I queried the £126 on the pick up paperwork and mentioned the amended amount. She told me she doesn't deal with that element of rentals and to email in. I did so on the 28th asking for my refund of £30 and almost instantly received a bank notification that a further £18 was due to be taken from my account. I emailed a follow up email and got a response 'confirming I was charged for collection' and an £18 refund has been processed. I immediately responded asking for you to honor the £96 I was notified the booking had been changed to and refund the difference charged, and have heard nothing since. \n\nIt's now the 30th November and I've had a total of £144 taken out of my account for a van booking I was told at time of amendment would be £96. \n\nI previously booked with this company 2 months ago so I know that you pay for both delivery and collection separately. Nb that time I also received a random erroneous charge to my account of £5 which when I queried it they said had been done in error due to the price of the rental increasing after I booked. Seems this is their way of sneaking a bit of extra cash out of customers in such small amounts they hope it hasn't been noticed. AVOID LANCEFIELD QUAY GLASGOW"

We immediately called Europcar assistence that after 2 hours send us the road assistance. The guy didn't have the proper tyre and said us that the plug was not enough because the hole was on the side of the tyre and he also said that it would be illegal, so he called tyre assistence to replace the tyre. We paid 180 pounds and we asked that it be refund because we paied for the full cover for our rental. Europcar said us we should not have to pay and so far we didn't receive answer or refund, but what we had to do? Spend the night at 60 miles from our hotel when the next morning we had the flight back to home?? There was no option!\nI cannot accept that because I arranged the full cover insurance with Europcar and I have paid the maximum possible amount to Europcar. I have rent car from them many times, but that was the last time for sure!\n\nUPDATE\nEuropecar declined my request for the tyre repair to be reimbursed. They say I should have called the Europcar assistence and it was exactly what I did! The Europcar assistance arrive 2hours later and they didn't have the proper tyre, and he also said it should be illegal to drive so what was I supposed to do? Spend the night in the car and wait there till Monday (it was Saturday late afternoon) because its assistance didn't have the proper tyre since Monday as they said?? A flat tyre happens quite frequently and it is unapcettable that Europcar assistance doesn't have the proper tyre so, not to spend the whole night waiting in the car (and even more, from Saturday afternoon to Monday morning, the time necessary to Europcar to have a proper new tyre!), I had to call a private aasistance as suggest by Europcar assistence itself! I can absolutely say that Europcar is a scam, the most expensive rental company with a totally bad customer service and a very low level assistance on the road even for the most basic things. Avoid it!"

I had to pay almost 750 GBP in all when I went to pick up the car. They take signatures everywhere and don't provide all the information accurately. Even after that, Eurocar levies an additional 40 GBP for simply forwarding emails as an administration fee for each and every PCN or other penalties you get. For example, If you got two PCN you have to pay PCN charge plus 40+40=80 GBP to Europcar as an administration fee. Don't trust them, so please be alert before renting and make sure you know the full total before you arrive."

The cost of this additional insurance exceeded $1000. My wife, managing two very young children at the time, was unfairly pressured into this purchase. Regrettably, I was not accompanying them on this trip. I immediately contacted the company's customer service to address this issue but to no avail.

      "text": "Very rude, impolite and unhelpful person on the desk at Chelmsford. Refused my car hire despite me contacting customer services who told me the credit check had passed. I’m a nurse and needed transport - this man was unpleasant to the point of being obstructive. Would suggest some training for him or perhaps apply for another job if he doesn’t want to be there. This was today at approximately midday. When giving him the answers from central customer services he said “I’m not giving you the car” and kept saying “you can look at the computer if you want” - he flatly refused to contact the customer services office and I was left without transport, having to take more time off work and about £148 out of pocket. Poor procedure and a very poor experience. Wouldn’t ever entertain using Europcar and will be telling friends and family to do the same. Never had any issue hiring a car before and this was an awful experience I won’t be repeating! If you want a smooth hire experience (as I’ve had several times before) don’t go to Europcar - or certainly don’t go to Chelmsford!"

Charged me for 8 days instead of 7 because there was an hours difference in picking it up and dropping it off and to top it all, helped themselves to over £200 out of my account 3 days AFTER I returned the car. Was told the team will get back to me within 7 days to resolve the “dispute”?? There is no dispute and this will be going further. Had nothing but trouble with this joke of a company from start to finish"

(I did this because having previously hired at the Manchester Trafford Park depot I have witnessed other other customers in similar disputes that have advised on always filming a video - so I do)\n\nAgent then assured that this would all be added to the report and I had nothing to worry about. A day after returning the vehicle I received a damage notice and Europcar have raised an insurance claim.\nI took the matter to customer service who asked me to send a screenshot shot of the video. They then replied a day later asking for further evidence so I send the video with both myself and their agent pre inspecting the vehicle.\nAs a previously regular customer I hadn’t had any issues and thought this would be quickly resolved. As such I booked another vehicle two days later… upon collecting it was the EXACT SAME VEHICLE. And still had unrecorded damage again I record a video and write down everything myself rather the than trust the agent to do so.\nI return the vehicle and it’s the same agent from the first hire, I show him the video of himself, he assures me that he will take this to his manager\nI have since sent two further emails asking for an update, during which time random figures have been withdrawn from my bank accounts - Despite sending the video I am still yet to receive a reply."

On the first day of hire the oil warning lamp lit up. I had to pull in to a service station & check the oil level (which was barely visible on the dipstick). After filling a litre of motor oil the warning lamp went out.\nLuckily I didn't have to travel more than 300 miles locally with the car, I certainly wouldn't have trusted this \"old banger\" on a longer motorway journey.\nI intended to take the matter up with the staff at Newcastle airport on return at 8:15 on the 13th of Nov. But the Europcar field station was empty & locked in spite of it supposedly being manned from 8 am. So I had to put the keys in their Dropbox & I complained to customer service once I got home.\nI received a superficial apology & an offer of 5% off my next rental. But I won't be hiring from Europcar again & I would advise others to check their Europcar hire very carefully before accepting it.\nI have used Europcar at NCL airport many times over the years. But I have never hired a car with such high mileage on the clock, or so obviously poorly maintained & scruffy. It'll be Avis or Hertz next time.\nWell done Europcar!"

Spent 2 days, 39 phone calls to branch (Ipswich), average wait time 15 minutes followed by prerecorded message of no one can answer or in an occasion answering and immediate hanging up so they could make a call out! 4 calls to customer service to arrange collection, expressed concern and response of customer service team was there was nothing they could do and were not worried about being unable to contact the branch! Poor experience start to finish, definitely go to another provider if you need a hire car.\n\nUpdated following Eurpocar response, I spoke to customer service 4 times, they could not contact the branch and offered no resolution. Again great and responding to public criticism but actually don’t do a thing about it! Europcar continue to display the same level of apathy.

The second time, they gave me a van with a broken door handle and a sensor that kept beeping about the door being open the entire time i had it, the worst car hire anxiety filled experience I've ever had. I raised the issue during the rental but was ignored, i called during the rental but also was directed to the wrong dept twice. I tried to complain after the rental, but they dismissed me and ignored my emails. They don’t care about their customers or their safety.

So then stranded at hotel for the night and ultimately until 11am next day when my partner had to go with broken car being towed back to branch to get swapped. No apologies from company. Told I would get full refund when I finally got through on the phone around 10am to branch (lots of attempted calls later and wrong transfers) (I requested this refund as completely ruined our plans for 2 out of 3 days) told she just had to get advice on how this would work as we booked through booking.com. When partner arrived to switch cars told no. Branch can’t do refunds will have to open complaint via phone/email. When I emailed my complaint I got a very quick reply saying they’d refund one day. Even though they had completely ruined our trip and were beyond unhelpful on trying to find solutions.\nWe paid way over the odds for a car we got barely any use out of and spent from 3pm Sunday until 10am Monday spending all our trip frantically trying to get ahold of ANYONE from this company. they are saying their ‘investigation’ is closed and we won’t be getting the full money back. They also take £100 deposit for petrol that your suppose to automatically get back. Still not seen this money.\nNever had such a bad and stress inducing experience with a company for them to honesty not care less makes it so much worse.\nPlease avoid and use other companies, there’s plenty offering the same thing with MUCH better service."

When you read through the reviews here, it comes up many, many times.\n\nUnfortunately, I now know why.\n\nI have used Europcar around the world for decades, and if this branch is an indication of what the company has become, then I would advise everyone to stay away!\n\nI prebooked a Ford Focus 10 days for 434.40 gbp - pretty normal.\nI went to collect my reservation at Heathrow after 65 hours of travel, pre booked and price set at 434.40 gbp.\n\nAt the counter, the agent said \"free upgrade to an automatic Mercedes\".\n\nShe then took credit card Authorisation, and only when I spotted the amount on the eftpos terminal, did I spot that I had been charged 1398.40 gbp, so an unauthorised jump of 964 GBP.\n\nImmediately raised the issue, the staff acknowledged the incorrect amount, but they refused to reverse the credit card authorisation. They then said they would draw up a new contract at the original quoted amount.\n\nThey flat refused to give me a copy of the original invoice.\n\nThey said they could not refund the credit card, it would take at least 14 days - So if I took the original (3 times quoted amount) they could reverse it, otherwise not possible.\n\nThis is becoming obvious at this point that it is some form of \"commission scam\".\n\nSo now I have 2 pending amounts against my visa, obviously affecting the total limit of the card.\n\nNext, I went to pick up the vehicle, I am given a Vauxhall Crossland (I requested a Ford Focus), and the state the vehicle is in, is disgusting, and this shouldn't be given to any customers. If this is the state of your fleet, you should retire them.\n\nThe vehicle has been used by a heavy smoker, the car reeks of smoke, and there is cigarette burns on the driver’s seat.\n\nThe outside of the vehicle has damage on every panel and the wheels. It looks like it has been through some form of war.\n\nI have a full video of the state of the vehicle before collection.\n\nSo I drive out of the lot with my poor looking Crossland, get on the freeway to head a couple of hours down to Southampton. Hot day, AC on, and AC doesn’t work!\n\nCalled customer help line, get nowhere. I then head up to Milton Keynes and go to the Europcar depot there. The counter manager was helpful, test drives the car & confirms AC does not function at all. This is Thursday. They do not have a replacement car, so they promise to call me the next day for a swap over.\n\nNo call. Go to the depot on Saturday & its closed.\n\nCall customer helpline. they confirmed Milton Keynes is closed (yep, sitting outside it).\n\nTheir suggestion was to head to Luton Airport (I was now at Silverstone) a round trip of 4 hours (remember no aircon, and hottest September in 30 years).\n\nI had to pay for the extra mileage & fuel of course.\n\nI arrived at Luton, Staff were good, Friendly. They then gave me an Vauxhall CORSA. A little beat up, but better than the last OPEL. I headed off out of the compound to have the oil light & check engine lights both start flashing. Tried the Air conditioning & completely non functional. (Don't know if air conditioning failure is standard on these Vauxhall's).\n\nBack to the depot (another 20 mile loop). The lot operator was super helpful, and we checked the oil, not even showing on the dipstick. Then we checked the front tyres, Both completely bald, the LH one showing canvas.\n\nHe was embarrassed (felt sorry for him) he took us inside to the manager, and took a while, but they found a SEAT CUPRA manual. It was tidy, and everything worked!\n\nRest of the trip went as it should have.\n\n3 weeks to have my original amount (1398.40gbp) refunded.\n\nDo not trust or use Europcar Heathrow."

I refused to pay the approx. £300 they were demanding and told them it was a con. Anything could have happened in that 6 week period.\nSo everything goes quiet only to receive a demand and the threat of legal action from solicitors (Sue, Grabbit and Runne) if I didn’t pay up plus a late payment demand of £40. This was received 09 November 23. Total £330. Due to the stress it was causing my wife, she paid up.\nI beg anyone not to hire through Europcar. They stink. My practical advice is to take pictures of the front, sides and back before you accept the car and do the same when you off hire; and, make them sign off.\nThis has been going on for almost a year. I took their word on trust and got stung. They are a crooked organisation. Caveat Emptor."

Car didn't show up, so called them and after several frustrating hours of phone calls they denied the delivery date stating the car was booked i for the 15th december. to be fair i was fairly rude to the initial person who booked the car and i think she changed the date just to annoy me. I'd say they're the worst company I have ever dealt with, but that prize is already taken by aviva!!"

Only to find that the member of staff at the airport had delayed booking the vehicle in to 3 minutes before our check in.\nUnfortunately, no form of proof could be provide and the full £200.00 deposit has been withheld for payment of an extra day's hire. The previous 4 day hire only cost £163.00 ??, so beware get proof to save you from been ripped off.\nThanks for getting in touch europcar, but you haven't investigated this just stuck with false time and still charged me 200 pound for it.\nWill never use your services again!"

I explained that if the vehicle was to breakdown on the main road. i would be leaving the car there and going home for them to recover because i'm completely fed up of chasing everyone for an update.

      "text": "This review is a warning not to fall for scare tactics when it comes to their premium cover. If you still feel you need additional cover than what they offer as standard shop about. There are dozens of places that offer more comprehensive cover and for a fraction of the cost. £220 for a week is scandalous and its pure profit for them. You can get better elsewhere for about £40 for the week. No wonder they are so keen to offer it. The finacial incetives for the sales person and the fact that they are probably targeted means they have to be pushy with it. My partner however fell for this. She needed a hire car as ours was having some work done and she needed to get home to say her goodbyes to her dying Grandmother. She booked the car online and went to pick it up. She'd read through the cover options and selected the one she required which was the standard one. That didn't stop the person behind the counter laying on the spiel about how much it will cost her if anything were to happen. They were aware of her predicament before hand and also knew she had to make haste but that doesn't stop them. Laying it on thick for someone who already had enough to worry about. In hidsight she knew she should have cancelled when she got down the road and realised that she'd been fleeced but as I said, she had other things on her mind. It's pushy sales tactics that pray and people insecurities to flog an overpriced product. Thankfully there are other more affordable options available elsewhere otherwise I'd suggest this con by the hirecare companies should be looked in to. I did make a complaint about how it was sold to an already vulnerable person but it fell on deaf ears. They're not that interested. She'd signed a contract and that was that. Very little contrition on there part knowing full well how they operate and how much they charge, knowing full well their options are a million miles from being competitive.\n\nJusy say no and shop about if you feel you need it.\n\nI await the stock response saying how sorry they are and that they will look in to it. Just empty words.\nComplaint case number is 18052138"

Interesting as the return document says 8/8 on fuel and everything else ok.\n\nThey are 'investigating'.\n\nI wonder how many people this happens to who don't notice?\n\nEDITED 2 hrs after initial review to downgrade to one star.\n\nSo, instead of refunding the missing deposit they decided to debit be another £147.58. This was the actual hire cost.\n\nThey'll give it back within 10 days. They say.\n\nIt's a shame there's no option for ZERO stars."

      "text": "At around 17.45 on 01/11/2023 I had a car delivered from Europcar as a courtesy car for Motability whilst my own car is off the road & in the garage, I didn't use the car until the following morning. But when I started the engine a tyre pressure warning light came on, I called Europcar to report this along with a couple of other things that weren't on their damage list given to me at handover. But all they said was that I had to report it via their damage email. After this call I went out in the vehicle, only to find it drove really heavy & that I had to push the accelerator almost fully down to get any sort of power when crossing a roundabout.\nMy daughter-in-law drove it on 04/11/2023 & said that it was horrible to drive (she has driven an identical car to this, as her mum had one & that one did not drive like this one) & even you paid her she wouldn't get behind the wheel of that car again. I have been sent from one person to another, been told different things by different people, been spoken abruptly to, (was even told that because my name is spelt wrong on the rental agreement that my insurance wouldn't be valid, it is) so much so that I ended up contacting Motability, bursting into tears on the phone & getting them to try to sort things.\nDue to this software/electrical issues with my own car I became afraid to drive it incase it went wrong whilst I was using it, hence my getting a courtesy vehicle from Europcar, but can honestly say that I felt safer driving my own car than this hire car. I have been placed on a list for a replacement vehicle, but not given any eta on this happening, even though I told them that I need a safe working car due to a couple of personal things.\nThis company despite having a contract with Motability to supply courtesy vehicles to those on the Motability scheme when their own vehicle breaks down & is in the garage, meaning they should keep so many aside for this purpose, but do NOT. Yet, they don't give motability customers the same customer service that they give cash paying customers (those that hire a vehicle through the normal channels, via walk in, website or phone) They treat Motability customers like second class citizens, this car is a prime example of that as it should never have been sent out with any warning lights lit up on the dashboard yet it was sent out to me, something that would not have happened had I been a paying customer. If I were a paying customer I would avoid this hire company like the plague & will NEVER recommend it to anyone.\n\nUpdate:\n\nOn 06/11/2023, I wrote the above review, which Europcar replied to (see below) asking me to contact them on the website in said reply. However, is you go to this sight & click on the email icon, it gives you 3 options, the 2nd applies to me as it is an issue during rental, then it gives you another list of options, none of which applies to me, meaning I can't use this option to contact them as they request in order for them to resolve my issues. Again, if I didn't have a Motability car currently in the garage you couldn't pay me to use Europcar. If I could give them 0 stars then believe me I would 100% do that, I will also tell anyone thinking of using them to run in the opposite direction & find a different hire company to use. These in my honest opinion are one of the worst vehicle hire companies around"

      "text": "Rented a car from Heathrow. I wanted an SUV for three weeks - hoped for Nissan Qashqai, but got a Vauxhall, which is the worst car I have ever driven in my life. If it had been mine, I would have taken it to the garage for service. By the time I got home from Heathrow, I noticed that the front offside tyre was going down very slowly. I phoned your customer service to let them know. After 3 attempts, I got someone who knew what they were talking about and she booked me in to Kwikfit, the company you have chosen to use for tyres. Kwikfit then contacted me to say they couldn't see me, so I contact customer service, and after going round in circles 5 times, they gave me another Kwikfit branch to go to. I took the car there and they said that even although the tyre was low pressure, they couldn't find a puncture. They tested all the tyres and said that in their opinion, the tyres were not tested before hire - all tyres were at wildly different pressures. Last Saturday, I visited my daughter, 50 miles away from me. The tyre had gone down. So, I phoned customer service again because I was no longer going to drive this unsafe vehicle. I learned that one should not have a puncture on a weekend. Local Kwikfit branches were closed, so I was told that I would be recovered to Heathrow (75 miles away), which I declined, as I told your company, I was disabled and could not do that. I was promised a callback and none was received. I then spoke to your breakdown line and the AA came out. It was dark with heavy rain, but the man found the puncture, which Kwikfit couldn't find, and made a temporary repair. I am here on holiday from Los Angeles, and Europcar's lack of assistance in this matter has wrecked my stay in the UK. I lost 4 days of my holiday chasing you. It would seem therefore, that I was rented an unsafe vehicle and when I tried to rectified this, Europcar went out of their way to be unhelpful."

Whenever I tried to book, the page wouldn't load so resulted to calling customer service.\nOn the phone, the person said they can't deliver the vehicle for me so I have to pick it up, but they can certainly come to collect from a different location. I was then quoted £241.64. I told the person the phone that online ita a completely different price. He said I was wrong or the website is wrong. I tried to explain that this is slightly misleading, but the person on the phone very much ignored me. Okay, whatever, went ahead and paid after confirming I will collect the car from Chester and it would be picked up in Mold. The confirmation email says Chester to Chester which I can't do! Called today to amend the booking to a shorter period only to be told its not possible because I prepaid. I will have to cancel the whole thing and re-book which would include additional charges. What?! Had I been told when booking in the first place its not amendable, I would've just done it online, but apparently not because the website is wrong anyway and wouldnt work. So now, I have a booking which is has been overcharged, wrong and uncancellable without incurring further charges."

Obviously I was not told about this failure beforehand. I was then redirected to Eurocar Portugal which took another 3 weeks before a response was made regarding payment. Luckily yes they agreed to pay for all admin fees, I asked couldn't they jusy pay the full thing due to the inconvenience and not my fault at all it was not paid. Obviously they said no.\nFurthermore, they will pay me in Euro although I paid in GBP this bill therefore I am recieving less than what I paid the fine for and will get an FX charge from my card.\nStill awaiting payment so will see how long that will take, if it ever arrives.\nI will never go through Eurocar again, gave me so much administration work and time fighting this.

My insurance arranged everything. The car was delivered to my house and we went through all the procedures. But before using the car, I had took all the precautions, I took all the photos of scratches, alloy, fuel gauge and mileage just to cover my back.\n\nI recieved this car on the 5th of September 2023 and my car was fixed and returned in the morning on the 8th of September. Anyway I informed them straight away to come and collect their car but never did until the 15th of September, which wasnt an issue to me as the Car was parked securely at home.\n\nOn the 15th someone came to collect the car, he just came and took the car without doing all the procedure and I asked him why he wasnt checking and he said he was just asked to collect the car. After a day I recieved a letter saying I had not filled back the fuel which I did and had receipts and photos of the fuel gauge of the before and after. After all the explanation they said it was in error and didnt need to pay anything.\n\nTo my surprise, on the 26th of October 2023 after over a month they send me a letter saying I had damaged the alloy wheels. What a joke! It took them over a month to check the car but they had checked the fuel guage the following day after collection and wanted to RIP me off and failed and now they sending me false damages after over a month of having the car. The car shouldn't have been driven from my house without doing proper procedures the same procedure you did when you dropped it. Whoever collected the car could have done those damages you're are claiming was me. Why collecting a car without making sure all procedures are followed.\n\nI'm glad I covered my back by taking before and after photos of everything and im happy to be going to Court if I have to as I have all the evidence I need. I would not be paying a penny to this SHAM of a company. They have definitely destroyed thier own reputation by ripping off people left and right.\n\nI wonder how they sleep at night...ain't we all struggling!"

One of the car was not getting enough power on 1st gear, other car's AC was not working. My friend struggled a lot in the hilly area and we sweated so much in the car. We had to keep our window open on the motorway and you can understand, how difficult that was. We wanted to change the car, but they would not do it, as they did not have any car available. We parked our car in a hotel and paid for both the cars. Unfortunately, one of the car's payment did not go through, as it was paid on a card which is not from UK. I got a ticket and I appealed to the company. They understood my intention and asked me to pay £25 only, when the ticket price was £28. So, the parking company's fine was £100 but £50 if paid in 14 days. But, Europcar has already taken the money, eventhough I have mailed them, that I have appealed against the ticket, please wait till I get a decission. I have sent Europcar all my appeal letter and reply from the parkmaven. Now, they are saying, they can only refund if the parking company does not charge any money from me. There ticket was £28, they asked me to pay £25; which is they have not fined me at all just took the ticket price, which was my intention to pay. But Europcar just wants money and took £40 admin fees for a £25 ticket.\nWe later regreted renting from Europcar, our private car would have been lot better than the cheap and faulty car they rents out to people."

      "text": "Very poor customer service, staff were not at all helpful or friendly. Vehicle was damaged and not recorded on collection form which delayed me. The vehicle was not fully cleaned. The wipers did not work correctly and should have been checked before hiring which was dangerous. Staff were uninterested. I filled the vehicle with fuel before returning and unhelpful staff said it was not full I had to return to fuel station and try and get more fuel in which was not possible apart from 1.5 litres went back and staff said it was still not full. When I worked out the mileage I had done against the fuel used the van only done 24.17 miles to the gallon, this seems somewhat dubious. I would recommend using another hire company that value their customer and not try to make an extra few quid on the hire charge. AVOID"

      "text": "Do not use Europcar UK\n\nI had made an online booking from home allowing me the time to consider which car, insurance etc. suited me best. I choose a MG at a cost of GBP 318.\n\nArriving at the counter at Manchester the show began. Everything in my online booking was questioned, which is exactly what I want to avoid making an online booking, i.e. risking saying yes to something that is not fully transparent. What is the point then of making a online booking?\n\nI was asked whether I wanted a manual or automatic. I was not informed about any price difference and in my naivity thought it was because they had excess automatics. At no point in time was I informed that it came with an additional cost.\n\nI was asked about navigation. I said no thanks and I do not know whether I have paid for it. I cannot see it from the very little informative invoice.\n\nI was asked about insurance. I said 3 or 4 times that I wanted the insurance packaged I had ticked of in the online booking. It turned out I got a much more expensive solution. Again I was not informed about the difference in cost.\n\nI was offered a VW passat instead of the MG booked online. Luckily I said no, despite the fact that I was asked if I was sure 4-5 times. I bet that also came with an additional cost that I was not informed about.\n\nI was not taken through the rental agreement, but was only shown were to sign, which I did in my naivity. I just received the invoice, GBP 776, more than twice the preferred solution in my online booking.\n\nNo wonder that we were only two persons at the Europcar counter whilst the Avis counter had 10-15 people queuing. I guess it is back to Avis.\n\nTaking a look at the review of the various Europcar entities here on trustpilot, Europcar UK stands out as the worst scoring Europcar entity. My experience is completely in line and follow the same pattern as all the other unsatisfied customers reviews in here. Complete lack of customer care.\n\nI have filed a complaint to Europcar UK, but got a fairly standard answer. Of course they rejected to pay back anything.\n\nUpdate 6 November: No response using the link. after two complaints via mail both with negative response, I have been directed towards BVRLA!!"

I was over charged 322 pounds, and customer services upheld the payment after I explained that I had specifically stated I only wanted the basic deal.\nRecord your conversation at the time you collect your car and paperwork.\nThey need to look into their staff who miss sell extra insurance and premium deals.\nI have been totally ripped off, I would never recommend this company."

Stranded waiting for RAC. 5 hrs so far. No help at all from useless customer lack of service. Furthermore the windscreen wipers are beyond shot and must have been like this for months to be this bad. DO NOT FEEL SAFE AT ALL. No more rentals with this company EVER"

      "text": "My father who is a disabled pensioner waited all day Friday for a car to be delivered and it didn't show. He then got a message to say it would be delivered before 1pm on Saturday, again, it didn't show. He then got a message to say it would arrive no later that 1pm on Monday. It still didn't show. Both my father and I have been trying to get through to the Hamilton branch for three days, we are kept on hold for half-an-hour then the phone line goes dead. This is a really unforgivable way to treat an old man who can't walk. I just spoke to the head office and they explained that the car wasn't released because a \"£1 fuel deposit wasn't paid\". This is the first time we have heard anything about this, and, if this was the case, why were we told three times that the car was on it's way? Also, why don't you answer your phone line?"

      "text": "Booked a van. They cancelled it 15 days later, leaving me with 4 days to arrange a replacement. Phoned them, booked a replacement with the agent over the phone. They cancelled that one the next day, leaving me scrabbling to arrange a van hire for an extra £104 the day before the rental. Website still showed the vehicle as available! Told me that the site only catered for commercial customers, but the website and agent both allowed me to book there so I think that was a lie. Didn't offer any alternative vehicle or site. Refused any compensation for the extra £104 let alone the extra hassle. Website and phone centre are both dreadful and any vehicle they may have is presumably entirely coincidental. Avoid, avoid, avoid.\n\nUpdate: after this review they looked at the complaint again. Came back and offered me 15% off a future rental. I'm still £104 out of pocket and have no way of telling whether they'd ever actually have a vehicle for a new rental anyway because the website and the contact centre are both unreliable. And it excludes vans, which is what I was hiring."
