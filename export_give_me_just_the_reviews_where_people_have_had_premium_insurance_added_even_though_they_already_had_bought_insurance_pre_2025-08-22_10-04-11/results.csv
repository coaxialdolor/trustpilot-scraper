Seems to be a theme about mis selling insurance. I am currently ""in conversation"" with customer services about added extras I never ordered and I am looking for a refund. I never requested roadside assistance or personal protection but these were added to invoice. This is a scam where they make these additions part of your deposit. It is basically theft.

Customer services have now told me that cannot do anything as they were not part of verbal conservation at location - they have said that I should have been offered extras and asked to accept or decline which never happened.

So basically buyer should be aware of this practice and scrutinise what you are signing up for and make sure no extras have been added surreptitiously

I would also beware of premium location surcharge that is added to costs.
I certainly will not hire from them again.",0.49925685

Booked in advance but because they wouldnt accept different cards we had we were forced to take out their insurance for the week which was more than the cost of the car hire. We had arranged our own insurance at a tenth of the price but they would not even look at the paperwork. It was late with only a few other companies open and limited availability. When I asked why the insurance was so high they said it was a local insurance company. Never given a policy document just €268 item on the bill. We still had to pay a deposit.

Olivia Hearn,2025-06-30,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/68625274c5215784a6d3e650,"I rented a car from Europcar Gatwick in February 2025. When making the booking I added full insurance through the booking agent Discover cars and the supplier being keddy (AKA Europcar).
At the desk the lady verbally said she could see I had insurance so all was good, I paid the deposit.
It wasn’t until I looked at the invoice at home and saw a charge for premium insurance which had been added on top of the full cover insurance I had already purchased online. The premium insurance added was for £274. I immediately phoned Europcar, they told me they couldn’t do anything til after the car had been returned. So I emailed them once I had returned the car and keys to the out of office box.
This was in February. I have formally complained 3? times now. And nothing. I left a review on Google and Europcar just sent me the link to complain, the same link I’ve used several times already with no response.
I’ve seen lots of other Google reviews where people have been in the same situation as me. They just seem like an absolute scam of a company. And then actually ignore you when you try and pull them up on it. AVOID EUROPCAR.",0.49244368

I hope that others read the reviews before booking with Europcar Gatwick. I have rented cars for over 45 years and have NEVER been scammed like this.

On arrival the woman at the desk tried to make me upgrade the car - making it appear that that was the one l been allocated (she already had the key on the desk infront of her). I refused and said l wanted the car l had booked.

Next, premium insurance was added to my contract without asking me. As a result, l paid 150% more on my originally booking price. I have annual excess insurance and never use the rental company insurance went l rent.

They hid the fact that insurance was added by including it in the credit card excess authisation. Therefore, you are unaware that you have purchased insurance until your card is charged after the rental. Look at the reviews, many others have been scammed in this way.

When I asked if the car had any damaged, l was told that it wasn't necessary to check it. On return, it was a different story, with the attendant checking the car minutely - going around it several times. In the end he found a very small scratch and l was required to sign off on the damage. I cannot say if the damage was already done when l rented the car. The scratch was so small l do not believe l would have noticed it ... and certainly not in poor light conditions.

If you use this company you should make sure that you photograph the whole car, including wheels, before you drive off.

Got cheap car rental through Booking.com for Europcar. Even paid an additional amount on the booking for full insurance for a 7 day hire.

Arrived at Fuerteventura airport and was told that the full insurance wasn’t any good as it was taken through a third party. They sold me the full insurance for €285 on top of what I had already paid!!!!! This ensured that any damage would be waived.

Picked up the car and noticed a few marks on it - I wasnt bothered as I had full cover.

Returned the car after 7 days, and with no damage to it. They scoured the car and told me I’d damaged the rear of the car (I hadn’t). Luckily I’d taken out their rip off insurance, so I could walk away worry free.

Gerson Duarte,2025-01-04,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/67798e3f2ad12d49c6bbe1fe,"On Friday the 20th December of 2024 I booked a rental vehicle through the Easyjet website, collecting it from Europcar Manchester Airport at 3:00pm.

From the innumerous companies based in Manchester, I chose Europcar as it is a well-reputed company in the market, trustworthy and with relatively affordable prices.
According to the booking summary I did not contract any other services or extra options in addition to the car rental.

When collecting the vehicle the employee present at the time suggested me to upgrade my cover to a premium insurance, to which I said I was not interested.

Upon my answer, your employee gave me several documents to sign under the excuse they were mandatory to the conclusion of the rental contract.

The car was returned with a full tank, without any faults or damage, something that was checked by your staff at the time of delivery.

I was completely gobsmacked and furious when I received the invoice where you Europcar charged me almost double the amount that had been previously agreed.

I will bring again to your attention that I did not contract or subscribed to any extra services, neither at the time of booking nor at the time of collection.

After reading SEVERAL feedbacks from other dissatisfied customers on several internet pages, I can finally understand where the issue relies:
Because I refused the premium insurance, the employee took advantage of my apparent rush to collect the car keys and the fact that I was a foreigner and non English native, to give me the premium insurance contract to sign mixed up with other paperwork.

This is fraud, and you are accountable for it.

Unfortunately this situation, which is very difficult to prove, seems to be recurring and many customers were scammed in this way (you can find plenty similar cases here in Google Feedback, for example).

That said, my only question is:
Are your employees who, in search of commission money, deceive Europcar customers?
Or is Europcar the one encouraging employees to carry out this type of fraudulent scheme?
Until what extend are you as a company involved in this fraudulent scheme?

Either options are despicable and reprehensible.
Considering Europcar has been operating since 1949 and has a reputation to uphold, you should be ashamed of your employees actions and take responsibility for their misdeeds.

I expect nothing than a full refund covering the extra money that was abusively withdrawn from my account, and for the employees who have been carrying such fraud to be sanctioned and brought to justice.

I expect an answer from you within the next 15 days, and in the case of failure I will seek further action with legal authorities.
I will also report this matter to the GOV.UK, Trading Standards Institute and to the ECRCS.

You can fool me once, but you won't fool twice. As someone who travels to England twice a year, I will never use your services again, and I will make sure this situation is widely spread.",0.4024796

I rented a car at London Gatwick Airport after booking the car and purchasing a ""Premium"" insurance policy online with e-Dreams. At the airport counter, the agent informed me that since I already had insurance with full coverage, I did not need to subscribe to any additional insurance. I was also told that a deposit of 700 euros would be charged (something I was already aware of through the contract signed with e-Dreams). In good faith, I signed the required forms on the tablet (the amount indicated was £647, which I believed to be the deposit) and was given a document with the rental and payment details; nothing else was handed to me, nor sent via email (certainly not an insurance policy that might have raised some suspicions).
After two months of waiting for the refund of what I thought was the deposit, I was informed, upon my inquiry, that no refund would be issued as the amount charged corresponded to the cost of the insurance I had supposedly subscribed to. Realizing I had signed a document without verifying that the amount (which was not specified) actually consisted of £100 for the deposit and £546 for the insurance policy (this was the final amount charged), I nonetheless filed a complaint with customer service. Their prompt response (only 21 minutes after my email!) stated that since it was impossible to verify what had been discussed verbally, only the signed document held any validity!

What did we rent?
My mom and I rented a Fiat 500 via a trusted German website costing us exactly EUR 175. Insurance and everything is covered by the broker. We just wanted to pick up our rental.

What happened?
At the Europcar counter we were greeted by Euan (or Ewan). He seemed like one chirpy Scotsman. To our delight he upgraded us ""free of charge"". What an amazing guy! We couldn't believe our luck. He said, ""you definitely need something bigger where you are headed and I have just the car"".

There was no mention of additional costs whatsoever.
Who wouldn't like a free upgrade when they're headed into the Scottish outback?

Some papers were elegantly shuffled around, we were told to sign here, here and here. After that we had to pop our card into the machine for the deposit and it was a done deal. Only it wasn't.

The trickery and the damage.
The upgrade was not free of charge and the additional cost of the rental was £171.86 or EUR 205. EXTRA! That's more than the initial rental booking. Both numbers look extremely similar by the way. When we inserted our card for the deposit, we in fact paid for the upgrade. That was NEVER mentioned to us. We also never paid for a deposit, which is utterly bizarre. The kicker is that we didn't receive an end of rental statement either. Also, the charge for the upgrade was not taken out until 2 weeks after the rental (06/11/24). So even if we had paid with Monzo, which shows charges instantly we would not have realised it then and there at the counter.

Of course we signed the papers and that's enough for Europcar. Why would they care? Their golden boy Euan is ripping off people by the planeloads making the rental car company a F-ton of extra money. Unfortunately our broker nor our bank couldn't help, but that's not the end of it. A quick Google search reveals that this isn't Euan's first con nor that Europcar will ever see the promised land.

BEWARE: Euan is a smirking bastard who is out to get you. Be it extra insurance you don't need or ""free"" upgrades.

PLEASE read what you sign.

FURTHER ACTION will be taken via BVRLA.

If you read this and were scammed as well please take action. Do not let them get away with this. We will create a case and if necessary hire a lawyer collectively. Please get in touch.

They also profit off unsuspecting customers by opting out of automatic congestion charge payments, leading to unnecessary penalties. This company operates like a scam – sneaky fees, dishonesty, and zero accountability. DO NOT RENT FROM EUROPCAR! 🚫

Sure, I should have read the contract better, but the person at the counter ensured me that the extra was £40/day, but all of a sudden they charge for insurance, station charge, different fees, just because they had the chance to grab some extra bucks from someone in a very stressful situation.
They also scrolled through the contract and pointed to the signature field without giving me the option to read it beforehand.

Duped Norris,2025-08-13,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/689c35cb5c8c0d8ef6fa8b12,"I had a prepaid car rental voucher for a predetermined type vehicle through a third-party provider. I went to collect the vehicle from EuropCar Gatwick South Terminal to be told by the female EuroCar employee that the vehicle we ordered was not available. She said “We are giving you a free upgrade”. No mention of cost we would pay etc. because we were told they were GIVING us an upgrade. GIVING! It is my understanding that under law, if the company cannot provide the car ordered (and paid for) they must offer either a free upgrade or a lesser vehicle with a monetary refund, The upgrade was a very luxurious vehicle and I was immediately resistant and anxious and expressed deep concern to her, I was told by the female agent not to worry, the vehicle was at the end of its rental life, it had 50,000 miles on the odometer, which it did, and it was to be disposed of when I returned it. Reluctantly I accepted it. I felt it had been foisted upon me. When I was outside loading the car, the female agent came out and said the car had damaged wheels and I had to sign a form to acknowledge the damage. She presented form with a diagram of the car, both sides, with X marks on the wheels. I now realise she had folded the paper in half so that I couldn’t see what was on the other side. I really thought the shonky, trickster days of car hire had long gone. Boy was I wrong!!!
In hindsight I should have said NO! NO! NO and I should have run away, screaming, and rung the third-party provider and complained, but I didn’t, fool that I am. However, after 26 hours of travel I was exhausted, and yes, I now know I was dimwitted not to spot a scam in the making.
I hated the car from the start. This car wrecked my entire holiday and nearly wrecked me. I was highly anxious when I drove it and it made me quite ill from worry, It was too large and too wide for UK parking spaces. It literally got stuck in the entry to a shopping centre car park. It gave my daughter high level anxiety attacks. I had to try to park it away from other cars because I was terrified they would dent the car’s doors. This car was just too big,and too wide for UK narrow roads, even some A roads were scary and it did things I found hard to accept. It was so technical it was dangerous, simply because it was distracting.
But just as importantly, mechanically it was difficult. When the car started off there were many times when it just didn’t want to change up gears. Leaving Cobham Services, the car wouldn’t change gears at all and I held my breath thinking I would need a tow truck, but eventually it did change up. I am used to driving a Subaru with CVT automatic, but this vehicle had a habit of just stopping and not moving off. It would stop and go into Neutral and once you realised why the car wasn’t moving and what had happened, you had to go through the set process to get it going again. This happened in dangerous places at times like waiting to enter a large roundabout on a 70mph road. A friend suggested I return the car and I jolly well wish I had.
On the day I had to return the car to Gatwick, a yellow message about the tyres appeared on the consol. 8 calls to EuropCar proved useless and so I drove just down the road to the local dealership for the marque. Service personnel said it was ok to drive it back and gave me instructions as to what to do with the gadget in the trunk should tyre pressure deteriorate. And this is how I returned the car.
During the term of the car hire I did check my credit card several times to see if EuropCar had levied the £1500 block for security and I was surprised they had not. I returned the car on 1 August and flew home. The day after I arrived home, I checked my credit card and found that at between the 29 July and 9 August (8 days after I had returned the car) EuropCar had charged me $3,630.06 in my money for the upgrade they told me they were GIVING me because they were unable to supply the car I had ordered and prepaid for. It was then that I remembered the woman who asked me to sign the document acknowledging the damage to the car, and it was then that I realised she had folded the document in half and therefore I could not see what was on the other side-the upgrade charges etc.What a Fool I am
I have lodged a dispute but EuropCarUK is notorious for completely ignoring disputes. I am told that what this woman did could be a criminal offence called Fraudulent Misrepresentation. Some could ask whether she is highly skilled in the dark arts of duplicity and deception? Of course I will not be letting this matter go and others in the travel and insurance industries have been advised. Eventually when I can confidently tell the Citizens Advice Bureau,Trading Standards,Watchdog and Rip-off Britain that EuropCar has done absolutely nothing to resolve my dispute,then I will lodge a dispute with the BVRLA to whom EuropCar belong.",0.29978317

My experience...

Save yourself the time and stress: take the rental you plan to give to Europcar, set aside around £20, douse the rest in gasoline, and set it alight. Use the £20 for public transport instead.

I was foolish enough to rent a vehicle from them. I now realise this is not a reputable company but rather a rolling scam—a front for financial abuse masked as fair policy. Whatever you pay in advance, regardless of the booking mediator you use, rest assured, it won’t be the final price. The car you want won’t be available, the cover you obtain through a booking mediator will be ignored, and you’ll be charged for additional coverage (even if you insist you’re already covered).

Effectively, here’s what will happen: you’ll arrive to collect the car you booked. Europcar won’t have it. They’ll offer you a shed on wheels and claim it’s similar to what you reserved. It won’t be. They will then offer an upgrade at an exorbitant rate, trapping you because you need a car to make your holiday work.

When I went to pick car up from Glasgow Airport branch I was scammed from the minute I walked through the door. The young chap with a beard didn't even want to see my car hire voucher as he said he had it on his computer. Asked what car I drove normally I said an automatic as I have rhymathoid arthritis but for a week I would only need a manual which I had booked. Told me he would give me an automatic at no extra cost as I had a disability also said my daughter could be an additional driver in case I wasn't able to drive while I was visiting family. I did sign a form after he said it was a holding deposit which would all be returned after I dropped car off( they took £903 out my account). He folded up paper and put into envelope I made a point in say you haven't charged me any extra have you as my reading eyesight isn't good. Reply not at all madam.

The ombudsman, the ECRCS, found they had mistakenly charged me VAT on the damage - Europcar then took another £1100 from my credit card without refunding me the first charge of £1382.

=====
I recently rented a car from Europcar at Manchester Airport through Trip.com. Upon arrival, I was offered a “free upgrade.” Tired after a 19-hour flight and being unfamiliar with the detailed terms, I trusted the salesperson’s assurances and signed the agreement. To my shock, I later discovered I was charged £847, including fees for services and upgrades I was never informed about.

These charges were not transparently explained during the transaction. While I acknowledge my signature, I believe this was obtained under misleading circumstances. The salesperson’s failure to disclose critical information left me feeling taken advantage of.

I reached out to Trip.com to dispute these charges, but the resolution was unsatisfactory. Despite presenting my case, the charges remain, with no acknowledgment of their lack of transparency.

Unfortunately, I am not alone. After my experience, I found several similar complaints about Europcar’s unclear practices, such as:

TripAdvisor Review of Europcar Heathrow -
1. “Scam Upgrade from Europcar!!”
2. ""Scammed for Extras fees""
3. ""Reddit Post on Europcar Issues - Europcar Heathrow Rental Scam""

My intent in sharing this review is to warn future customers. If you choose Europcar, I strongly recommend documenting every interaction, asking for detailed explanations of all fees, and carefully reviewing the agreement before signing. Transparency and trust are essential, and unfortunately, my experience with Europcar fell far short of this standard.",0.23789045

The other party involved was arrested at the scene, and we have clear photographic evidence and witness statements of the incident. Despite this, Europcar have requested over £1600 in damages be paid by us. We were told by Europcar that if we had paid upfront, we would have received the money back once it had been settled through insurance. It is quite clear that they have no intention of settling this through insurance, as this would have been a straightforward claim and taken weeks to settle, and has now been ongoing for 10 months.

Neither Europcar or their legal representation have respond to our emails. In April, we managed to get a hold of the acting solicitors by phone, where their employee acted surprised and compassionate about what we had to tell her and asked us to send a full account of all evidence, comms with Europcar and witness statements. She assured us that she would be putting the account on hold whilst they investigated further and she would ensure we received responses to our emails (which we never did). It is now 4 months since then, and we have had no update on the outcome of their investigations or notice that the claim had been re-opened.

The rental process was smooth, and I returned the vehicle in perfect condition, with no damage whatsoever. Europcar even refunded my deposit, confirming there were no issues at the time of return.

However, 18 days later, I received an email claiming that I had caused a 5-15 cm scuff on the front bumper. This accusation is completely false. I drove carefully, parked safely, and at no point was the bumper exposed to any situation that could have caused such damage.

I immediately disputed the claim and requested proof, including time-stamped photos and inspection reports. So far, Europcar has not provided clear evidence that the damage occurred while the vehicle was in my possession. Given the time delay, I strongly suspect the damage happened after my rental and that Europcar is unfairly holding me responsible.

This experience has been frustrating, and I now see many similar complaints from other customers. It feels like a deliberate scam to extract extra money from customers long after their rental has ended. Beware! Always take detailed photos and videos before and after your rental to protect yourself.

I always book a rental car via a German trustworthy platform to find the best deal with the best reviews to avoid scams.
We had a small car reserved but Euan at Glasgow Airport gave us a larger car without even mentioning extra costs! The writing on the rental agreement was so bad and resembled the amount in Euros I prepaid but was in fact the extra amount for the upgrade in GBP! Instead of 172.15 Euros, we paid £172 extra for the unsolicited upgrade. He shuffled the papers in front of us, no detailed explanation and we signed. I usually read every single line on these contracts but he had a talent to charm and con us into it.
When I entered the card into the card pay machine, I assumed it is for the deposit. We were not given any receipt for any transaction at any time, again, thinking it is for the deposit.
In the Europcar yard I realised that there were no small cars parked anywhere and again assumed that we got a larger one because they didn't have a small car available.
Only when I checked my bank account when we were back from Scotland, I realised that we got charged for the upgrade on top of the initial payment! A deposit was never taken out of the account. The fact that the money was only taken out of my account 2 weeks after the rental also shows that nothing was done by the book. If I had seen the amount on a receipt or in my transactions straight away, we could have turned on our heels. But if you get deceived in such a way, you don't expect bad intention.

Car returned in August 2024, invoice came in Oct/Nov 2024, I have dispute, as on 18/Dec still not resolved.
Also, I have another contract with them, where a car had a sticker it has been cleaned but in fact there were spiders nets on multiple areas, not cleaned at all, screenwash was completelly dry, with multiple scratches all over and without any evidence in paperwork. The car was in unsafe condition. We phoned multiple times, sent emails, with official letter and photos attached, without any answer or solution. It has been since August 2024, till Dec 2024 still open case, no answer.
On the other hand they want to send my 'unpaid invoice 521 for their damages' to solicitors.
When I sent an email with photos, they replied I have not sent the correct photos, etc.

Charity Today - Office,2024-10-15,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/670e4b62d657eb6a45574c11,"We recently had an incredibly frustrating experience with Europcar, and I cannot express enough how disappointing their service has been. We booked a vehicle online for an important event – our Charity Awards – and provided all the necessary personal details. They had no issue taking our money and conducting an online check. However, after travelling for miles to collect the vehicle, we were told that our investigative journalist could not take the van because he wasn't on the electoral roll.

Why on earth would they allow us to proceed with the booking, travel such a long distance, only to turn us away upon arrival? It wasted an entire day, time we didn’t have to spare, all for nothing. Now, we’re left waiting for a refund that has taken days to process, with no van, no solution, and a serious disruption to our event plans.

My biggest regret was not checking the reviews on here first! Had I seen the experiences others have had, we would never have booked with Europcar in the first place. Thankfully, a local company stepped in last minute to save the day, but the way Europcar handled this situation was absolutely shocking. The lack of communication and care is beyond frustrating. I strongly urge anyone considering renting from Europcar to think again. Don’t waste your time, energy, or money – their service is abysmal!

And Europcar, don’t come at us with the generic response of “we’ll look into this for you” – whatever you are doing is a scam, if not of people's money, their valuable time!",0.20964062

I was flying from Australia to London Heathrow and decided to hire a car from Europcar during the Doha lay over. I selected the car to be picked up at the airport, filled in all the necessary and selected to pay upfront. The process went through up to my bank where it came back with 'there was an error with your bank' (Scam 1)

I found this odd as there were no issues. I tried a different credit card in case - same response. I tried calling Europcar, no answer. I decided to back myself up by selecting a 2nd rental from SIXT but to pay at the airport. Within seconds I received a SIXT confirmation of booking.

We arrived at Heathrow on Sunday 23rd March at around 5pm and decided to first go to Europcar as we had in the interim received an email stating 'YOUR CAR IS WAITING FOR YOU' (SCAM 2), and we had made a payment and if it had gone through whilst we were in flight, we didn't want to pay twice.
But we couldn't find Europcar. We asked SIXT desk and they said it is a shuttle SERVICE (Scam3). We went back to where the shuttle was supposed to be with 2 trolleys of suitcases. No signage. Went to ask again and told it is lane 3. Pushed the trolleys to lane 3 only to find it was not there. Asked again and directed me back to the first point. We waited 20m for a shuttle and a 20m drive to the EUROPCAR satellite office where there was another wait to be served of 15m. By this time it was now 8pm. I got to the front desk eventually, pulled up my email and the Europcar agent says 'you didn't finish your booking?'. I said I did and showed him the email stating 'your car is waiting'. He said that the booking was not confirmed, and the error message showed that. I asked why if the car wasn't available didn't they show this online and how was a customer to know that an error message for payment meant the vehicle wasn't available? He responded with that he could do the booking manually but there would be a price difference (Scam4). On the app it showed a 30GBP difference between online and at airport booking. We were tired and frustrated so said ok to the difference if it was small. We had booked an Electric JEEP for the week at a cost of 284GBP. The guy came back and said it was now 722GBP. I told him that was unacceptable. He said that due to the fire, all cars were booked out and no other rental company would have a car. It was now nearing 9pm, we had to be at a hotel 2hours drive from Heathrow and I think this is Europcar's plan (Scam 5). We refused to pay the price which was almost 3x that of the original booking and seeing we were not buying this scam, he said he could give a discount and we could get it for 520 GBP. The online at airport booking was 309GBP so he was trying his luck with the higher amounts. We refused and asked them to take us back to the airport.
On arrival I went directly to the SIXT desk, was helped by a fantastic and knowledgeable lady and within 10m we had the car which we had selected, at the price we selected. Europcar you could learn a lot from SIXT.
We are frequent travellers and will NEVER RENT FROM EUROPCAR again as they deliberately show cars online that they use to lure customers and then when the travellers are tired take advantage and try to scam by tripling the cost of the vehicle. You should be ashamed of yourself Europcar.",0.20409575

At least this time he was honest and told me that there's nothing I can do and they reached out to me on trust pilot just so they look that they are trying.
Big surprise there...
Wow, this company is rotten to the core.

On April 10th we flew to Heathrow, and we took a shuttle to Europcar to pick up the car we already paid for online.
The guy at the desk started to push a free upgrade, a Mercedes GLE SUV. I said I don’t want it because it is an expensive car, but he insisted, saying that the car is not new and has scratches.
Eventually we agreed and he said there’s a deposit of 284 GBP that will be refunded when we return the car.
That’s when he realized that my wife’s driver’s license is expired, but because he was eager to scam us he finished the papers making her the main driver which should be not only against their policies but also illegal. Of course she didn’t drive at all, I was doing all the driving.
I signed the papers and then he said that because it is a free upgrade a manager will have to sign.
The manager came and he signed then we left. What I didn’t realize was that the manage added a 4 in front of 284 making it 4284 GBP.
Also, we didn’t realize until later that they didn’t take any deposit from the visa (for the obvious reasons).

When we returned the car, we noticed the amount on the back, and we asked to speak to the manager (a different one).
He was right in front of us, but we had to wait about 20 minutes because he was trying to push an upgrade to a family.
Eventually we talked to him and he said that it is our fault for signing and he pretty much called me stupid.
We tried to lock the Visa, but it was too late.

We returned to Canada and immediately called Europcar customer Service and talked to Agostina.
I explained the situation including the expired license. She gave us a case number and said she will e-mail us with a resolution.
After couple of hours we got and e-mail for her saying that our request was respectfully denied.
I called again and talked to Leo. I explained to him the situation again, stressing the fact that the contract should be void because
it was issued knowing that the main driver’s license is expired. He agreed and said that maybe Agostina overlooked that aspect.
He gave me a new case number and said he will e-mail us within a day.
The next day we got the e-mail, and he respectfully denied the refund saying “even in the case Mrs Bogatan would not have a
Valid driving license she would remain the legal hirer as it is her who signed the agreement and paid”. That is incorrect
because it was me who signed and paid the agreement.

At no point in our conversation Leo or Agostina seemed surprised that someone would spend 4284 GBP on an upgrade
for a rental that costed about 350 GBP which makes it obvious that everybody there is part of a big happy bunch f scammers that is Europcar.
We checked online and there is an overwhelming number of negative reviews, lots of them describing situations similar to ours.
I guess I should consider myself lucky for not damaging the car, because apparently that is Europcar’s main way to overcharge customers.

The question is how can big company like this openly rob so may customers without any actions from the authorities?

Eva Rothová,2025-06-11,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/6849362dac277ec55dfd70ab,"My entire experience with Europcar has been nothing short of shocking and deeply disappointing. Upon arriving at the rental desk, I was told that my reservation was ""blocked"" without any clear explanation, despite having a confirmed booking through Carflexi. I was then told I had no choice but to pay double the original price (for a new contract) for a different vehicle on the spot. Feeling pressured and stranded, I had no other choice than to comply.

What followed was a series of deceitful and contradictory actions that made it clear this was not an isolated incident, but rather what felt like a systematic scam.

The agent handling my rental, someone named Sheikh, presented a false ""upgrade"" that I had never agreed to, and I was misled about what I was actually being charged for. It later turned out that I had been mistakenly identified as someone else with the same name, which Europcar themselves admitted in writing, confirming the error was entirely on their side.

However, when I requested a refund for the extra charges caused by their own mistake, Europcar refused to accept any further responsibility. They effectively cut off communication and showed no willingness to resolve the issue, leaving me with no option but to escalate the case to the European Car Rental Conciliation Service (ECRCS).

To make matters worse, days after ECRCS confirmed I would be refunded £157 for the unjustified upgrade fee, Europcar attempted to charge my card an additional £142 without my consent. The only reason this unauthorized charge failed was because I had already transferred all remaining funds from that account, leaving no balance for them to take. I then had to urgently contact my bank and request the card be frozen to prevent any further attempts. This added yet more stress and time to an already exhausting situation.

I have never in my life encountered a company that operates with such blatant disregard for honesty, accountability, and customer trust. I strongly urge others to avoid Europcar, especially at this location (London, Heathrow), unless you are prepared to be deceived, overcharged, and ignored when things go wrong.",0.19532767

In other words, the proposed car did not match the car we explicitly ordered. So after dealing with the papers, she put the paper, which said you had to pay for this upgrade, between the papers to be signed. So we signed these papers blindly and in good faith as she said NOTHING about the extra cost of the upgrade.

At no point was it mentioned that this would have an additional cost. We would have settled this immediately if this was the case and IF we agreed upon an extra cost. The fact that you did not do this until July 26 on your own initiative shows that there was no transparency about this.

We also asked before signing the documents whether there were any additional costs and that was not the case (the lady confirmed this))!
The deposit on my credit card was released only after my phone on 23 July where I had already returned the car on 9 July. The upgrade was also only taken from my credit card at that time whereas normally it should have been done immediately.
This really smells like a scam where they make the customer think they don't have to pay more for their supposedly good service that you pay dearly for. Because I had not booked directly with them, a deposit of 1061 € was reserved on my credit card, which was only released after I had inquired. I called Customer Service 3 times, hung on the line for 15 minutes each time and then put the phone down without explanation. NEVER AGAIN EUROPCAR!

Returned again to show Eurocar car video and they agreed and informed me that they would note no claim to head office. This has not been done and even though I made a complaint two weeks ago, apology and resolution has not been forthcoming.
Eurocar exaggerated the damage which I was not responsible for to scam me out of has much money has they could. Avoid with extreme caution. Never going there again or would ever recommend. Luckily I took a video prior to hiring van

Michael Gregory,2024-08-18,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/66c19ee76fd527a11e906ece,"My car needed a new gear box, so I ordered a hire vehicle similar to mine, 7 seater, while I waited for mine to be repaired, I got no notification of car arriving on site for over 3 weeks! No hand over, no documentation signed, nothing, I got to the car, it would not start, it also looked like a banger car, I put that aside, and used it as normal, due to the looks and no information on the car, I did not refuel due to the potential of filling up with the wrong fuel, they charged me just short of £100 for 1/4 of a tank.......I sent emails explaining the poor communication and mis management from their side, but they took the money and told me it's in the terms and agreements, that I did not sign? Regardless of how many times I tell them, I did not sign anything. Clearly this is a failing company and will scam you out of any penny they can, AVOID find another firm to use.",0.13531056

I hired a car in Thailand was NOT the car I paid for and had 130,000 miles on it with as you can imagine quite a bit of damage. However that’s not the worst Eurocar scam to look out for. I have just had money taken out of my account almost 2 months after the hire for an undisclosed reason , my communications and phone calls resulted in them basically telling me it’s not their problem and for me to deal with it so Europcar are saying it’s not Europcars problem you need to speak to Europcar. A total scam and absolutely not willing to help anyone resolve the issue so likely an orchestrated and common occurrence. Best approach would be to not use them and be careful with other car rentals .

Muratti,2024-10-11,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/6709229c175280fb9558e226,"I have hired cars and vans from Europcar many times before and the last one was only 3-4 months ago . I again made a booking with them and received an email to upload my passport ,driving licence and take a selfie to complete check-in online . And shortly after that received another e mail as my checking completed and documents have been validated. When I went to office in Glasgow Lancefield Quay a gentleman call Sam asked my address details and asked my driving licence then said ohhh we did a soft credit search and we are not able to hire you a car . And then he advised me to speak customer service to explain situation and then I called them and the person I spoke on the phone diverted my call to a manager - I then find out he is the manager for their airport branch and he spoke to me on the phone and then he spoke to his colleague on the desk and speaker was on and I was able to hear . Once he started to be rude then his colleague put the speaker off !! Then I left the place with big disappointment as never had this before anywhere !!! So be careful before booking a car with them as they can confirm your booking online but once you arrive their office then they can say sorry we can't hire you a car !!! Doesn't matter you come from abroad and have important meetings, important events ,plans etc !!! All they care to cheat !!! I would never ever go with that company again !!! That's scam !!!",0.10929241
Karl,2025-05-01,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/68134cfb23e95bf995d20576,What a trapdoor this company is. Stay away please take my advice. The errors this company has made against me has cost me thousands of pounds. I am currently trying to retrieve over £1100 that Europcar took out of my account on a saturday morning without any authorisation and having never had a hire car from them. I tried to get a hire the previous month for work for 30 days. I entered everything for them and paid in full before going to collect the car from Manchester airport. When I got there the very aggressive and uninterested staff informed me that they were going to do a credit check on my address. I was not worried as I own my own house lived there for years and don't do credit or debt. The guy comes back and refuses me the car hire. I'm like hang on this can't be right. Also why was this check not done before I'd paid my money. The staff refused to help me I any way and would not allow me to speak to a more senior member of staff. There message to me was go somewhere else you are not getting anything from us today. I was left standing there having giving up the day to collect the car in the first place. I was informed that it would take 20 days to get my money back. Europcar held my money in their account making interest for days before I eventually got it back. No car and no money for 10 days. I launched an investigation to find out why my address had an issue only to find out that the poorly educated and extremely rude member of staff had entered next doors address. I feel he did it on purpose. These guys were a real bad bunch at Manchester Airport Branch. On the 28th April for no reason Europcar took from my account the money again. I have still nor had it back. There is no one to complain to at Europcar there is no real customer service to speak off. These accessed my personal data withdraw money from my account and have held onto it. I have had to register it as a theft with he police I've had to buy a vehicle in order to start my new job at the cost of £8000 taxed and insured lost days in work as a result of it. I don't think I've ever been so badly treated by a company in my life. I actually thought that this type of behaviour by a company was not possible in this day and age but it is. Don't be fooled by this company with the green t-shirt and little euro logo this guys are scam artists and should not be trading at all. I will be bring to the whole thing to trading standards and data protection etc. I never take the time to write reviews but I am writing this to try and save others from being scared like I was. Please stay away from these guys especially at the Manchester Airport branch.,0.09188578
Elaine Whillock,2024-08-21,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/66c56db55484560613c688b7,"I booked a car via Carjet and they gave me the contact number for the car dealer at Prestwick Airport to collect the car called Keddy. They also told me I had to pay an additional 800E holding deposit. When I called the number a guy called Kris from Europcar answered and explained they are not actually based at Prestwick Airport but agreed to pick me up and then drop me back. He also explained Carjet are always making mistakes and a nightmare to deal with . On arrival he picked me up and I was only offered an automatic car even though I only ever have driven manual,but this was all he had to offer me . He also asked for a 700E holding deposit on my card which I accepted. I had to watch YouTube videos to figure out how to actually drive the car as I got stuck a few times. When I returned the car ,he told me everything was absolutely fine and said I'd be returned the 700E in a few hours . They did return the 700E but then deducted 78E and I contacted him to ask what this was for . He ignored my messages for days . And when I chased him up 5 days later he acted as if he didn't know who I was and asking for the booking reference number . I then sent him all the information he needed. 25 days later I still never received a response, apology or explanation. The whole thing is an absolute SCAM . WILL NEVER RECOMMEND CARJET OR EUROPCAR PRESTWICK TO ANYONE. SCAM COMPANIES!!!!!!",0.08772957
