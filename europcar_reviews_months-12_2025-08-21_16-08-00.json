Efficient, polite and helpful all through the pick up process he's a credit to the company. The car was clean, in great condition and drop off was super efficient a couple of days later. Very good experience. Thank you!"

She is still waiting for a refund and being fed a load of lies from Europcar even with them having accepted liability for the error and told her that the money was released 2 weeks ago. Its now a month since it happened. On top of this, the car has been returned and their pre authorisations have not been released and the deposit has not been returned.\nTheir continued moving of timelines and this behavior has to be illegal as I do not understand how they can simply take money out of a bank account when the customer has not authorised it. Tesco can't do that with shopping."

      "text": "The booking.com website led me to Keddy by Europcar at Valencia airport in July with the promise of \"no queues\" but I had to wait more than 30 minutes to collect on arrival. I reserved a \"T-Roc or similar\" and tried to pre-empt me not getting \"or similar\" by contacting Europcar (Madrid) in advance. They responded with a \"we cannot promise anything\" and indeed when I arrived was given a Hyundai Tucson covered in scratches with a flogged engine 65k on the clock. Europcar then pre-authorised 800 Euros on my credit card in case of collision even though I had paid an extra 70 pounds to booking.com for full additional insurance (excess insurance). I hated the Hyundai Tucson. The safety features were infuriating with the parking brake auto-hold not having a light on the console and the locked patrol cap. The staff were very polite at Europcar Valencia airport but the experience was a let-down. One week after returning the car I noticed a further charge from Europcar on my credit card. When I contacted them they said it was an \"environmental contribution\" charged to me in error when it should have been charged to the intermediary (i.e. booking.com). Long story short I would avoid using either Europcar or booking.com for a car rental in the future."

I inspected the car reasonably thoroughly and could not see any damage.\n\nOn returning the car the member of staff immediately identified what she claimed was damage but to my mind was a mark on the rear bumper that was hardly visible and not possible to see without wiping away the water marks. Nevertheless, the staff member required me to sign the Statement of Return acknowledging the damage. She told me that is it was the only way I would get my deposit back and also implied that the damage would be assessed by an expert and would probably not be an issue. As I was in a hurry to catch my flight I signed document."

      "text": "Unbelievable experience with this awful company and the partner companies I have had to deal with.\nBooked a Citroen C3 fuel car for 12 days in Tolouse in late July. (almost £300 total) . I used the GOTrentalcars website to book the car from Europcar.\n\nMy Ryanair flight was late so I got to the Europcar at 12.30am. They did not have the Citroen C3. They insisted I had booked an electric car of the lowest category. ( Major Red Flag) I insisted I hadn't because I deliberately excluded electric cars when booking. The electric car they wanted to give me could only drive for 1 hour before needing charging. I would never have willingly booked this.\n\nThey only had 1 fuel car to offer me but it was going to cost an extra £60 PER DAY!!! I was absolutely stuck, I had a young child with me and it was 1am on a saturday night, I had to drive for 1.5 hours to get to our accomodation. I was forced to get the fuel car at £60 extra per day but they said I could try and explain the next day and change it. All day Sunday and Monday was ruined because I was trying to sort out the situation on the phone and eventually just had to go back to return the car and try to get refunded for the 10 days. But they still have not refunded me. ( RED FLAG - staff directly lied to me)\nHowever the Europcar staff at Toulouse airport were completely UNHELPFUL and RUDE. RED FLAG. I had an argument with them in the Toulouse airport. I parked the car near their returns office and went away for an hour.\n\nWhen I came back to return the car, they said there was a dimple on the rear door. RED FLAG! I KNOW that I hadn't ever touched this door or seen the dimple when I checked the car over. I think they did it out of malice for my complaining. I asked to check cctv but there wasnt any. They forced me to sign a thing saying I had created the dimple. I definitely did not. It is so small that I took a close-up photo and you still can't see it. They have taken £800 out of my bank account. They have not even refunded me 10 days' worth of £ that I had paid.\n\nEvery staff member that I spoke to from GOTrental cars and Europcar says I signed the contract in the first place for the car. I keep saying I was FORCED to sign it because I was stuck in the middle of the night with a child and they did not have the car I had booked. I am being totally GASLIT by these theiving, tricking, fraudulent blatant liars, and they now owe me £1200 plus 2 days of my holiday plus petrol and toll money to return the wrong car.\n\nTHEY WILL NOT GET AWAY WITH THIS."

      "text": "After using this company for car rentals quite often over a few years, I thought I'd grown to trust them as one of the better car rental companies that weren't out to scam you at every possible opportunity.\n\nUnfortunately, I was proven wrong when I was handed a cleaning fee for having some dirt, from a shoe, in the footwell of the car. This was deemed excessive and upon querying the matter, I was told this would require 'expert third party cleaners ' and 'the cleaning of a interior specialist'.\n\nDirect quotes, yet evidence of this was never produced and I was ignored for over a month before receiving a dismissive email saying they will not be replying any more.\n\nIf only photos were allowed on this platform to show how little dirt was apparently deemed to be excessive. I have since moved to using other car rental companies, as this lack of customer service for a long-standing customer, or anyone, is just not good enough.\n\nI will be reporting them to the British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association for breaching their code of conduct in their handling of this matter."

I hired another vehicle with Europcar earlier this year and had no problems paying the deposit using this card.\n\nGot to the branch to be told by staff that they don't accept Monzo so I couldn't hire the car. Nobody could explain why this was their policy, only that they had to cancel the booking.\n\nI offered to make a full payment for the deposit amount which could be refunded when I returned the car, but the staff weren't having it either. I spoke to the branch manager, who could only tell me that they didn't accept Monzo and I'd have to cancel my booking.\n\nThis policy seems to be based on the understanding that Monzo cards aren't \"real debit cards\", which doesn't seem to be true.\n\nIn the end, I had to ask my friend to travel to the branch with another card, and Europcar refuse to cover the costs of this even though (1) they literally told me to bring the card I used to pay for the booking and (2) their terms say they accept debit cards.\n\nEuropcar's customer service have just ignored my attempts to get them to refund me for these costs, or to at least explain their policy. Useless.\n\nIf anyone from Europcar reads this, my case number is 23955880."

I gave up on that and called the head office of Europcar to discuss the matter. The woman name was lynne who insisted that they had sent a email for recovery of damage. I then checked my junk mail and found 2 emails from Europcar. One was the invoice from them on the 04/06/2025 saying the car was ok and the deposit would be returned\nWhich it was by Europcar.\n\nThen on the the 23/06/2025 I have another email regarding the damage to the car ( which was a flat tyre and I picture of the tyre with the nail in it.\n3 weeks after the so called nail was in the tyre they contact me to inform me that I must of done it and they were going to charge me for the time it was off the road a new tyre and admin fees of 251.64. Something I did not know about til now.\nI know I checked the car out and it did not have a puncture as I checked all aspects at of it with a friend who assisted me in the process. At no point was the car damaged or anything wrong with it.\nHow can this company say the car was ok and issue an invoice on the 4th June 2025 and then 3 weeks later decide that the car had a puncture and decide to send me a bill.\nThey must of done this when driving the car round the car park or someone else who hired it and the only person they could blame was the last person who drove it. This is wrong on all levels and I will contest it as it looks like they are blaming anyone they can. Absolute disgrace from Europcar and as a company I used to use regularly I won’t be using again and I will tell anyone who is using this company do not use them as they are not true to there words of being a good company who cares about the drivers."

Europcar is a scam company that happily takes money from customers but doesn’t provide the car you booked. They confirmed my reservation and took my payment without doing the necessary checks. I travelled all the way to London City Airport, only to be told I couldn’t collect the car.\n\nThis company wastes people’s time and money, and it feels like they take bookings just to hold customers’ money for their own interest.

In the end, we had to hire a car in Huntingdon and drive up to Scotland, and as Europcar had said they would refund me the full amount and didn't have a branch in Huntingdon, we used Enterprise - brilliant service, better car and cost £50 less anyway despite being a one-way hire with unlimited mileage.

      "text": "We returned our car to Izmir Airport on 21/06/25, and as of 13/08/25 are yet to have our €300 security deposit returned.\n\nWe have made multiple phone calls and emails to attempt to get this resolved and are yet to hear anything back. We waited 30 working days, as advised, before emailing the Customer Service UK email address on 01/06/25, and only received a NoReply, automated response on 06/08/25 with no real update or additional information regarding our query- it was clear that it was sent automatically and not by a real person.\n\nEuropcar are contractually obliged to return this money to us, yet we do not have it- or any correspondence from them about it at all!\n\nWe will begin pursuing legal action if we do not hear back or receive our money back by the end of the week.\n\nThis is unfortunate because the car itself was lovely and the staff in Turkey very helpful, and the staff who assisted in making the booking were also helpful. We only went with Europcar because we believed them to be reputable, but will not be using them again after this experience.\n\nIf Europcar would like to reach out as a response to this review then I would very much welcome it, as all we really want at this point is our money back. I will be happy to provide our booking reference if so."

      "text": "I had a prepaid car rental voucher for a predetermined type vehicle through a third-party provider. I went to collect the vehicle from EuropCar Gatwick South Terminal to be told by the female EuroCar employee that the vehicle we ordered was not available. She said “We are giving you a free upgrade”. No mention of cost we would pay etc. because we were told they were GIVING us an upgrade. GIVING! It is my understanding that under law, if the company cannot provide the car ordered (and paid for) they must offer either a free upgrade or a lesser vehicle with a monetary refund, The upgrade was a very luxurious vehicle and I was immediately resistant and anxious and expressed deep concern to her, I was told by the female agent not to worry, the vehicle was at the end of its rental life, it had 50,000 miles on the odometer, which it did, and it was to be disposed of when I returned it. Reluctantly I accepted it. I felt it had been foisted upon me. When I was outside loading the car, the female agent came out and said the car had damaged wheels and I had to sign a form to acknowledge the damage. She presented form with a diagram of the car, both sides, with X marks on the wheels. I now realise she had folded the paper in half so that I couldn’t see what was on the other side. I really thought the shonky, trickster days of car hire had long gone. Boy was I wrong!!!\nIn hindsight I should have said NO! NO! NO and I should have run away, screaming, and rung the third-party provider and complained, but I didn’t, fool that I am. However, after 26 hours of travel I was exhausted, and yes, I now know I was dimwitted not to spot a scam in the making.\nI hated the car from the start. This car wrecked my entire holiday and nearly wrecked me. I was highly anxious when I drove it and it made me quite ill from worry, It was too large and too wide for UK parking spaces. It literally got stuck in the entry to a shopping centre car park. It gave my daughter high level anxiety attacks. I had to try to park it away from other cars because I was terrified they would dent the car’s doors. This car was just too big,and too wide for UK narrow roads, even some A roads were scary and it did things I found hard to accept. It was so technical it was dangerous, simply because it was distracting.\nBut just as importantly, mechanically it was difficult. When the car started off there were many times when it just didn’t want to change up gears. Leaving Cobham Services, the car wouldn’t change gears at all and I held my breath thinking I would need a tow truck, but eventually it did change up. I am used to driving a Subaru with CVT automatic, but this vehicle had a habit of just stopping and not moving off. It would stop and go into Neutral and once you realised why the car wasn’t moving and what had happened, you had to go through the set process to get it going again. This happened in dangerous places at times like waiting to enter a large roundabout on a 70mph road. A friend suggested I return the car and I jolly well wish I had.\nOn the day I had to return the car to Gatwick, a yellow message about the tyres appeared on the consol. 8 calls to EuropCar proved useless and so I drove just down the road to the local dealership for the marque. Service personnel said it was ok to drive it back and gave me instructions as to what to do with the gadget in the trunk should tyre pressure deteriorate. And this is how I returned the car.\nDuring the term of the car hire I did check my credit card several times to see if EuropCar had levied the £1500 block for security and I was surprised they had not. I returned the car on 1 August and flew home. The day after I arrived home, I checked my credit card and found that at between the 29 July and 9 August (8 days after I had returned the car) EuropCar had charged me $3,630.06 in my money for the upgrade they told me they were GIVING me because they were unable to supply the car I had ordered and prepaid for. It was then that I remembered the woman who asked me to sign the document acknowledging the damage to the car, and it was then that I realised she had folded the document in half and therefore I could not see what was on the other side-the upgrade charges etc.What a Fool I am\nI have lodged a dispute but EuropCarUK is notorious for completely ignoring disputes. I am told that what this woman did could be a criminal offence called Fraudulent Misrepresentation. Some could ask whether she is highly skilled in the dark arts of duplicity and deception? Of course I will not be letting this matter go and others in the travel and insurance industries have been advised. Eventually when I can confidently tell the Citizens Advice Bureau,Trading Standards,Watchdog and Rip-off Britain that EuropCar has done absolutely nothing to resolve my dispute,then I will lodge a dispute with the BVRLA to whom EuropCar belong."

      "text": "I booked a car for the month of August 25 and needed to make a small correction to the pickup location all other details remained the same - duration timings etc. I notified the customer care department almost immediately to explain the situation. I was subsequently notified that there was nothing they could do with 5 days notice before pickup and that I would either need to pick up the car as per the original booking or lose the rental money 840 pounds. I am on holiday, required the car for the duration of the holiday and was forced to rent another car whilst I contest the problem - simply ridiculous people.\nI got no help from customer care, I raised a claim ( complaint) and was told the SLA for turnaround was up to 5 working days. Needless to say no reply to the complaint, it’s like pulling teeth with the zombies in customer care and now need to take them to an arbitration court.\nBe very careful folk, this is a company that I have since found out are notorious for this type of thing and other abuses.\nWill never touch these clowns again for the sake of my health."

Yet, £214.41 was deducted from my credit card — part of which they admit was £180.18 for Roadside Assistance, which I never intended to buy. That leaves £34.23 unexplained.\n\n2️⃣ Misleading Upselling\nDespite already having full insurance, I was pressured to buy Roadside Assistance at pickup. The staff explicitly told me it would not cost extra and was “included in the basic insurance.” This is clearly false and designed to exploit tourists unfamiliar with UK rental terms.\n\n3️⃣ Admin Fees Without Proof\nCharged £45 per “admin fee” for supposed fines or tolls — yet no evidence or notice was ever provided.\n\n❗ Avoid Europcar.

Instead, the woman at the desk tried to hand us a much smaller car — one that wouldn’t have fit our luggage. When we pointed this out, she suddenly offered us a van instead. We had to insist multiple times that we had paid for an SUV and expected what we reserved.\n\nAfter “checking with the fleet manager” (twice), she miraculously located the exact vehicle we had booked — which had apparently been “unavailable” moments earlier. When we reached the car park, we saw at least half a dozen other MG ZS SUVs in plain sight, and another couple who had also just been given a van instead of the car they were promised.\n\nThen came the handling of a parking fine administration fee. I had already successfully disputed the fine and notified Europcar with evidence before they charged my card. Despite this, they still took the £45 fee and made me chase them down multiple times — even rejecting a screenshot of the cancellation and demanding a PDF version of the exact same message. This is not how you treat a customer — especially one who proactively followed the rules and provided the relevant information in good faith.\n\nIf this is how Europcar handles both reservations and basic customer service, I’d strongly recommend choosing a different company."

I understand the basis for the policy but staff claimed that nobody had any discretion on how to apply it and there was nobody who could be contacted with any discretion. I’ve used them a fair bit in the past but I never will again, obviously thinks very little of the care for their customers."

Such a dodgy company.\n\nWas forced into paying for the damage waiver in France as the operative simply would not stop badgering, knew I was in a rush and refused to give me the keys until I purchased the upgrade.\n\nThey tell you not to bother inspecting the car because you won’t be charged. THIS IS NOT TRUE. Dropping the car off there was a scratch on the paintwork which looked historic. Whilst I accept I should’ve checked and said something, I relied on what I was told that I didn’t need to check. I highlighted that the scratch looked historic and the operative at the other end even agreed. He told me to simply sign the form saying we’d spoken about it and not to worry as I wouldn’t be charged anyway as I had signed the damage waiver.\n\nWell, I wake up to a £100 “damage admin fee” - so I was charged. With my invoice I had a link to press to complain, this sent me to a form that I completed. The response to that form was “you’ve contacted the wrong Europcar, you need to contact Europcar France not Europcar UK”.\n\nThe buck-passing began there. I asked repeatedly why I wasn’t allowed to rely on the representations made that I wouldn’t be charged both before I signed the contract and after and was told the T&C’s applied (which was in direct contradiction to what I was told). The response was only “you signed the form acknowledging the damage”. If I had known about the charge (and gone against what 2 members of staff said too my face), I wouldn’t have signed it.\n\nBeware. Beware. Beware. They will hoodwink you, pressurise you and after all of that, still charge you. Hidden fees are their speciality it seems.\n\nWill never touch Europcar again and I can only recommend you do the same."

On the second of the two occasions I hired a car here, this lack of a pre-hire check was used in an attempt to make me pay for pre-existing damage to the wheel and tyre. The person I handed the car back to spotted this very minor blemish so quickly that I can only assume that they knew it was there and needed someone to pin it on.\n\nHowever, while Europcar doesn't do pre-hire checks, I do and I had photos to prove that the damage was there when I collected the car. The person I handed the car over to couldn't have been less interested in this despite this being an opportunity to wrap things up there and then. He was clearly desperate to pass this up the chain, claiming that he would get in trouble if he didn't.\n\nThe matter was passed to Europcar's damage team, who are slow, incompetent and impertinent. After almost a month of exchanges, Europcar have gracelessly and grudgingly conceded that they were wrong and I've been informed that I will not be charged for damage that someone else caused.\n\nI certainly won't be using this shady outfit again. If you do, I'd strongly advise you to take a comprehensive and clear photographs of every aspect of the car, interior as well as exterior photographs. Time stamp them if possible. If I hadn't done this I'd have been a few hundred pounds out of pocket."

      "text": "I would like to give a review about my experience at Europcar by Birmingham airport today. The front desk employee named “Bryan” (black guy at desk) mistreated me and my uncle so badly today. I came to the branch desperate for a car as I broke down and I needed something for the morning to commute to work. The first thing Bryan told me and reassured me was dont worry we have enough cars for you today and showed me all the cars they had in the carpark. I felt a bit better because thats what I needed to hear. Once he found out that Im desperate for a car as I broken down and once he found out what do I do for work everything changed. So online it was showing they have availabity for an Audi A3 coming all together around £250 for 4 days (second driver included) I did not book it online as I was unsure if they accept debit or credit card. So I turned up to the branch, even then I needed my uncle to book as I am currently waiting for my debit card to come home so in this case he would pay , and I can transfer him the money and I can drive to work.\nLet’s go back at the point when “Bryan” found out how desperate I was for a car. He only offered me a Fiat punto for first £389, (after I told my uncle to make way and come to the branch) then I asked him how come online it says I can get an audi for almost half the price he said no you cannot no you cannot without giving me an answer as I was confused. Fair enough he wanted me to pay double, my uncle asked a question so which other cars do you have and Bryan looked at him weird asking for translation as my uncle english is not perfect but he is a manager at a wholesale place I can assure he has a degree, who is Bryan to make joke of his english?. This completely made me think he was being racist to us. I then asked, ok so what if I book a car for 2 hours later as per online procedure and it was showing I can get an A3 for £250 for 4 days what would you do then if you saying you cannot give me that one as its gone? He did not bother giving me a proper answer and instead of helping me save money or finding a solution to my problem he decided to just say mate you can have the Fiat punto for £456 now or I’ll just tell you to walk out mate. What? So the price gone up for me asking few questions or my uncle asking a question?\nTHIS IS NOT HOW YOU TREAT A CUSTOMER IN NEED OF HELP, I DO NOT KNOW WHO GAVE TRAINING TO THIS GUY BUT PEOPLE AT DESKS ARE MEANT TO HELP CUSTOMER AND NOT CHARGE EXTRA EXTORTION PRICES. IM REALLY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS EXPERIENCE AS I WASTED ALMOST 3 HOURS OF MY TIME AND ALL I GOT IN RETURN WAS THIS GUY TRYING TO SHOW HIS POWER AND BE RACIST TO MY UNCLE PLUS STRESS TO FIND A CAR FOR MORNING. Really disappointed in you guys, because of Bryan I will have to catch a taxi early in the morning and back home. Meanwhile the other guy at the desk was the opposite, he went home at 7.30/8 pm but was willing to help his attitude was really nice I wish he stayed and dealt with my query. Also the guy bringing the cars was really kind too. Bryan Instead he could have decided to help me saying, mate book it for the morning or tomorrow online it might be cheaper or better cars etc….Is this how you treat customers in need of help? Charge extra amounts to show your powers? I have rented cars of you guys before and a lot of my friends and family have in the past hence I came. But after this experience with BRYAN do you think they would want to book again?"

      "text": "Europcar Heathrow.\nArrived off a 32-hour flight from New Zealand. Tired and disorientated I arrived at the desk ready to produce my CarTrawler.com voucher for the 30-day rental. This was not required, apparently. I asked about an upgrade to a car with automatic transmission and was told that one was available at an additional 25 GBP per day. I was told by Danielle that because she was not (now) going to be charging me for the additional driver (upon the return of the vehicle) that additional cost would only ‘feel’ like 5 GBP per day as the additional driver would have otherwise been charged at 20 GBP per day. We signed the documents, drove away and then 30 minutes later realised we’d been well and truly conned by Danielle.\n\nThe cost of the additional driver, for the original vehicle or for the upgrade was NOT 20 GBP per day (or 600 GBP in total). It’s only 186 GBP for the whole period (according to their website) for the upgraded vehicle. I phoned Customer Services from a service station on the M5, who also said that the 186 was too cheap and it they’d never offer an additional driver for less that 13 GBP per day.\n\nSo, having already paid 1,034 GBP for the original vehicle I was stung for another 1,035 GBP for the upgrade. The payment was taken out of my bank account, and this prompted an email to their customer services. Several emails later, during which I was told that “You’ve signed the documents, so you had to pay”, and that “I (the customer service rep) was not there when you had the conversation with Danielle, so I can’t confirm or corroborate what was said and so can’t offer a refund for the difference” etc etc, it went on.\n\nThe upgrade vehicle, should I have booked that originally, would have cost me 1,390 +186 = 1,576. I was conned out of 492 GBP. I wasn’t asking for a refund for the whole amount, just this difference. I would have been happy to pay the correct price for the vehicle that I had.\n\nThe whole ‘show’ was a farce. “For this deal I need to get my manager to sign this off. It’s that good” (Danielle). The whole things was a well-practiced hustle.\n\nThis whole experience really played on my mind for the whole of my holiday in the UK. This experience and realisation of their wrongdoing was something I was unable to reconcile with.\n\nAvoid, avoid, avoid. I hope my that by writing this I can help others to avoid a similar experience.\n\nReply from Owner following my Google review . .\n\"Hello David,\n\nWe appreciate your feedback and we are sorry to learn you were dissatisfied with our service.\n\nGive us the chance to solve the issue by providing more details using this link **** where our customer service team will be in touch.\"\n\nTotal waste of time. No change in stance, just \"Europcar UK have provided you with an explanation for the fee you raised. Based on the information available and the explanation from Europcar UK, we regret to inform you that the upgrade fee is valid and cannot be waived.\""

When I declined, I was rudely dismissed and then told the only option was a tiny Fiat 500 — completely unsuitable for a family.\n\nOther customers were facing the same issue, including those who had booked weeks in advance. The staff were rude, unhelpful, and took a “tough luck” attitude with everyone. I was even told it was my fault for booking “too late” — despite their system accepting my payment and confirming availability.\n\nThe whole experience was chaotic, unprofessional, and completely ruined the start of our family holiday. I had to get a refund and find an alternative at the last minute. Easily the worst customer service I’ve ever experienced. Never again."

After several minutes of selling, the upgrade would have cost a ridiculous amount so we stuck with our original car. The real bug bear is that we verbally agreed to return the car with a full tank of petrol, which we refilled at Birchanger services next to Stansted. Expecting a refund of the fuel deposit we paid of £47.04 and after re fuelling at a further cost of £18.63 thus totalling £65.67. Did we receive the deposit back, No. We contacted Europcar who opened a case but sadly even though the vehicle showed we had refilled the car to the exact amount that was in the tank originally they would not refund the deposit. This seems to us to be extremely unfair. Be very wary."

      "text": "I rented a van from Europcar on the 13th of June and returned it the following day, the 14th. While I’ll admit their vehicles are quite lovely and modern, that’s about the only good thing I can say. The rest of the experience was a full-blown disaster.\nI used the van to move boxes to my new house, driving a total of just 38 miles. However, when I went to refill the tank before returning it, I had to put in 14.61 litres of diesel. That’s laughably excessive. For context, I drive a diesel SUV 64 miles round-trip to work daily, and that uses only 4–5 litres. So how did 38 miles in a van burn through nearly triple that?\nThe answer is simple: the vehicle wasn’t filled up properly when I received it. The digital fuel gauge can be deceiving, giving the impression of a full tank even when it’s not. I mentioned this immediately upon return, only to be told that maybe the heavy boxes I moved caused it. A flimsy excuse at best.\nI raised a formal complaint online on June 15th, expecting the promised \"7 working day\" resolution. It's now well past that, and I’ve received nothing but silence and disgraceful customer service. I've been hung up on twice after providing my complaint reference, and on one occasion, I was subjected to the rudest, most unhelpful call imaginable. Not once did anyone seem remotely interested in resolving the issue.\nIf you're thinking of using Europcar, don’t unless you’re prepared to be ignored, insulted, and treated like a nuisance the moment you raise a concern. Their complaint process is more like a black hole. Once you're in, expect no return.\nAvoid Europcar. Their shiny cars hide a rusty, soulless machine underneath."

This meant the office would be closed when we arrived at midnight. I phoned the local office to tell them I would be arriving late hoping they would stay open the extra 30 minutes. They told me that they wouldn’t stay open longer and if I don’t collect before they closed I would be a “no show” and I would lose my booking and all the pre paid money. I asked if i could collect the next morning, and was told no because they would have already cancelled the booking and put me down as now show. They suggested I call customer\nServices, which would be great but that was closed at 4pm on Sunday. I tried to modify my booking online but that was just trying to charge me £300 more to have a booking 1 day shorter. To avoid the no show fee I had to cancel the booking online. WHY could I not just pick up the car a day later as I had already paid the full amount!! Side note noticed the hertz desk has stayed open late to meet the flight. After starting a customer complaint, Europcar informed me they re within their rights to not refund my deposit as I didn’t give 48 hours notice to cancel. This leads me to think they would have actually kept all my money and put me as a no “show “. Will not be using Europcar again and hope others learn from my experience."

Even more outrageous, I checked online and the same car was available for £170 over the same 2-day period.\n\nWhen I asked why, I was told the only option was to return the vehicle all the way back to Edinburgh Airport (a 140-mile round trip for me), start a new booking, and drive off again — all for something I was told could be handled over the phone for an additional £80 total.\n\nI raised this as a complaint and was told to contact the Edinburgh depot directly. After 5 separate attempts and 5 hours on hold over 2 days, I gave up — which I suspect is exactly what they count on.\n\nI went back to the main number and asked to speak with customer service, only to be told:\n“It’s what the computer says — there’s nothing we can do.”\n\nAbsolutely disgraceful service, zero accountability, and pricing that borders on predatory.\nBE AWARE before booking with Europcar.\n\nReservation number:\n1191262518"

After I booked the car in the UK, I phoned Europcar and asked if they sold damage waiver Insurance (I normally buy it separately online). I was told that it wasn't necessary as all their cars were fully covered under the rental agreement. At the Faro desk, I agreed to pay for a vehicle upgrade, and they asked me for a large amount of deposit to cover damage. Realising that I did need damage waiver, I told them I was just going buy the damage waiver online for £42 for the 8 days i needed. The desk staff said they would sell it to me for £24, so I accepted. When my credit card bill came through, they had charged me £24 a day! They also charged me around an extra £50 to collect the car! I have phoned and written to complain, but they don't care. Of course they don't - it's their way of operating - deceitfuly. I'm really dissapointed, I thought they were a reputable company 😔"

      "text": "I hired a car from Trieste Ronchi Airport on 22 June 2025, and returned it in Bologna on Thur. 26 June.\n\nThe pick up process went OK, but the car's conditions were worse than those described on the contract. This forced me to take something like 18 pictures of various damages and return to the office to report one of them in particular. This was particularly unpleasant as I had to do this under the scorching sun at about 37 degrees; it would be greatly appreciated if Europcar could rent some parking slots in the shade.\n\nBut the worst was still to come. The documentation I had been emailed when I booked contained 2 different addresses where to return the car in Bologna. When I asked about this on the pick-up day, the person behind the desk (Sig.ra Ilenia) said that, actually, both of these addresses were wrong, and gave me a third address (\"V. Matteotti, 5 - Bologna\"). She mentioned that, when I reached the car park, I should go to level -1. That was it.\n\nOn the last day, car return time was 15:00. Google map said it would take me 15 minutes to drive to the alleged return address (Via Matteotti, 5); I left at 1:45pm (1h 15min early).\nIndeed, after less than 20 mins, I reached \"via Matteotti\"; however, when I started looking for no. 5, there was no “no. 5” anywhere. The numbering jumped from no. 1 to no. 7; in between, there was a huge bridge over the railway, and, after the bridge, Bologna's main Railway Station's car park.\nThe car park entrance had no indication suggesting that this might *also* be the place where rental cars had to be returned. There was NO Europcar sign to be seen anywhere, nor were there any other rental companies' signs, which would have hinted this could have been the correct location.\n\nI stopped and called Europcar office in Bologna for some indications. It was about 2:10-15pm. Nobody answered. I tried several times, for about 5 minutes, but nobody picked up.\n\nThe clock was ticking. Given that I had 3 (three) different addresses where to return the car, and that, amongst those, one was Europcar's main offices', I decided to drive there, as the address placed it nearby.\nAfter another 10 minutes, I managed to locate Europcar's office entrance, parked, and walked there.\n\nIt was 14:30, under a scorching sun (37 degrees C). When I got there, the office was closed. The sign on the door said \"14:30\" as the afternoon opening times. I waited for a few minutes, while occasionally ringing the bell, and insistently knocking on the office door.\nNo answer. Nobody was visible through the glass windows.\nIt was now past 14:35, the return time was approaching, and the door remained closed. I tried to call Europcar's office number again: no answer.\nAt that point I noticed a small sign (written in Italian) next to the office's door, stating that, should the office be closed, the car key should be dropped off at Europcar's car park located in the ** main train station's car park ***. It was now clear that Bologna's rail station car park was where Europcar also had its own car park.\n\nBut the calvary wasn't over. I drove the car to the train station car park, went to level -1 (where, finally, a \"Europcar\" sign showed up) and parked.\nI had a look around, but there were no signs as to where to find the key drop box; there were no Europcar's desks anywhere. I walked to the top / ground floor, found a railways office, where a staff member of the national railways very kindly told me he believed the key box was on floor -1. He was not a Europcar staff, so he wasn't supposed to know this. I assume he knew as he had already come across tens of people who, like me, were looking for the same piece of information.\nI then went back to level -1, where I found two other people equally lost and looking for the drop box: someone else had told them that it was at level -2, not -1. I decided to believe the railways staff member (for the reasons above) and we started walking around on level -1. Finally, in a very remote, dark corner of the car park, partly hidden by other cars, there it was, Europcar's key drop box.\nIt was now 2:55pm; I was drenched in sweat, and had spent 45' of my time doing this.\n\nTo sum up:\n1. Europcar's office *never* answered any of my calls; I tried also later in the afternoon, repeatedly. This is simply a disgrace;\n2. The documents I was sent contained 2 different addresses where to return the car, both incorrect;\n3. Car conditions: some of the issues were not noted on the report I was given at car pick up;\n4. When I picked up the car, Europcar staff (Sig.ra Ilenia) did not clarify that the return car park happen to coincide with Bologna's main train station car park;\n5. Europcar's sign posting is abhorrent. A small sign next to the train station car park's entrance would have made this so much easier, as would some sign posting to the key drop box.\n\nOverall, I will never hire a car with Europcar again."

Then I got a follow up letter from their Collecting-Agents / Solicitors chasing payment of the Admin Fee. Again, I sent the correspondence to them and again Europcar assured me this was rescinded and they had corrected it in their systems. They obviously couldn't be bothered to actually do that. When I arrived at Heathrow (after a long flight) they said they could not provide a car to me because I was on the 'watchlist' for this very same 'outstanding invoice'. I realized exactly what the issue was, but the department I needed to talk to was closed for the weekend. When they opened a few days later, they confirmed they were in error & I should not have been denied rental - but it was way too late by then.\n\nAbsolutely appalling systemic incompetence on Europcars part."

This was UNTIL the rep realised we had purchased fully comprehensive insurance and that both husband and wife would be driving. The key was swiftly removed from us and we were handed keys to a Dacia Sandero. All I can say is that this car looked like it had been owned by a succession of learner drivers. There were scratches and dents everywhere and the car wasnt particularly clean inside. The tyres were barely legal and in a bad state for the dusty roads. Total deception on our side as we paid over £500 for this experience (and were parked next to the shiny new Peugeot we were meant to be picking up). Will not ever use this company again and will be watching the credit card carefully now following other reviews."

BUT if you are more than 1 hour late you forfeit your booking with no refund!

      "text": "I was told it's now IMPOSSIBLE to book a small car from Glasgow, unless you pay extra. I'm a Europcar regular - I'm looking at my online record and I see ten rentals in the last two and a bit years. These are private retals, spanning Portgal, France, Germany, Spain and the UK.\nI booked a Compact car ('Cupra Leon or similar' - that's a small hatchback. As on my last trip to Scotland, I was instead given a dreadful, wallowy, absolutely huge MG SUV. I asked for a smaller car at the desk, and was told I could have a BMW 1 series - for an extra £30 a day. I was told it's not possible to get the car I asked for without going premium - instead I had to put up with a bloated, rubbishy Chinese SUV.\nTo make things worse, the car stank of cigarettes - some previous user had been smoking in it. I complained before I drove away, and it was recorded (so I wouldn't have to pay for the damage - probably impossible to clean effectively) but I wasn't offered a change of vehicle.\nStill, at least there wasn't a queue. On two receent trips - to Toulouse in France in June, and to Portugal in April - I had to queue for more than an hour to collect the keys. There's no 'Privilege' desk any more for regular customers - no reward for customer loyalty, for filling out details in advance to speed things up. No, you queue with all the people who need every last comma on the contract explained to them, while staff try their hardest to up-sell. EVERY. STUPID. TIME.\nAnyway I'm getting utterly fed up with Europcar, I noted that queues at some other rental places are much shorter. I don't know if Hertz or Avis have a functioning loyalty programme but I might give them a try.\nI moved to the Europcar app after using brokers for years, after two unforunate experiences (with Greenmotion in Edinburgh, and Goldcar in Italy - the latter now ironically a Europcar brand) where I was ripped off for non-existent damage I didn't do. I have a global excess policy that I use everywhere from the US to Taiwan and Japan, as well as across Europe. But these two were the only times it's been triggered. To be fair, Europcar haven't ripped me off in this way. It's a credible brand. But customer service has not recovered from COVID and it seems it may well be time to move on."

So they charge me for 1 extra day, which is fair enough but what they didn’t tell at all until I confronted them about the extra 700 miles in charges! My booking was 6 days/ 1500 ml. This is 250 ml a day. Because I went over a few hours they change the mileage allowance to 90 per day which meant I was over 700 mos. Very deceiving. Never again I will hire from them. Also Bristol south not very nice people. In the end they charge me an extra 144£ for bringing the van a day later. Completely out of order!"

Took nearly £500 from me for a van hire, I returned it in perfect condition with a full tank (after spending £200 on fuel), signed off at the depot with no issues… and then out of nowhere, they try and slap me with a random charge for “extra mileage.”\n\nFunny how this supposed charge wasn’t mentioned when I handed the van back. Not a word at the time, but suddenly they’ve got the confidence to send robotic emails quoting “terms and conditions” after the fact, like that justifies daylight robbery.\n\nYou’re a multimillion-pound company chasing people for £60 like desperate vultures. No integrity. No transparency. Just jobsworth tactics and automated nonsense.\n\nAvoid Europcar unless you enjoy surprise charges, smug copy-paste replies, and having to argue over scraps after already paying through the nose. Total disgrace."

Our experience was extremely disappointing and felt intentionally misleading. Upon arrival, we were pressured into renting a larger car than we originally booked, with the agent quoting us a price that did not include VAT—a detail they conveniently failed to mention until after we agreed.\n\nTo make matters worse, we were charged an unexpected Station Fee that was never disclosed on the website or in our confirmation email. These hidden costs added up quickly and left us feeling scammed.\n\nThis kind of lack of transparency is unacceptable. We will not be using Europcar again and suggest others avoid them to save time, money, and frustration."

When I arrived at the Sheffield branch to collect the vehicle, I was told that the car I reserved was not available. Instead, they offered a Tesla and demanded an extra £30 per day for the upgrade during my 9-day rental.\n\nWhen I declined, they offered another vehicle for an additional £12 per day. Again, I refused, and they then claimed that no other vehicles were available and that I would need to wait 3–4 hours for a car to be returned.\n\nI had taken time off work and planned everything around this rental. After insisting firmly, they eventually gave me a car they had on-site — clearly proving that vehicles were available all along.\n\nThis company is clearly trying to upsell and exploit customers instead of honoring bookings. I had many options when booking, and I deeply regret choosing Europcar. They wasted over an hour of my time and caused unnecessary stress.\n\nIf the agreed vehicle is not available, you are supposed to upgrade the customer at no extra cost — not try to profit from the situation. This is unacceptable.\n\nAvoid Europcar, especially the Sheffield branch."

When we alerted the staff they brought out a booster seat for a 4 year old plus and before we could raise concerns the man literally ran off and we had to leave the car park due to other cars trying to leave and blocking up the car park.Them they said you agreed to pay the extra insurance which was flung on us at a busy desk with a queue of people in a foreign country!\nSo for our holiday for 8 days we had to drive with our daughter in a seat belt which is completely illegal and unsafe and restate the work unsafe !\nDue to this we didn’t drive 80 % of the holiday which we had planned to .\nAnd still when I rang up customer service about all this when home they just brushed off the safety of our child as we have no evidence of the car seat and there is nothing we could do…. Surely they had the 2 car seats in there depot so surely that would be evidence enough.\nThe fact that we paid money to Europacar pre booked our child seat and car and they didn’t have the safety equipment of the car seat to keep our child safe is outrageous.\nAnd then to be told we can not do anything about this is a sneaky and unsafe way to do business.\nI would like to see if I rented a car and child seat for one of their children and rush them out of the car park and see how they would feel.\nI would never use Europacar ever again unsafe unprofessional and sneaky aswell in the end .\nTake your money and provide an unsafe service disgusting."

Without going into all the details here, they basically accused me of lying. I wrote many emails of complaint but they still charged me £195 for a tyre. I had taken insurance with a different company because it was cheaper but honestly I have never known any company to have such little regard towards their customers. From start to finish with company, I would go as far to say that they are the worst company of any company I have ever experienced.\nThe dashboard said there was a low tyre as I was leaving the depot, so I had a quick look and judged that none looked low to the eye, and just thought I’d keep an eye on it and pump it up myself to get it to the correct level. According to them, I should have checked all the tyres for screws and nails before leaving. Are you serious? I drove home and left it on the drive over night. In the morning it was nearly completely flat. I drove to a petrol station to pump it up noticed a screw in the tyre. I called them and was told to take it back to the depot. I did this, and I was told to take to Kwik Fit. I was also told it would be free as it wasn’t my fault. The apparently have no recollection of this. Their customer service have been terribly rude, and condescending, and any emails I have sent have not been personable in any way. No apology for my bad experience due to their incompetencies."

I inadvertently drove into an area in London that is no longer accessible to non-residents, unless you’re a guest. No longer living in London I didn’t know this and received a penalty notice.\nI was surprised to receive it from Europcar week after my car was returned, but on realising it was my mistake I paid the notice and informed Europcar it had been settled. My complaint was that having paid the £65 fine promptly and thinking that was the end of the matter. Europcar then deducted another £45!! from my credit card to pay for their admin. I wrote to their customer services dept in case it was a mistake, as all they had to do was look up who was driving the car in question and send on an email informing them of the fine.\nIt would taken them 5-10 mins of their time to carry this out and for that they thought it was fair to charge £45 - which works out at an hourly rate of around £250-300p.h.\nWhen I pointed this out the customer services department were obstructive and extremely rude, repeating the same comment that’s it’s in the t&c’s I had signed on hiring the car.\nI tried to appeal against their argument but I kept receiving replies from the same 2 people who wouldn’t even listen to my point.\nI understand that they need to make a charge for admin but £45 - on top of a £65 penalty notice is really extreme.\nBut it’s their poor customer service and the way my complaint was dealt with …or should I say ignored, that means they have lost yet another previously loyal customer. I need to hire a car every 4-6 weeks so they have lost my custom along with a lot of other people from what I am now reading.\nSuch a shame they are so short-sighted.

      "text": "I booked a car with Europcar UK and successfully applied a discount coupon — I even have a screenshot showing the discount clearly applied and reflected in the final booking price.\n\nShockingly, upon returning the vehicle, the discount was quietly deducted from my deposit with no warning, no explanation, and in complete contradiction to what was shown at checkout.\n\nI reached out to customer service with full evidence (including a timestamped screenshot), only to be told “no coupon was applied” — a flat denial despite clear proof. Since then, I’ve sent follow-up emails and received no response whatsoever.\n\nAs a customer recently made redundant, I find this treatment not only financially unjust, but in breach of basic consumer rights.\n\nI am now escalating the matter to Trading Standards, the Financial Ombudsman, and leaving this review to warn others.\n\nIt’s outrageous for a large company to behave in such a dismissive and unethical manner. If you apply a discount with Europcar, they will just remove it. Avoid at all costs this company!!"

      "text": "Since the beginning of the rental, I have faced several problems with the vehicle. After going to the city of Porto (about half-an-hour from the airport) and parking the car, I realized that the doors did not lock with the remote control and that the car would not start. I contacted their helpline and was told that the vehicle would be towed and a taxi would be sent to take me to another Europcar counter.\n\nAbout an hour later, I arrived at the counter on Rua Gonçalo Cristóvão, where I had to wait another hour to be served due to the high number of people. I requested priority service, since the problem was Europcar's responsibility, but I was treated with indifference and a lack of professionalism by an employee, whose response was that I would have to wait the necessary time and that it was not her who caused the problem. I consider this attitude unacceptable and completely disrespectful.\n\nAfter finally delivering a second car to me, I continued on my journey. However, when I arrived at my destination, I realized, to my surprise, that the remote control of this new car did not lock the doors either. I was again forced to return to the same counter, where, after another wait, I was provided with a third car, without any apology.\n\nSince I picked up the first vehicle at 8:30 am, I spent about four hours without access to a working car, which means that I spent that time without enjoying the service I had already paid for. This lost time compromised important commitments that I had scheduled, namely a trip to the Citizens' Shop, which caused even more delays and inconvenience in the following days. All of this was made worse by the fact that I had been awake since 2am, having arrived in Porto at 7:30am on a flight.\n\nI have filed a claim 4 weeks ago and have received no reply yet. Very unprofessional"

      "text": "I wish to provide a candid warning to those contemplating the prospect of hiring from this company, particularly with regard to their Heathrow branch. This caution is underscored by a significant volume of negative reviews available online, and my experience is not isolated.\n\nDuring my interaction with the Heathrow location, I was subjected to charges exceeding £200, categorised as a Premium Station surcharge. This fee is levied despite the availability of other provincial alternatives within a reasonable taxi or cab fare of approximately £20. Furthermore, I was charged for Super Premium Personal Accident Cover, which is redundant as I possess my own comprehensive annual coverage with premiums totalling less than the cost of their two-week charge. Additionally, their breakdown cover was almost twice the cost of a standard RAC or AA annual policy for annual duration.\n\nRegrettably, I discovered these exorbitant charges only upon receipt of my invoice, as none of these fees were disclosed to me in advance. I strongly advise prospective customers to explore numerous online options for car hire excess cover provided by various insurers, which are available at a fraction of the costs imposed by this company. It is prudent to exercise caution; these charges are often hidden until after the transaction.\n\nMy attempts to rectify the situation were met with a lack of accountability. I engaged with a representative named Monica at a Spanish call centre, who assured me that the matter would be investigated. However, after a five-day interval, I was informed that no action had been taken, and I was told that Monica would face internal disciplinary measures.\n\nAlthough a decision was made to refund my charges, I was subsequently informed that the process would take five days due to the sum exceeding their operational limits, necessitating approval from the UK. This was further compounded by a call handler abruptly ending our conversation when I sought clarification, stating that they were restricted in the length of calls. Once approval was secured, I was told that an additional ten days would be required for the funds to reach my account.\n\nThis level of indifference displayed by their representatives is striking, particularly in light of how they would likely respond if the roles were reversed and they were in a similar predicament. My experience has been distressing, exacerbating my PTSD with multiple triggers stemming from their deceptive practices.\n\nI encourage anyone who has previously rented from this company to reassess their charges. Even years later, with the appropriate documentation, claims may be pursued in the County Court. To summarise:\n\n1. Avoid utilising the Heathrow location.\n2. Scrutinise all charges, regardless of the duration of your rental.\n3. Research supplementary services available from various providers online.\n4. Review competitor options thoroughly, paying particular attention to customer feedback.\n\nProtect yourself and make informed decisions."

As older French customers with limited English, we signed the rental agreement believing we were simply confirming the vehicle pick-up.\n\nHowever, Europcar added extra paid services (premium insurance and roadside assistance) without clearly explaining them, even though we had already purchased full insurance coverage via Expedia.\n\nDespite our complaints, Europcar refused any refund, relying solely on our signature and ignoring the language barrier and the context in which it was signed.\n\nThis was a very disappointing experience and, in our view, a clear abuse of vulnerability. We strongly advise non-English speakers or older travellers to avoid Europcar unless all documents are clearly translated and explained."

Why do they not do a credit check before accepting your booking and taking your payment. 3. They do not highlight that they do a credit check or get you to tick a box to give permission for the credit check. Had they done this, we could have booked under my wife as I had an issue with being scammed and a fraud identity which is still impacting credit score.\nThey left me stranded unable to get to a family funeral which could have been completely avoided.\nObviously do not care about customers at all!

Upon arriving at the rental desk, I was told that my reservation was \"blocked\" without any clear explanation, despite having a confirmed booking through Carflexi. I was then told I had no choice but to pay double the original price (for a new contract) for a different vehicle on the spot. Feeling pressured and stranded, I had no other choice than to comply.\n\nWhat followed was a series of deceitful and contradictory actions that made it clear this was not an isolated incident, but rather what felt like a systematic scam.\n\nThe agent handling my rental, someone named Sheikh, presented a false \"upgrade\" that I had never agreed to, and I was misled about what I was actually being charged for. It later turned out that I had been mistakenly identified as someone else with the same name, which Europcar themselves admitted in writing, confirming the error was entirely on their side.\n\nHowever, when I requested a refund for the extra charges caused by their own mistake, Europcar refused to accept any further responsibility. They effectively cut off communication and showed no willingness to resolve the issue, leaving me with no option but to escalate the case to the European Car Rental Conciliation Service (ECRCS).\n\nTo make matters worse, days after ECRCS confirmed I would be refunded £157 for the unjustified upgrade fee, Europcar attempted to charge my card an additional £142 without my consent. The only reason this unauthorized charge failed was because I had already transferred all remaining funds from that account, leaving no balance for them to take. I then had to urgently contact my bank and request the card be frozen to prevent any further attempts. This added yet more stress and time to an already exhausting situation.\n\nI have never in my life encountered a company that operates with such blatant disregard for honesty, accountability, and customer trust. I strongly urge others to avoid Europcar, especially at this location (London, Heathrow), unless you are prepared to be deceived, overcharged, and ignored when things go wrong."

In the past I haven’t added this cover and had no issues but this time the attendant was being really pushy and made me feel so uncomfortable that I added it anyway. He made very clear to me the only charges that will come out my account is the extra protection charge, the deposit, and the toll payer. I double checked with him because I already felt very ripped off paying over double what I booked the car at and he reassured me that was all the costs- nothing else would be taken from me. After I gave my car back I got an invoice with 2 extra charges that made the total 3 TIMES what I initially agreed on. My card was already set up from when I collected so they took the money. I emailed them a whole month ago and they refuse to get back to me to explain why I was lied to about costs.

The woman at the desk would not let us pay the holding fee via credit card, claiming that it wasn't working (It was working perfectly and is still working perfectly now) She then would not allow us to pay via phone using the credit card on the banking app. She claimed it was a problem with our card/bank It wasn't. She refused to let us try paying on a different terminal and put us in the position where we were forced to pay a non-refundable fee of £208 on debit card or cancel the hire losing the deposit in the process. We had two young children with us and a long journey to undertake so we had to pay. Unless this is resolved I will not ever use Europcar again and will encourage anyone and everyone that will listen that Europcar encourages immoral methods of obtaining payment. A total disgrace"

Just to be sure though, I phoned the customer service line when I was free a few hours later to report the half full tank. They said they'd log the issue and could I please email in my picture of the dashboard, which I did.\n\nI topped up the tank back to the half full level with 20 litres petrol before returning the car 2 days later having driven 221 miles (petrol hybrid). I mentioned to the agent on return about the fuel issue and naively thought that would be it sorted.\n\nHow wrong could I be - having been charged to refuel back to a full tank, I got in touch to remind Europcar about all the efforts I'd gone to inform them that I received the car half full. They have subsequently accused me of lying about this! Their attitude to customer service is just unbelievable...I've hired plenty times over the years, all of which they have on record, yet they assume that out of nowhere after being an honest customer for years, I suddenly want to get £50 fuel from them? I've sent pictures of the dashboard at time of pick-up and return that are time-stamped, clearly proving that I am right. I've sent a picture of the receipt showing I filled up with 20litres fuel - an ideal volume to have travelled 221 miles in a hybrid car! What more evidence do they need. They've lost me as a customer for life now because they've accused me of dishonesty. There are plenty of other hire companies I can choose from instead."

I was asked if I had used my card within the last half hour, which I hadn't and was then asked if I had made a payment of £1 to Europcar earlier. I was told that a payment of £2000+ had been made using my card and that it would seem it had been cloned. My money would be refunded and a new card issued but I needed to give more digits from my card. I realised this was a scam so hung up and contacted my bank. They were very concerned about the caller knowing about Europcar and asked me to contact Europcar which I did. I was assured that this matter would be investigated by their Fraud Department and that I would be kept informed - I haven't.\nAs far as the courtesy car is concerned it was delivered and collected a day late with little communication.\nAppalling."

We booked our rental through Auto Europe, unaware at the time that they act as a broker and that the actual rental would be fulfilled by Europcar. Had we known this in advance and read the reviews, we would never have gone ahead with the booking.\n\nUpon arriving at Verona Airport, we eventually located the Europcar desk, and that’s when everything began to go wrong. The staff member at the desk was very insistent that we purchase additional insurance, despite the fact that we had already bought full protection through Auto Europe. Even after I phoned Auto Europe and they confirmed we were fully covered, the staff member continued to push the insurance, making us feel pressured and uncomfortable.\n\nWhen we were finally given the keys, we discovered that the car provided was completely different from what we had booked. We had reserved a VW Tiguan or similar SUV specifically to fit our passengers and luggage, but were given a saloon instead. I returned to the desk, where I was told that SUVs and saloons fall into the same category. I contacted Auto Europe again, and after speaking with the Europcar desk staff, they informed me that nothing could be done as Europcar uses a different classification system than Auto Europe.\n\nEventually, a more suitable car was located, but we were told we’d have to wait 30 minutes while it was cleaned. In reality, we waited far longer — not an ideal start to a long-awaited holiday.\n\nThe car we were eventually given wasn't in the greatest condition, but at least it could accommodate both our group and our luggage and done the job. Still, the overall experience was disorganised, frustrating, and disappointing.\n\nWe left feeling exhausted before our trip had even begun. Based on our experience, I cannot recommend Europcar or Auto Europe and would urge others to think twice before booking."

Firstly the car was driven very carefully, parked in wide disabled places and kept in locked area and never left unattended. I believe the scratches were probably there before.

And when we raised the issue, Europcar HQ responded with a robotic, tone-deaf statement dismissing it entirely — citing a \"signed document\" as though it excused the behavior.\n\nWorse still, the Cardiff Europcar branch reviewed the situation and told us clearly: 'this would never happen under our watch.' So yes — the Stansted team is acting on its own agenda and damaging the Europcar brand in the process.\n\nThis was manipulative, unethical, and cowardly.

But, to my surprise I had to put 3 gallons in to replace (top up) what I had used as I was informed that the van had a full tank of fuel when I picked it up.\n\nSo, obviously the fuel tank wasn’t full when I picked the van up but I was told the tank was full and it should be returned with a full tank. I spoke with the branch manager at Chelmsford where I rented the van from and requested a refund for the 2 additional gallons of fuel that I had put in their van.\n\nThe million dollar question is… are they carrying out sharp practice to fleece their customers or is it some skullduggery from an employee, either way it’s not right.\n\nBe warned make a note of the mileage and the average mpg used whilst in your rental.\n\nI have twice been on their website to complain, filled in all the questions, written a lengthy complaint and when I pushed the upload button it defaults to “there is an issue with our webpage” handy so I am left writing this review to vent my frustration…\n\nI have tried to contact customer services again as requested in their reply below and it still says there is a technical issue and it sends you back to the start again. It’s now 4 times that I have tried this method….Like the company it isn’t working properly 😡"

The receiving agent spotted a scratch in the bonnet, that I hadn't seen at pick up, and had to squint in certain lights to see when she pointed it out. It could easily have been there when we picked up the car and I wouldn't have seen it. We rubbed the 'scratch' with a bit of water and a thumb and it appeared to be lifting, so I thought nothing more of it as I was convinced a polish would buff it out.\n\nWhen I returned back to England I got a bill for £320 to repair the 'damage'. I tried to challenge them, but got stock corporate responses demonstrating how little they cared.\n\nThey are cheap, but avoid as you will be ripped off if there is any hint of damage. I will never use them again.\n\nDespite getting the stock response from Europcar below and emailing them with details of my complaint, a month later and I'm still waiting for a response.

She repeatedly pressured me to accept unnecessary add-ons and even went so far as to suggest I’d likely end up in an accident for declining the additional insurance excess reduction. That kind of fearmongering is completely unacceptable. She asked the same intrusive questions multiple times — “How far are you going?” “When exactly are you bringing it back?” — in a tone that made me feel like I was begging to borrow her personal vehicle rather than paying to rent from a major company. The whole exchange was uncomfortable, condescending, and frankly, humiliating. At one point, I was so taken aback by her attitude, I genuinely considered walking away and telling her to keep the van. Renting a vehicle shouldn’t feel like being interrogated or talked down to. If this is how Europcar treats paying, polite customers — then count me out for good. I wouldn’t recommend this branch to anyone. Absolutely dreadful service."

I had booked a decent car, and they handed me a wreck – filthy, falling apart, and barely drivable. It looked like it belonged in a junkyard. An absolute disgrace.\n\nI had purchased full insurance coverage, so I wasn’t supposed to be charged for anything. Still, they held a deposit of £125, which was initially released, and then they took the money from my account after I had already left, with no explanation. That’s not a mistake – that’s outright theft.\n\nThis is not just poor service – it’s dishonest and unethical. Europcar in Tunis is running a scam. What they’re doing is not car rental, it’s abuse and legalized robbery.\n\nAvoid this company at all costs. I wouldn’t wish this experience on anyone."

We ended up paying €1000 for a basic 208 Peugeot which on their website was €300 when we initially paid for it. They also scammed us with €200 for a 3cm scuff on the wheel which was there before we rented the car, I showed the picture to them and the representative said I shouldn’t worry because it’s covered by the insurance (this was of course a lie) but they just need to record it for the next rental. They then also billed €87 for the damage admin fee. Be prepared to never see your deposit back and once you return the car if you don’t have a credit card then make sure you move the money from your account as they will just start charging random amounts to your debit card. Make sure you email all photos and videos and detailed description 1hr after you get the car as otherwise they won’t care what photos or videos you have. They lie, scam and steal and add secret charges that you didn’t ask for. We didn’t ask for roadside assistance and somehow it showed up on the invoice. There’s also a massive airport fee which they don’t tell you about in advance. Every price they say is without VAT, which they forget to mentioned. Do yourself a favour and find a local/family owned company outside of the airport and never go near Europcar as you will be robbed. Hopefully someone will eventually win a legal case against them."

      "text": "BUYER BEWARE if you are thinking about renting a car from Europcar.\nAfter reserving and paying for a car rental through a third party before leaving the United States, on arrival in Southampton I presented the 3rd party rental voucher to the Europcar agent who accepted it without comment. He told me, however, that the car I reserved was not available and I was offered an upgrade for £9 a day extra for the 14-day rental period. I accepted this and the agent made out a rental agreement reflecting the upcharge. At no time did the agent in Southampton tell me that the payment we made through the 3rd party would be disregarded and that Europcar would be re-billing the entire rental amount again. However, 4 days after returning the car, Europcar charged my credit card the full rental price plus the upgrade charge. In other words, I ended up paying for the car twice.\nAfter calling the company’s customer service three times and explaining the situation by email, my complaint fell on deaf ears. I was finally told that the voucher I presented in Southampton and that the agent accepted and kept without comment had not been applied.\nTo add insult to injury, upon returning the car at the exact time and date stated on the rental agreement (as confirmed by the agent who received the car), I was charged for an extra day after being told the car should have been returned an hour earlier.\nApart from being conned out of more than $500, the worst part of this experience has been trying to communicate with a company that is completely deaf to their customers concerns. The customer service rep., who is located somewhere overseas, will let you talk about your problem endlessly and then do nothing about it. Ask to speak to a supervisor: ‘sorry there are none’. I have to assume that using bait and switch tactics to justify ignoring payments from third parties is a common Europcar practice in order to avoid paying fees to those parties.\nSince we still needed an additional rental in the UK, we discovered Drivalia, which came highly recommended. It is understandable because their rates are half of what Europcar charges and their customer service reps are extremely friendly and accommodating.\nHopefully, my own experience with Europcar’s unethical business practices will serve as a caution to anyone in future looking to do business with an ethical car rental company.\n\nReview update: In response to Europcar's standard corporate response.\nWe had already contacted Europcar 4 times by phone and email, detailing the complaint. They have either not bothered responding at all or on one occasion were completely dismissive.\nThe attempt by Europcar to act like they care now is nothing more than a laughable PR stunt."

The other depots both said we should not have been charged more for the car and they hadn't heard of any luggage laws as told to us.\n1. We asked the guy in Edinburgh to try our luggage in the car we hired but he refused. He told us there were restrictions on putting luggage on the rear seat (a small carry on bag) He also told us the police were on the lookout for hire cars doing this on the North Coast 500, not knowing the laws we believed him. But I haven't seen any corroboration on the internet to say this is true.\n2. We went to Inverness to swap our car as instructed by Europcar's head office via email.\n3. Inverness advised us he had not heard from head office and advised us to keep going as smaller cars are like hens teeth. What did they expect us to do? We had already paid $1900aus and had pre booked accommodation.\n4. We only signed because we had to have something because we were booked ahead.\n5. At no time after we went to Inverness depot were we instructed to go back for a smaller car which we would have done. So why were we instructed to go to Inverness only to find no car available, and why weren't we told to come back the next day or at some other time...were we expected to walk around Scotland??\nAll of the above borders on a shonky deal and we have been trying to resolve this since April 24th....how long does it take.\nThe contract was signed after we assumed the story we were told was true but since found out it was dubious at best so....if you sign a contract under wrong assumptions it should be voided. Was the initial amount we paid not considered?\nThe car had lollies and other packets in the glove box...the guy in Edinburgh said we might have to fill up with Adblue which we had to do on the first fill of the tank....this should be done by Europcar not the customer...there was no manual in the car so we could not learn anything about how the controls worked. We would never recommend Europcar to anyone, quite the opposite especially when we have been fobbed off with the phrase \"but you signed the contract\" so even though we were told a story to get us into a bigger car which we didn't want and didn't order it doesn't matter to Europcar?\nWe booked a Citroen C3 or similar and we would have easily fit our luggage in that sized car. When we took the car back to Manchester Trafford Park the man who took delivery of the car was called Usama and he told us we should not have to put Adblue in the car as it's Europcar's job to do it...he said the guy in Edinburgh might have lied to get a bigger bonus...he said we would be reimbursed for the Adblue and the bond money both of which we are yet to see.\nThanks,\nPeter Brock"

The company have ignored my requests for any information on the insurance claim, only able to send invoices and debt collectors. It's been seven months since the driver knocked my door and admitted fault. They've given me no communication on the insurance and now im at a dead end where every department has told me they dont deal with this but also refuse to give me another department to try. I have even explained im happy to pay the money I just want to see some documentation on the insurance outcome as over one month after they confimed they hadn't started this process yet. I just want to know how to get reimbursement when the insurance claim goes through. Don't use this company if you like your sanity.... Absolute disgraceful service"

At approx 6.00pm the same day I received a phone call to inform me the car I had paid for was no longer available. I was asked if I wished to upgrade. I refused and asked for a full refund immediately. Despite the inconvience of having to sort another car rental our at such a late date the worst thing is I have still not received a refund despite phone calls and emails. Europcar were quick to take the money but 6 days for a refund seems a bit much! DO NOT USE this company."

I am currently \"in conversation\" with customer services about added extras I never ordered and I am looking for a refund. I never requested roadside assistance or personal protection but these were added to invoice. This is a scam where they make these additions part of your deposit. It is basically theft.\n\nCustomer services have now told me that cannot do anything as they were not part of verbal conservation at location - they have said that I should have been offered extras and asked to accept or decline which never happened.\n\nSo basically buyer should be aware of this practice and scrutinise what you are signing up for and make sure no extras have been added surreptitiously\n\nI would also beware of premium location surcharge that is added to costs.\nI certainly will not hire from them again."

      "text": "Edit 26 May: It is impossible to get hold of anyone on the phone or via email. It all looks professional but there is ZERO customer service. Do not go near this company.\n\nFor a 6 day hire my bill so far is gbp 400 plus deposit. I feel totally ripped off. I have not been able to drive the car because a tyre had 2 holes in it and no one was interested in resolving the problem. I have been stuck in one place waiting for repairs to be done. There was no spare tyre.\nI went through Rentalcar.com which is a broker. I was in a difficult situation and had to hire in a hurry for a next day, Saturday, start. I requested a Leeds city pick up and Manchester airport drop off on Thursday. I was charged 233gbp, then 85gbp extra when I went to pick up the car because the ‘different drop off location’ had ‘dropped off’. Plus a deposit which was ok and expected, if large. There was another extra charge for road usage when I picked up the vehicle. Prices are advertised in GBP but my UK credit card was charged in NZ dollars - I’m using an NZ mobile phone and drivers license but there was no obvious option to change the currency quoted/charged in. So then the insurance cover was added - the wording strongly suggests you need their full insurance offer. This was £65 for 6 days. Charging my UK credit card in NZ$ incurred four times unnecessary conversion fees. By now I’m committed and don’t have time (or energy because I’m dealing with a family emergency and really need a good reliable car, right now) to find another supplier so accepted the deal.\nI booked a 10am pick up. There was a 15’ wait before being able to begin completing the paperwork and pick up the car. The car itself is ungroomed in the interior, and didn’t drive well from the get go. Shortly after leaving the pick up point an alarm appeared saying ‘tyre pressure low’. I did not have time to deal with this immediately. When I called Europcar (the end supplier) two days later, by which time the wheel alignment feels obviously wrong, I waited a very long time for an answer and was eventually shunted through to someone who turned out to be the AA who came out to check the car through their breakdown service. Whilst the AA is always great, I could have called them on my own membership and saved the 30 minutes + waiting for Europcar to answer. So at this point I had no usable car (for which I’ve paid a very expensive total hire rate) and was stuck waiting for a roadside rescue service to help me out with ‘my’ problem. The AA turned up as promised an hour later, removed a nail ‘which has been in there a long time’, did a temporary fix so I could get to some local appointments early the next day (having by now not been able to get to that day’s necessary hospital visit and run other urgent medical-related errands), and booked a new tyre service Kwikfit who replaced the tyre the next day. They found another nail in the tyre and let slip that poor quality tyres on loaned-out vehicles are a common problem with Europcar vehicles. The worst part of this is that Europcar do not answer the phone and even when they do couldn’t give a damn. When I did eventually get through to a customer service agent she was smugly rude by just meeting my concerns with deliberate silence. She finally put me through to ‘the local branch’ (an ad loop telling lies about how great Europcar is) which clearly no one answers) where I was on hold over 30’ before I gave up. Worst customer experience ever. Will never use rentalcar.com or Europcar ever again."

The 'solution', after much wrangling was a drop off at our hotel, incurring huge drop off fees which they failed to tell us about, but they already had our credit card details, so they just took the money without telling us). The result was we payed over £300 for a 3 day hire, which we had NOT signed up for. I got a generic response to my review (that looked good on the review page) - 'we're so sorry etc, contact customer services on this phone number (didn't work) or this email (bounced back) or via our website (hooked into a loop that there is no response to). So I am admitting defeat and am going to sign it off as a really bad customer experience in which I was cheated by Europcar.\nBut as there is no option to respond to their 'helpful' response, I am leaving another review here. I'll probably get another 'we're so sorry etc' reply to this, but it goes nowhere, don't be fooled!\nI hate leaving bad reviews, but I am still feeling angry about this."

This staff, who is on duty, confirmed he could wait up to 30 minutes beyond the usual closing time – until 11:30 PM. We expressed our deep appreciation in phone.\nBefore making the car booking, we contacted your Customer Service team to clarify what would happen in the event of a flight delay, given that your office hours end at 11:00 PM. We were assured that, as long as we provided our flight number, your staff would monitor our arrival and wait for us accordingly. Based on this reassurance, we proceeded with the booking and submitted our flight information\nWe explained our situation and referenced the prior conversation with that staff. However, he remained adamant. When we requested an official policy document justifying this charge, he became defensive, accused us of being impolite, and refused to provide any documentation. He then stated that unless we paid the fee, he would close the office and WITHOUHOLD the car.\nAdding to our discomfort, before demanding the late fee, this staff spent over five minutes trying to upsell us additional insurance. We informed him that we had already purchased full coverage. He replied confidently—but misleadingly—that full coverage did not include wheels and tires, and pressured us to purchase more coverage. When we declined, his attitude changed abruptly, and he immediately brought up the “After Hours” charge.\nLastly, when we arrived at 11:04 PM, the staff member had just finished completing the documentation for the previous customer. He was not simply waiting in the office for serving us.\nI fully agree that flight delay was not Europcar’s fault and was not their responsible for this either.\nHowever, they did not keep promise and still charged us after failing to sell us insurance, simply because we were only 4 minutes late.\nThey not only refused to issue a refund, but also failed to provide any documentation justifying the 'late charge' as per their Terms and Conditions\nPlease think carefully before ordering a car from them, even if their initial prices seem cheaper."

It took about 40 days to fix my car so during this time I did about 2,000 miles. When finally my car was ready, I was told that I can leave the rental at the repair garage, as this was apparently, the usual practice. It took Europcar 3 days to collect their car and I received the collection report with all the images, which looked okay. I've been driving for more than 40 years, dozens of different rental cars around the world, never had a damage. I did not suspect any problems with the rental car, as usual.\nWhat was my surprise when a month later I got a message from Europcar stating there was damage to the rental car worth nearly a £1,000! There was no visible damage to the car while in my possession and I am not aware of anything like that! The images presented were magnified x20, making minor scuffs and scratches look massive. The car was not at the place where I left it, and was also cleaned. There was no mention in the contract that 2mm scuffs will be considered a damage worth £1,000!\nI feel so sorry I accepted their service as they are clearly after ripping off their customers. The car was not even repaired, it was rented again to other people, and the damage claimed is barely noticeable. They took advantage of me as I was so stressed by the accident I had. Europcar made me sign documents I was not in a proper state to thoroughly read, made me agree to a huge excess (£1,000, no coincidence?), they even claimed a damage described in their paperwork upon vehicle delivery.\nI would strongly recommend - DO NOT use Europcar! They would only try to rip you off as much as they can! I wish I never had to use their lousy service and will, most definitely, avoid Europcar from now on. Europcar is an absolute disgrace!"

Otherwise they will try to take you for all you’re worth.\n\nThat’s without even mentioning the lack of care, they are supposed to come out and show you the car’s features, how to use it, etc.\nMine was an EV which I had never used before, he just gave me the keys and sent me on my way.\n\nOverall extremely negative experience."

I was also told they were offering a \"deal\" on an upgrade to an automatic - they told me the *upgrade* was an extra £100/day usually but that they'd reduced it to £40 as an offer. Not only am I fairly sure this was a lie (it's not £100/per day more online), the *per day* part was said very quietly. Then they gave me an automatic anyway! A few weeks later I got an admin fee of £45. I believe it easily cost more than double what Avis would have charged (I have used them before and they were honest and transparent and I highly recommend them). This felt like a scam.

So I read through the paperwork and found they had put all these upgrades and charges on top of my original booking without my consent! So I called up customer services to complain and they also informed me that I had also been charged for fuel top up even though I had filled it up at a fuel station less than half a mile away from I had to drop the vehicle back to … very dishonest company and staff"

      "text": "We had booked a 9-seater Mercedes van on line for a short holiday in Spain. Arrived at Malaga Airport on 5th April. We thought it would be quick service to get our vehicle. Were made to wait an unreasonable amount of time while the staff struggled to locate a Mercedes vehicle. After some delay, the customer service agent remarked, “At last, I’ve found the Mercedes van for you,” and then immediately pushed a rental agreement towards me for signature.\nThis document listed more than half a dozen scratches, broken parts, and damages — yet none of this was explained or reviewed with me in any way. Most of the text appeared to be in Spanish, with only a few vague English notes.\nAfter waiting for over 30 minutes at the desk, we were handed the keys and told to collect the vehicle from level -2 of the car park. Not only was this an inconvenient distance from the desk, but the underground storage was extremely poorly lit — making it nearly impossible to conduct a proper inspection of the car.\n\nWe were told to report any additional damage within 24 hours or risk being held liable for anything not listed. Due to the lighting conditions, we were unable to thoroughly inspect the vehicle. We drove it out and parked at a nearby shopping centre, where we finally had a chance to properly look over it. What we discovered was shocking: the vehicle had over two dozen scratches on the bodywork and extensive internal damage, including loose parts that rattled loudly during the short drive. It was very clear that this vehicle was not roadworthy and should never have been released for rental.\nHave already complained (22966365). No explanation has been provided in response to my formal complaint, which I find unacceptable. This response lacks the seriousness the matter deserves and reflects poorly on how Europcar treats its customers.\nDon't rent a car through Europcar at Malaga airport. Their cars are parked too far underground, and you cannot inspect the vehicle because of poor lighting. Avis or other cars are parked at a reasonable distance. The message is clear - AVOID Europcar. They only want your money by even putting your life at risk"

Not received my money as well. The lack of transparency and poor customer service were extremely frustrating. I do not plan to rent from Europcar again and would not recommend them to others."

I am currently trying to retrieve over £1100 that Europcar took out of my account on a saturday morning without any authorisation and having never had a hire car from them. I tried to get a hire the previous month for work for 30 days. I entered everything for them and paid in full before going to collect the car from Manchester airport. When I got there the very aggressive and uninterested staff informed me that they were going to do a credit check on my address. I was not worried as I own my own house lived there for years and don't do credit or debt. The guy comes back and refuses me the car hire. I'm like hang on this can't be right. Also why was this check not done before I'd paid my money. The staff refused to help me I any way and would not allow me to speak to a more senior member of staff. There message to me was go somewhere else you are not getting anything from us today. I was left standing there having giving up the day to collect the car in the first place. I was informed that it would take 20 days to get my money back. Europcar held my money in their account making interest for days before I eventually got it back. No car and no money for 10 days. I launched an investigation to find out why my address had an issue only to find out that the poorly educated and extremely rude member of staff had entered next doors address. I feel he did it on purpose. These guys were a real bad bunch at Manchester Airport Branch. On the 28th April for no reason Europcar took from my account the money again. I have still nor had it back. There is no one to complain to at Europcar there is no real customer service to speak off. These accessed my personal data withdraw money from my account and have held onto it. I have had to register it as a theft with he police I've had to buy a vehicle in order to start my new job at the cost of £8000 taxed and insured lost days in work as a result of it. I don't think I've ever been so badly treated by a company in my life. I actually thought that this type of behaviour by a company was not possible in this day and age but it is. Don't be fooled by this company with the green t-shirt and little euro logo this guys are scam artists and should not be trading at all. I will be bring to the whole thing to trading standards and data protection etc. I never take the time to write reviews but I am writing this to try and save others from being scared like I was. Please stay away from these guys especially at the Manchester Airport branch."

We had never hired a vehicle before & could almost see ££s signs in the rep's eyes when he asked us. My husband did ask if the car we had booked had a Sat Nav system (Ford Focus or similar booked via Booking.com) & were told that only new electric cars had these. He then went into back office & bought out 2 sets of keys for a Hyundai Kona & a Volvo car - no sign of our original request!! After being bombarded with insurance information & other additional charges told that the insurance already taken out with Booking.com was useless, so told to take out their additional insurance - even charged more for the One-Way charge than anticipated - altogether had to pay an additional £400 for a car we didn't request or need!!! We weren't even shown to the car or shown around the vehicle to check for any damage & it was getting dark by the time we finished with the reams of paperwork. We didn't even know how to start the car initially & had to figure out how to operate the Sat Nav ourselves! The final figure on the Rental Agreement was deducted from my husband's bank account but then adjusted after leaving the Desk. All in all - a totally traumatic experience, which was unexpected & we left shell-shocked. I think the staff are trained to confuse customers into signing up for additional services that they do not want or need. I think that they make customers feel cheap & uneducated if they question the explanation for additional services. I wouldn't recommend this company to my worst enemy. I contacted Booking.com with these details and think they are aware of their practices as they refunded the insurance that I took with them without any questions & advised that the deposit (which we didn't know would be deducted either) would be returned within 28 days but not much else. PLEASE DO NOT HIRE VEHICLES FROM THEM - we will never ever use them."

Europcar 'customer services' clearly exist as a barrier to refuse customer refunds and prevent case resolution.

I paid nearly £80 for the pleasure, along with a £100 deposit and £36 insurance upgrade. The collection process was simple and straight forward, and the bloke who helped me was nice. However, I was told I would need to leave the van in a nearby carpark when I was done with it, as there was no where else to leave it out of hours, but that it would be picked up at 1pm on the Sunday (the following day). Fair enough, although it would have been useful to know this upon booking. I dropped the van off 3 hours before my rental period ended at 7pm on the Saturday, and paid for the parking until the next day (as advised by the staff member) for 12 hours at nearly £8. I received a return statement and invoice on the Monday to say that I was being charged an additional £114.45 as I didn’t hand the car back until the Monday! I contacted customer via phone and email, and sent proof of my drop off, the carpark receipt and all additional info I had to and they essentially fobbed me off and told me it was my fault and that I had indeed dropped the car off on the Monday. They explicitly said I had been charged correctly. They then stopped replying to my emails. I phoned the branch where I hired the van from and they accepted that they had wrongly charged me BUT it took almost 4 weeks to get my money back, and in total I spoke to 6 different people who were useless at helping me. I kept being told ‘it should be with you soon, call back in 2 days’. Overall, a horrific service and unless you push and press them, they are reluctant to accept fault and refund you. I didn’t get one apology during this experience. DO NOT USE THEM."

I will try once again but have no issues of getting a reply or solution from Europcar.\n\n---\n\nI booked the car through Easyjet and (in short) this happened at the Europacar desk in Gatwick:\n\n- When picking up the car the person behind the desk tried to upsell. She had 2 keys, one of the MG which would be our car and another key of a car which would have navigation and heated seats. Normally for 100 pound extra, but now only for 40. We declined this and the MG had navigation and heated seats anyway. Seems like very dodgy practice.\n\n- I had to sign a document, I asked what is was for,, the person said I was signing for the car not having any damage. She even joked it felt like “siding your life away”. The car didn’t have any damage but it seems she lied about what I was signing.\n\n- After that I had to swipe my card. I asked if this was for the deposit. She said, yes this is for deposit, this again seems like a blatend lie as my creditcard was charged anyway after returning the car.\n\nGetting a reply from the client service department is a real nightmare. I have send about 6 e-mails (one every week) to get a reply of 2 sentences by someone who clearly didn't care to read buy e-mails or check my case. Renting with Europcar has been an absolute disaster and I wil never do so again.\n\nI have bookked many cars with other rental companies all around the world and I never had any problems.

      "text": "ok, I knew this is a waste of time, but I called customer service again, and I talked to Leo (Ipad) again. What are the odds?\nAt least this time he was honest and told me that there's nothing I can do and they reached out to me on trust pilot just so they look that they are trying.\nBig surprise there...\nWow, this company is rotten to the core.\n\nOn April 10th we flew to Heathrow, and we took a shuttle to Europcar to pick up the car we already paid for online.\nThe guy at the desk started to push a free upgrade, a Mercedes GLE SUV. I said I don’t want it because it is an expensive car, but he insisted, saying that the car is not new and has scratches.\nEventually we agreed and he said there’s a deposit of 284 GBP that will be refunded when we return the car.\nThat’s when he realized that my wife’s driver’s license is expired, but because he was eager to scam us he finished the papers making her the main driver which should be not only against their policies but also illegal. Of course she didn’t drive at all, I was doing all the driving.\nI signed the papers and then he said that because it is a free upgrade a manager will have to sign.\nThe manager came and he signed then we left. What I didn’t realize was that the manage added a 4 in front of 284 making it 4284 GBP.\nAlso, we didn’t realize until later that they didn’t take any deposit from the visa (for the obvious reasons).\n\nWhen we returned the car, we noticed the amount on the back, and we asked to speak to the manager (a different one).\nHe was right in front of us, but we had to wait about 20 minutes because he was trying to push an upgrade to a family.\nEventually we talked to him and he said that it is our fault for signing and he pretty much called me stupid.\nWe tried to lock the Visa, but it was too late.\n\nWe returned to Canada and immediately called Europcar customer Service and talked to Agostina.\nI explained the situation including the expired license. She gave us a case number and said she will e-mail us with a resolution.\nAfter couple of hours we got and e-mail for her saying that our request was respectfully denied.\nI called again and talked to Leo. I explained to him the situation again, stressing the fact that the contract should be void because\nit was issued knowing that the main driver’s license is expired. He agreed and said that maybe Agostina overlooked that aspect.\nHe gave me a new case number and said he will e-mail us within a day.\nThe next day we got the e-mail, and he respectfully denied the refund saying “even in the case Mrs Bogatan would not have a\nValid driving license she would remain the legal hirer as it is her who signed the agreement and paid”. That is incorrect\nbecause it was me who signed and paid the agreement.\n\nAt no point in our conversation Leo or Agostina seemed surprised that someone would spend 4284 GBP on an upgrade\nfor a rental that costed about 350 GBP which makes it obvious that everybody there is part of a big happy bunch f scammers that is Europcar.\nWe checked online and there is an overwhelming number of negative reviews, lots of them describing situations similar to ours.\nI guess I should consider myself lucky for not damaging the car, because apparently that is Europcar’s main way to overcharge customers.\n\nThe question is how can big company like this openly rob so may customers without any actions from the authorities?\n\nDan Bogatan"

I have just had money taken out of my account almost 2 months after the hire for an undisclosed reason , my communications and phone calls resulted in them basically telling me it’s not their problem and for me to deal with it so Europcar are saying it’s not Europcars problem you need to speak to Europcar.

We ordered a car online and when we arrived the car wasn't available which is standard but what I wasn't made aware of was the replacement car was an upgrade that I'd have to pay for. The agent didn't make me aware of the extra cost and got me to sign everything with no explanation and I felt under pressure to do so. Its as if the agents have a target and are paid commission to up sale. Pity I didn't read the reviews before booking this company, hopefully someone reads this and doesn't make the same mistake and goes with some other car hire company!"

I waited in all afternoon but no-one turned up, there was no phonecall or communication to advise that they weren't coming or running late. Just before 6pm I called to check if they were coming. The gentleman I spoke to, refused to help me and said that I would need to call the branch. I then called the branch - they were closed! I then called back and spoke to an extremely rude and abusive lady. She refused to help me, refused to put me through to a manager, kept talking over me and hung up when I asked for her name. Her attitude, lack of customer care and rudeness has left me extremely upset. I cannot understand how someone with her attitude and unkindness can work in customer service."

      "text": "I hired a large van to move some items all in all around 30miles. I needed it on a Saturday and this was the only company with availability. I booked it on the Thursday beforehand. Booked the van from 10:00am-22:00pm on Saturday and was charged £71.45 which I thought was fairly reasonable. Noticed when booking that a charge would be added after as I would be returning the van out of hours. I called Europcar to ask how much this charge would be and was told £20. I asked for this info to be emailed to me in case they tried to charge more later. They said they couldn't provide this info in writing which made me nervous but I needed to go ahead with the booking. The next day (Friday) I had a phone call from them saying that the van I had booked was not available but they could offer me a smaller one. I declined as had to move a sofa. They said it was OK and they would make sure the van was available for my booking the next day. Saturday we arrived at Europcar at 10am but there was nowhere to park at all - it was a tiny site with cars/vans everywhere. I ended up dropping off my partner and parking at the shop down the street. He was waiting for about 15 minutes till he got served and was told the van wasn't ready. He had already checked in online but they wanted all of his details again. Clearly they needed to waste time as the van wasn't ready. They asked for the payment card so I had to go back and provide this, they made a comment to my partner saying something along the lines of 'we will cancel this whole thing off until she gets here and then start again' - my partner said 'no that is not necessary she is parked 30 seconds away - keep it on the screen she will be here now'. I arrived and they took all of my details and tried to sell me insurance. I said that the basic will be fine as we are travelling very local. They proceeded to try and scaremonger me into taking the insurance but I said no. At this point it was about 11am and they were cleaning the van. I said that I want a discount as the van wasn't ready 1 hour after my booking time. They said as a gesture of goodwill that I could have the van until the following day. I said this is no use to me, I am doing 1 trip - I want you to waive the £20 key drop-off out of hours fee and they said they would 'try'. So far, I haven't been charged this but wouldn't be surprised if it comes out of my account in the next few days. Would not recommend at all. Problem at every stage. Should have read reviews before booking. Even if you're in dire need I would go elsewhere."

Approached the counter, asked if there were any issues and was assured by James that this isn't a problem - that there won't be any additional charges for the early pick up, and the original reservation will hold (i.e. able to return at the original time without incurring any late fees as well).\n\nI had added on the fuel option and was told that there'd be a hold on my card for excess fees, which will be returned. Went through the contract quickly, and James only pointed out the additional fuel option and got me to sign. BIG MISTAKE. I should've noticed that the contract now showed an additional day's rental charged at a ridiculously high rate, along with associated fees.\n\nFor context, my original booking was a compact sedan over 3 days, and the spot rate charged for what was essentially a 45-minute early pick up was £100 (40% of my initial cost). Might I add that due to the hard selling, we only received the key to the car 20 minutes before the original pick up time.\n\nAfter returning the car, I wasn't provided a statement of return nor a final invoice, despite them responding to confirm that it would be sent over in the next 10-20 minutes. When I saw the absurd charges to my card a few days later, Europcar representatives informed me that the dispute was filed, but again, they never got back with a case number and went radio silent after.\n\nDespite 2 follow-up emails, sharing the intention to file for a chargeback based on fraud, Europcar refused to respond. Filed for a dispute with my bank, took months and multiple emails before I finally got my money back.\n\nSave your time and wallet, pay the extra and go with more reputable car rental firms in Bristol."

We paid for a LUTON van to move house, a week before they phoned to say it wasn’t available and we’d need to downsize but that the capacity was similar. Begrudgingly we said yes. They then phone to say we need to repay for the hire of that van?! Despite already having 170£ for the original hire (assured this will be refunded within 10 days), we then pay out AGAIN for a second van. You guessed it the day before completion they phoned to say we don’t have that van now, unless we want to wait until 5pm?! Erm no. So we downsize yet again to what can only be described as a large car, we refuse to pay again but are then asked to pay a whopping deposit despite them already having 2x van payments from us. The customer service was beyond shocking, people have the communication skills of a wet lettuce, and that’s putting it nicely. You ask at the desk and are met with blank faces and “we don’t know how to do that”. Honestly shocking from start to finish and 300£ lighter."

Sure enough searching the car make and cracked windscreen shows other drivers had this problem. Despite there being no impact damage, no surrounding scratches etc just a clean crack they are insisting its damage not a defect. They are asking for £900. I did take out insurance elsewhere but they wont cover manufacturing defects. Complete lack of care from them means I wont be using them in the future."

Before booking the car I was assured by two Europcar employees what the price was and was promised that the extra number on the paper was my deposit that I would get back. They then took the extra money out of my account and when I raised this with Customer Care they said they would speak to the Park Royal branch I rented the car from, but they never did - just fobbed me off with an email saying the case was being dismissed. I then had to go back to the branch and speak to them in person. It took 3 months of my life to finally get the money back only to then receive an email from Europcar's lawyers fining me for not paying a bill that I had in fact already paid. They also charged me for a full tank of petrol when I returned the car despite the fact that I returned it full. It seems that Europcar took money from me at every chance they had. If I hadn't spent the time sorting this I would be several hundreds of pounds out of pocket. This has caused me so much stress! What a nightmare company to deal with."

The staff at the car return looked over the car and didn't raise any issue. I then received a damage notification followed by a £100 bill for a 'light scuff' on one wheel, (which wasn't caused by me). I was shown no proof that this was not there before my rental and as much as I did check the car for dents/scrapes on the doors, bumpers etc (Bearing in mind it was dark at almost 11pm at night when I collected the car), I did not get down on my hands and knees with a torch to check the car tyres, if I had done I would have seen that this 'light scuff' was already there. At the time of returning the car I signed the tablet with no mention of any damage by staff even after they had walked around and inspected the car.\nI contacted customer services and was simply told that 'any damage needed to have been reported before hand'.

I asked the desk colleague to investigate who said there was nothing he could do as it was a uk issue. I then had to hire a different car which wasn’t fit for purpose from another company, I needed a truck one way from Nelson to Queenstown as was moving Items.I then had to stay up till it was 9am back in the uk (10pm nz time) to sort out myself, jet lagged as hell. You then admitted it was your mistake and I could now go and pick up the truck, I drove back 2 hours to the airport to swap the cars. I’d had to pay for a full weeks hire of the car I didn’t need and the other car company wouldn’t refund me, I’d need to obtain a refund from Europcar for the £700 I was now out of pocket. I then sent an email to the relevant department after speaking to one of your call centres and you replied saying I’m still blocklisted and you can’t issue a refund! I then have tried calling 4 times to your call centres (in India not the UK) who when I ask to speak to a manger to escalate have hung up on me 4 times. I’ve never experienced such poor customer service. All I wanted initially was my refund for the car I had to hire because of your ineptitude, however I will now be taking you to small claims court and claiming for the car, my time, and the stress you have caused me, along with the interest on the money you owe me. DO NOT hire from this company, they are absolutely useless, the departments don’t speak to each other and no one in any department has the authority to make a decision when something goes wrong, I suspect the staff don’t get paid well enough to care about their jobs or to provide any worthwhile level of service.

So they transfer me back to customer services who explain to me that when you book via the website and even though you receive 2 emails confirming your booking, it doesn't mean that the booking is actually confirmied. It is just noting what you would like. All they can suggest is that I try to book a van from another location. I suggest that if there is a van at another location, it could be delivered to Tamworth for tomorrow. Apparently that can't be done. They did offer to cancel my booking free of charge but that doesn't help me with my need for a medium size van in 20 hours time.\nIn the end they suggest that I ring Tamworth and ask them to sort it out, which obviously Tamworth can't do because otherwise they wouldn't have rung me in the first place.\nUPDATE\nAs readers can see I got a response from Europcar some time between 5-6.00pm so I followed their instructions and tried to email them with further information.

During the hire, the car developed a tyre issue and we had to wait a long time for it to be repaired, leaving us unable to use the vehicle for a period of time.\n\nWe also spent far too long on the phone to customer service, who gave different information and weren’t particularly helpful throughout.\n\nAt the end of the month-long hire, we were charged £201 for a valet – due to dust, gravel in the footwells (it was winter). The rest of the car was spotless, and even one of their own advisors agreed the charge seemed excessive. To top it off, it took 4 months for them to tell us the price they wanted to charge.\n\nI’ve used plenty of other car hire companies without issue – this was by far the most frustrating experience. I won’t be using Europcar ever again."

He then keeps you focussed on one part of the contract while getting your signatures on the other parts. This cost me hundreds of pounds. I was cheated but the lesson is to make sure they explain every cost and every aspect of the contract even if there is a queue behind you. Don’t let them rush you. I turned around when leaving to see the Agent high fiving their Manager. So they are very brazen about ripping off customers. I formally complained about the actions of the Agent, accepting it was my fault not to check everything. But the attitude of Complaints matched the attitude of the Agent."

I recently went to Gatwick Airport to hire a car for the weekend, and the price of £408 for just two days has completely turned me off from this company for life. This experience has become a topic of conversation among my colleagues, friends, and family. I'm sorry, Europcar, but your time in the market is up; this situation is outrageous!\n\nIt seems like either the employees are making money on the side for their personal gain, or the company is poorly managed. Their advertisement claims that you can hire a car from £40 per day, but when I inquired, they were quoting me £200 per day instead! This feels like false advertising, and they are clearly breaking laws left and right.\n\nAdvisory is if they mess up the best thing is to open a complaint and conduct an ADR process, wait for their final response, and then to Financial Ombudsman Services, which is a free service. Once you have a ruling in your favor, this is the key for charges to be added. One colleague was ready to sue this firm for £8,000 when initially Europcar only owed £2,500 for falsely extorting monies for their personal gain, which is fraud under the 2006 Act. They had to pay very quickly; otherwise, their stock of cars would go to auction with more costs to them! And then see them in court with your decision from the FOS and then send in bailiffs to collect your debt! Easy way but will take time. Theur customer services are incompetent to deal with complaints so court is the best action."

This third party admitted responsibility and I filed a damage report following Europcars instructions. They had all the details of the driver causing the damage and I assumed that was the end of the issue. However, sometime later I received a claim for payment of the damage from Europcar. I explained the situation but they had no record of my damage report. The alarm bells should have started ringing then. I had to pay the 850 pounds damages, while they claimed the money from the driver responsible and I have still not been refunded some 8 months later. I have been passed from department to department, emailing on average once a month to try and resolve the issue. The driver that caused the damage has told me his insurance company case number and as far as he is concerned the matter is closed and his insurance has paid, but I have not received any money. I will continue to email Europcar, but I am wondering if I will ever get my money back. The only thing I am sure of, is that I will definitely think twice before renting with them again!\n\nGuess what? I contacted customer services and according to them the case was closed!! I have been instructed to email them again. Feel like I am banging my head against a brick wall!!!"

On Monday 24th March I received a phone call from europcar asking for a deposit and then told me a car would be delivered that evening between 4-5pm, at 6pm I phoned them to ask where it was to be told that it would be delivered the following day between 10-11am (therefore we had to travel via a taxi to and from my daughters day service which is 100mile round trip per day) anyway I went with my daughter in the taxi to drop her off to her day service then I was dropped home to await the car being delivered. 12pm came so I phoned them to ask if it was still being delivered and was told that the time had been pushed to 1pm and someone should have phoned me to let me know (I didn’t receive a call) I then waited till 2pm and still no car, I once again phoned them to ask where the car was because if it wasn’t going to arrive in time I would need to get another taxi so I could collect my daughter, I also asked to make a formal complaint because I had been told several different days and times and they hadn’t stuck to their agreement nor contacted me with any updates. I phoned back again half an hour later to ask if a complaint had been logged and I was told the previous person had spoken hadn’t put anything in the system. I asked again to file a complaint (which I’m not sure if they have or not) the car eventually arrived at 16:45 (24hrs later after the original planned time) there were no apologies or explanations given. It seems that there’s a miscommunication issue between (Europcar motability and Europcar Maidstone. I had already had a stressful day on Monday when the brand new (three months old) electric car came to a halt and the Electric Traction battery failed, leaving myself and my disabled daughter sitting at the side of the road for five hours awaiting RAC and tow truck (8 hour before car was recovered) so I really didn’t need their stress on top of it all"

At no point when I was sorting the new tyre did they say I was liable for a slow puncture and they have been totally unreasonable. They refused to complete a fault check on the car to show when the tyre pressure fault was initially recorded on the car and seem to think that a slow puncture would be obvious within 24 hours. If you ever are in the unfortunate position of having to deal with this awful company then accept they will screw you over and send you a bill for £180 for one tyre. I did the right thing and got the tyre changed even though I could easily have just pumped it up and handed it back to them and then they would have had to sort it which is what they did to me. No common sense and a an absolute rip off. Also told that this is classed as insurance claim, I hope the useless complaints person is wrong about this as it is totally ridiculous.

Europcar operate a 'scam' service.\nI was flying from Australia to London Heathrow and decided to hire a car from Europcar during the Doha lay over. I selected the car to be picked up at the airport, filled in all the necessary and selected to pay upfront. The process went through up to my bank where it came back with 'there was an error with your bank' (Scam 1)\n\nI found this odd as there were no issues. I tried a different credit card in case - same response. I tried calling Europcar, no answer. I decided to back myself up by selecting a 2nd rental from SIXT but to pay at the airport. Within seconds I received a SIXT confirmation of booking.\n\nWe arrived at Heathrow on Sunday 23rd March at around 5pm and decided to first go to Europcar as we had in the interim received an email stating 'YOUR CAR IS WAITING FOR YOU' (SCAM 2), and we had made a payment and if it had gone through whilst we were in flight, we didn't want to pay twice.\nBut we couldn't find Europcar. We asked SIXT desk and they said it is a shuttle SERVICE (Scam3). We went back to where the shuttle was supposed to be with 2 trolleys of suitcases. No signage. Went to ask again and told it is lane 3. Pushed the trolleys to lane 3 only to find it was not there. Asked again and directed me back to the first point. We waited 20m for a shuttle and a 20m drive to the EUROPCAR satellite office where there was another wait to be served of 15m. By this time it was now 8pm. I got to the front desk eventually, pulled up my email and the Europcar agent says 'you didn't finish your booking?'. I said I did and showed him the email stating 'your car is waiting'. He said that the booking was not confirmed, and the error message showed that. I asked why if the car wasn't available didn't they show this online and how was a customer to know that an error message for payment meant the vehicle wasn't available? He responded with that he could do the booking manually but there would be a price difference (Scam4). On the app it showed a 30GBP difference between online and at airport booking. We were tired and frustrated so said ok to the difference if it was small. We had booked an Electric JEEP for the week at a cost of 284GBP. The guy came back and said it was now 722GBP. I told him that was unacceptable. He said that due to the fire, all cars were booked out and no other rental company would have a car. It was now nearing 9pm, we had to be at a hotel 2hours drive from Heathrow and I think this is Europcar's plan (Scam 5). We refused to pay the price which was almost 3x that of the original booking and seeing we were not buying this scam, he said he could give a discount and we could get it for 520 GBP. The online at airport booking was 309GBP so he was trying his luck with the higher amounts. We refused and asked them to take us back to the airport.\nOn arrival I went directly to the SIXT desk, was helped by a fantastic and knowledgeable lady and within 10m we had the car which we had selected, at the price we selected. Europcar you could learn a lot from SIXT.\nWe are frequent travellers and will NEVER RENT FROM EUROPCAR again as they deliberately show cars online that they use to lure customers and then when the travellers are tired take advantage and try to scam by tripling the cost of the vehicle. You should be ashamed of yourself Europcar."

I was then told I could only rent a small corsa like car though I had booked for a compact (slightly bigger) and when I asked if that would be deducted from the price I paid she responded “no it remains the same price”…. Slightly bizarre seeing as it’s two different sizes. I accepted as I was already at my wits end. 5 minutes passed and I was told that they would not be able to rent to me due to not passing a credit check….. surely the check should happen at the time of booking or even if that’s too difficult how about at the online check in stage which I had done already.\n\nThese conglomerates think they can do what they please to individual customers with no repercussions but believe me I am going to shout on every possible rooftop about this diabolical experience."

The total rental amount was £91.00, and an additional £50.00 was paid for waiver protection. (Supporting details attached.)\n\nInitial Interaction at Rental Counter\nUpon arrival to collect the car, the representative at the counter inquired whether I had rented with Europcar previously. I informed them that I had, but had a negative experience regarding fuel charges, despite refueling the car minutes before returning it. I was forced to raise a complaint and provide proof of my fuel purchase in order to receive a refund. The representative apologized and offered me a free upgrade for my current rental.\n\nRental Agreement and Holding Deposit\nI was presented with the rental agreement, which clearly indicated the prepaid amount of £91.00, as well as an additional charge of £86.90, which was explained to me as a holding deposit. I questioned this charge, and it was reaffirmed as a holding deposit, which would be refunded to my card upon the return of the vehicle. This conversation was witnessed by my colleague, who was traveling with me at the time.\n\nFuel Refill and Return of Vehicle\nPrior to returning the vehicle, I refueled the car with 6.91 liters of petrol, totalling £9.66, at the nearest garage to the airport (PA3 2TH), as per the attached receipt. Upon returning the vehicle, I handed the keys to a Europcar representative named Jack, who inspected the vehicle, including its mileage and fuel levels. He confirmed that everything was in order and that no issues were present.\n\nUnjust Charges\nOn March 21, 2025, I received an invoice for additional charges, including a Premium Station Surcharge and a charge for 6 liters of fuel. Furthermore, my credit card has been charged an additional £98.85 on top of the original rental charge of £91.00.\n\nThese charges are clearly erroneous, unjustified, and appear to be fraudulent.\n\nI hereby request that the excess charge of £98.85 be refunded immediately to my credit card.\n\nAdditionally, I wish to file a formal complaint against both the employee who processed my rental and the representative to whom I returned the vehicle. Their actions were misleading and resulted in fraudulent charges being placed against me.\n\nI expect prompt resolution of this matter. Should this issue remain unresolved, I will be forced to take further action to protect my interests."

I returned it a few hours later having done 42 miles and having filled the tank up to the very brim with £8 of fuel just before drop off. I couldn’t get any more fuel in the tank. They hold £250 from your account to cover any additional costs. Just got my money back but with £10 deducted for fuel! If true this car used £18 of fuel to cover 42 miles. This is a SCAM. I made the guy at the Europcar check the car over with me which was a bit of a walk. The guy was very unhappy, wanting me just to leave the car for him to check later, but came with me. He checked the car inside and out (checking mileage and fuel) and told me everything was OK and that I’d get my full deposit back ‘soon’. When you leave a hire car you are at the mercy of the integrity of these hire companies. Europcar clearly has little of that. I made a complaint and will include the result of that later. However it might be something like:\n\n“Hello John,\nWe appreciate your feedback and we are sorry to learn you were dissatisfied with our service.\nGive us the chance to solve the issue by providing more details using (link removed) where our customer service team will be in touch.\nWe hope to see you again.\nThe Europcar Team”\n…or something like that….."

Upon return they tried to charge me £16 50 for fuel luckily I kept my receipts and took a pic of the dashboard with a full tank which had the date and time and they refunded me . The car STANK of smoke to the point where I drove it twice for the whole week as my kids were complaining of the smell and I had to keep windows open as a result I did call and complain about this. Then to make the 4 day experience even worse they then tried to tell me I damaged the wheel ! Again luckily using my iniative i took pictures before and after hire . These people must be seriously hard up for money as they will try to take anything they can. DO NOT USE THEIR SERVICE save yourself the stress"

      "text": "13th March 15.35 received email confirmation of car hire from 17th-21st March pick up/drop off Kinston upon Thames.\n14th March 13.05 received call from mobile 07815 464792 to inform me that the Kingston branch would not be operational w/c 17th March therefore pickup and drop off needed to change to another depot. It was agreed reluctantly on my part that new pickup/drop off station would be Gatwick South Terminal which is 30 miles from where i live. I was assured by the female caller that this modification would not alter the t&c's of the hire contract including the cost.\n14th March 13.12 , the modification email came through which still stayed pickup and drop off Kingston upon Thames.\n17th March 08.04, i rang europcar customer services to again ask for reassurance that this booking had indeed been modified correctly. I was assured that despite the modified booking stating Kingston upon Thames, the team at Gatwick would see this change on their system.\n17th March 11.30 ,i embark on 2 and half hour journey on public transport at my own time and cost to travel to Gatwick.\n17th March approx 14 00, approach service desk, i am.told there is no booking. Customer service agent calls over manager who also looked perplexed and repeated no such booking. I insist and relay the information provided by Kingston. After 5 mins of phone calls and deliberation Customer service agent, tells me that i have 3 different options of car, each costing £30+ per day additional to what i had already paid. I declined having been completely misinformed by Europcar and was told only alternative was a refund. I went outside and immediately called Europcar customer services who passed me back and forth and eventually to complaints. They refused to acknowledge their error and when i asked them to resolve the matter as they were at fault i was told that i would have to make a new reservation at a new cost £200+, but that i would have to wait at gatwick another 3 hours as their system did not allow immediate booking and vehicle retrieval. I have now travelled 30 miles from home on buses and trains to be told a) booking not valid b) i would have to pay another £120+ c) if i want new reservation i would have to wait 3 hours.\nUNACCEPTABLE\nWhile this has been now registered as a complaint and assures an investigation, i insist on satisfactory answers to the following:\nWhy was Kingston upon Thames showing as open and operational on Gatwick system which initially impeded the gatwick staff from seeing the booking?\nWhy, when a customer has already been subjected to a 30 mile trip instead of a 20 min bus ride to their chosen and confirmed place of pick up and drop off, at their own inconvenience, time and money, does Europcar not accept their own internal failures and endeavour to resolve the problem?\n\nI will also be submitting a claim for compensation to cover travel expenses to the airport and the additional cost of hiring a vehicle with another provider who were extremely helpful in overcoming the ridiculous bureaucracy around 2/3 hour wait times for a vehicle when they had one available and ready to go. Needless to say i will not be using Europcar ever again.\nI would appreciate a swift and satisfactory response addressing the abysmal customer service illustrated above\n\nBlanket response from Europcar which failed to address the specific failings of the booking.\n\n\"Thank you for contacting Europcar Customer Services regarding the vehicle not provided for your reservation 1187068944.\n\nFirstly, I would like to sincerely apologise for the lack of provision of the confirmed vehicle. On occasion, unforeseen changes to our fleet utilisation, resulting from extensions or breakdown can result in the Rental station responsible for your hire being unable to fulfil the booking.\n\nI would like to sincerely apologise for any inconvenience that may have been caused, and would like to assure you we constantly review ways to improve our services and minimise any disruption to our customers.\n\nI trust this information assists with your query.\n\nRegards,\n\n\n\nDavid\"\n\nEuropcar UK Group | Customer Services"

Even when I questioned the girl about the extra £409 she said she didn’t know how much the rental was but there was a refundable deposit.\nAfter returning the car £409 was taken from my bank account with no warning and it appears the £78 on my original booking was none existent thank to the added extras I was not told about.\nWhen I rang to complain they laughed at me.\nA very poor service and left me feeling I’d\nbeen scammed.\nI wish I had read the other reviews for Europcar as I would have seen so many other people have experienced the same situation. Do not use this company if you can help it!"

The mileage on the vehicle increased after it was picked up, yet they ignored my concerns and insisted on charging me unfairly.

Myself and my partner rented a vehicle and mid-way through the trip, when we finally opened one of the back doors, a handle just came off and stayed in my hand. The inside of the door handle was also visibly covered in glue (guessing done by the previous renter), but I would have no way to prove this. We returned the car immediately to the dealership and the agent (which knew us as this point) have assured us that we would not be held liable and that they will report it as damage caused in the previous rental period. Well, in a few months time we got invoiced for the repair of the damage, which we were advised to dispute by the same agent and once again assured that all they have to do is report it as \"damage from the previous rental\". We have emailed and called Europcar customer service to notify we are officially disputing the claims that we have caused the damage. We have got no response after that for months and assumed that maybe it was resolved. However, recently were contacted by Shakespeare Martineau, which is Europcar's legal representation, who have claimed since we neither disputed the claim nor did we pay the funds, we are now threatened by court proceedings and additional charges.\n\nIt is extremely sad and disheartening how the company viciously deceives and manipulates their clients to cover unjust fees. We will probably end up paying a large sums of money for repairs of damage we never caused."

On returning the car, the car hire people told me that there were two scratches on the door and bumper and the total repair cost would be Euro 2100. The excess payable is limited to Euro975, but the car hire people say that this excess is per scratch, making it possible that you would end up paying more than the car is worth. This seems utterly bizarre. No one in Europcar seems to understand how quoting for work works, let alone their own insurance policies. This position is not resolved and is ongoing."

Their business is built on hidden fees, poor service, and poorly damage claims process.\n• Damage Claims – Their damage claims department is the worst process on earth don’t sign anything and avoid. If somehow you have damage on the ie tyre damage due to a pothole they charge you an extortionate amount of money. Been disputing since January and now is the time they want to open things up again, when you want information from them they get quiet but anything to do with them and money they are loud. they ignored my dispute and charged me a ridiculous amount.\n• Rude & Unhelpful Customer Service – If you try to challenge their charges, good luck. Their customer service team either ignores you or keeps passing you from one department to another with no resolution.\n• Unclear Pricing & Hidden Fees – They lure you in with what looks like a good deal, only to hit you with unexpected charges later.\n\nAvoid Europcar at all costs! If you don’t want to waste time and money. stay far away from this company!"

I clearly stated FIVE times that I did not want the premium cover, yet they added it anyway without my consent.\n\nThe agent, Fred, even lied to my face, telling me the extra charge was just the rental deposit—when in reality, it was the premium cover I had rejected. Later, he even called me for feedback, completely unaware that he had charged me for the cover! This proves that Europcar is either incompetent or deliberately deceiving customers to steal their money.\n\nWhen I complained, Europcar’s customer service dismissed my case, simply stating that I had signed the contract—completely ignoring the fact that I was misled and scammed into doing so. This is outright fraud.\n\nI will be reporting Europcar to UK Trading Standards, disputing the charge with my credit card provider, and will continue leaving reviews until this issue is resolved. Avoid Europcar at all costs unless you want to be scammed!"

      "text": "I had an extremely frustrating experience with Europcar UK due to unjust charges and a lack of accountability.\n\nFirst, I was charged over £100 for roadside assistance, which was never properly explained at the rental desk as a daily fee instead of a one-time charge. Had this been made clear, I would have declined or opted for full insurance, which would have been a far better choice. Instead, I was rushed into signing multiple documents without any real explanation.\n\nEven worse, I was charged over £200 for a faulty tyre that developed a bubble after just 215 miles over 8 days—something that shouldn’t happen with a properly maintained vehicle. This raises serious concerns about Europcar’s safety standards. It seems that Europcar relies on renters purchasing insurance to cover defective or substandard parts, knowing they can shift the cost to insurance companies rather than ensuring vehicles are well-maintained. Those who decline extra coverage are left footing the bill for Europcar’s own negligence.\n\nHoping for fair treatment, I escalated this to BVRLA, expecting them to step in. But rather than questioning Europcar’s practice of shifting costs onto customers, BVRLA chose to focus only on Europcar’s paperwork, avoiding any real attempt to hold them accountable. This approach allows Europcar to continue misleading and overcharging customers without consequences.\n\nRenters deserve better—clear terms, properly maintained vehicles, and fair business practices. Not hidden charges, misleading explanations, and financial penalties for defects that aren’t their fault."

Photos were provided, but I am unable to see any damage in the photos. I have attached a photo they sent, apparently there is a scratch on the front bumper but I do not see one, especially at the resolution provided. Not to mentioning claiming \"damage\" on a bumper - a bumper! - just screams scam.\n\nI was not asked to inspect the vehicle prior to the rental. I was not given any evidence of the condition of the car prior to the rental. (However, the pickup attendant tried to upsell me to cars that were 8x and 6x more expensive than my rental.)\n\nUpon return (to London City), the attendant required me to drive to a remote part of the parking lot for the return - far from the Europcar office and designated return area, with no other cars around, and extremely far from the terminal. I now know why - to be out of view in order to execute a damages claim scam.\n\nThe car was only driven 4 times during the rental, and did not impact anything during those 4 trips.\n\nClaiming that I am responsible for damages is scam-like, inefficient, inappropriate, and terrible customer service. When I stated so to the claims rep, they claimed I should've read the 49-page Terms and Conditions prior to the rental.\n\nHighly advise renting elsewhere."

I had to use my debit card instead of a credit card as the PIN had been changed by my wife. Apparently using my debit card meant that I had to take compulsory and very expensive CD insurance that increased the cost by 112 euros. This was not exp[lained to me at the desk. On return I was invoiced for this extra amount and emailed their support. This was answered that I had signed the agreement when renting so nothing could be done. My point is that I cannot read the full agreements when renting a car especially when stressed to get to my final destination and with a queue behind me. I had bought a policy to cover the excess so clearly did not want or need extra insurance. I think that Europcar should have refunded this charge but they stopped replying to my follow up emails.

However this was in desperation to correct a very justifiable grievance, that had failed at branch level and also Customer services at corporate office. So here goes..\nI had ordered and paid for a manual Intermediate sized SUV. I received an Automatic COMPACT SUV. Europcar's argument is they are MONETARY the same value, so a clear downsize is OK, even if it was NOT discussed, or even mentioned with me at the counter, when collecting my vehicle. In fairness I should have noticed when I got my vehicle, but it was parked next a large Merc SUV so just thought it looked small. My vehicle was a Hyundai Bayon, a very small and questionable SUV of any sort. I had to get to Portsmouth to pick up a disabled family friend and was already late(flight) so headed off. We just managed to get her mobility scooter in the boot but had to use the back seat for her walking frame, mine and her suitcases plus a backpack. Dangerous and also risking damaging the seats. These important facts have been totally overlooked by Europcar, who keep trotting out the same line about \"Monetary\" values of both vehicles were the same. Presumably for my 5 day Intermediate SUV, they could have given me a Luxury car for 2 days or Tiny car for 8 days, because it's the same Monetary value - extreme but the same logic. I never expected the CEO to deal with it, but delegate to an area/district manager who can have rung me and got my side. A request for an area/district managers contact details was made, but again ignored. This incident happened over 2 months ago but wanted to give ample time for someone to act, which is only fair.

I had to wait for the new car as it was just having a puncture repair, the AMG locking wheel nuts where evident in the car on eventual entry. We dropped the car off and two weeks later, I received an additional invoice for 380 GBP for some light scratches on the underside of the nearside, rear wheel arch. It was impossible to make a scratch in this position UNLESS this was originally caused when changing the oversized AMG wheels. First and last time with this company. Awful."

      "text": "Follow-Up on Recent Rental Experience – Hidden Fees and Unfair Charges\n\nDear Europcar Team,\n\nThank you for responding to my initial review. While I stand by my praise for Peter’s outstanding customer service at Heathrow, I feel it’s necessary to share the full picture of my experience — not just for your awareness but also as a warning to future customers.\n\nAfter reviewing my bill, I discovered numerous hidden fees that were never clearly explained. I was offered an upgrade that I was told would cost an additional £20, but I was later charged £150. Worse still, I was asked to sign documents under pressure and wasn’t given a copy, leaving me unaware of the full charges until it was too late.\n\nThis lack of transparency and the feeling of being misled has completely overshadowed the initial positive experience. It’s deeply disappointing, especially during what was already a difficult time for me.\n\nUnfortunately, due to this experience, I will not be using Europcar again and strongly advise others to be extremely cautious when reviewing their rental agreements and charges.\n\nI hope you take this feedback seriously and address these issues to prevent similar situations for future customers.\n\nBest regards,\nOwen\n\n(My original review below)\n\nOutstanding Service from Peter at Europcar Heathrow\n\nI recently visited Europcar at Heathrow on the morning of Friday, 21st, to collect a car for a difficult journey to a close relative’s funeral. Understandably, I wasn’t in the best of spirits, but the exceptional service I received from Peter truly made a difference.\n\nFrom the moment I arrived, Peter’s warm demeanor and positive energy were evident. He went above and beyond to assist me, showing genuine care and professionalism throughout the process. His kindness and willingness to help lifted my spirits more than he probably realizes.\n\nIt’s rare to come across someone who not only excels in their role but also impacts customers on a personal level during tough times. Thanks to Peter, a stressful day became a little easier.\n\nI am deeply grateful for his support and will definitely be returning to Europcar in the future because of this experience. Thank you, Peter!"

Despite clearly stating FIVE times that I did NOT want the premium cover and only needed the basic rental, I was still charged for it.\n\nWhen I noticed the extra charge, I contacted customer service, expecting them to fix their mistake. Instead, I was met with zero accountability and refusal to refund. This is not just bad service—it’s deceptive and feels like a deliberate upsell scam.\n\nLoyal customers deserve honesty and transparency, but Europcar has shown neither.

The rental process was smooth, and I returned the vehicle in perfect condition, with no damage whatsoever. Europcar even refunded my deposit, confirming there were no issues at the time of return.\n\nHowever, 18 days later, I received an email claiming that I had caused a 5-15 cm scuff on the front bumper. This accusation is completely false. I drove carefully, parked safely, and at no point was the bumper exposed to any situation that could have caused such damage.\n\nI immediately disputed the claim and requested proof, including time-stamped photos and inspection reports. So far, Europcar has not provided clear evidence that the damage occurred while the vehicle was in my possession. Given the time delay, I strongly suspect the damage happened after my rental and that Europcar is unfairly holding me responsible.\n\nThis experience has been frustrating, and I now see many similar complaints from other customers. It feels like a deliberate scam to extract extra money from customers long after their rental has ended. Beware! Always take detailed photos and videos before and after your rental to protect yourself.\n\nI would strongly advise against renting from Europcar unless you want to risk being charged for damages you didn’t cause."

I booked a car for my family trip from 20th December 2024 to 20th January 2025 and paid in full (GBP 1,639.81) upfront. However, the problems began as soon as I arrived at the Gatwick Airport North Terminal after a 30-hour flight from Brisbane.\n\nDespite explicitly informing the staff that I did not require additional insurance because I have Allianz Travel Insurance covering rental car excess, I was handed a document to sign under the pretense of providing a security deposit. Later, I discovered it was a completely new rental agreement with added charges for unwanted insurance and a so-called \"free upgrade\" to a Peugeot PG5008. The upgrade was presented as complimentary because the originally booked MG HS was unavailable, yet I was later charged for it.\n\nUpon returning the car at Heathrow Airport, I was unexpectedly charged GBP 20 for cleaning without prior disclosure. The staff claimed it was because the car floor required more than five minutes to clean. This charge was never mentioned in the rental agreement.\n\nAfter returning to Australia, I discovered an unauthorized charge of AUD 3,889.19 on my credit card, labeled as a second rental payment. I immediately contacted Europcar but received only an automated response. Despite multiple follow-ups, I was given no proper explanation or resolution.\n\nTo make matters worse, I noticed additional unexplained charges of GBP 45 each on 12th and 13th February 2025. Again, these charges were processed without my consent and with no justification provided.\n\nThis experience has highlighted Europcar's lack of transparency, misleading practices, and poor customer service. I strongly advise others to avoid Europcar if they want a stress-free and honest rental experience."

Not only this but they told me they would need to downgrade my car type as the original wasn’t available. Which I can only imagine would have meant that if I’d made the original booking, they wouldn’t have had the car category I’d ordered and paid for anyway. Completely unhelpful and rude on the phone. This is just blatant profiteering at the expense of customers.\n\nUPDATE\nContacted them as advised below and got back a confused and nonsensical answer - pasted below.

      "text": "We hired a car for 7 days, and while hiring the car they were very friendly, but on our last day when we were heading back to the airport the car wouldn’t start. We tried ringing and it took ages to get through but when we told them what happened they said we had to ring the AA. We explained we were heading to the airport and didn’t have much time to waste but he just said I can’t help. You have to ring the AA if they can’t start it they will organise a pick up and you can follow them to the nearest Europcar centre and they will give you another car. We explained we had a 1 1/2 hour drive and by this time needed to be at the airport in less than 2 hours but he just kept saying I can’t do anything else. We then called the AA who said it could be up to an hour before someone could get to us. Obviously we couldn’t wait around for that. Luckily we were staying close ish to the airport with our cousins the night before so we didn’t have such a long drive that morning. They said they would wait for the AA and we had to book a taxi to take us to heathrow. Luckily the traffic wasn’t to bad and we got there just in time. As we were boarding the plane we had a message from our cousins to say the AA had been unable to fix the car and were just then picking it up to take to the euro car centre. Had we not taken the taxi we would have definatly missed our flight. We contacted the customer services centre multiple times after this and they IF they answered my emails it was not with an apology, I was told in the first response to upload the receipt for the taxi and they would pay it back. I complained about the lack of help and the fact we couldn’t use it that last day so that should be reimbursed to but they just said they had closed the case and could do no more. They then sent us an email to say they would reimburse the full mount and take out the full mount minus the cost of the taxi…. But that the reimbursement could take up to a month for international transactions. Without checking first with us they had taken a further £2080 out on our card leaving us then with over £4300 on our credit card while we awaited the payment to eventually go back in. I emailed 4 times after that money was taken out against our credit card without permission… I asked to speak to a manager each time. I never had any responses from those last emails. I am outraged and disgusted by the lack of support from Europcars, I will never use them again and I am going to write this warning on every social media site I can find."

When finally get through their horrendous phone systems which switch you off and tell you to call back later after sitting for an hour - they say they will be delivering a car on day expected but 5pm - in the dark which means no opportunity to check vehicle, then on morning of delivery told definitely happening but can’t confirm car (booked electric suv) after midday call to say can’t deliver - basically I live in small rural town over hour away from them so of course they don’t want to deliver! I can travel and get though… the title motability customer gives clue in title - I cannot collect, get a taxi (few taxi firms will lose a cab for 2/3 hours on a Friday pm when they have school contacts to honour)… this is 3rd time they have failed with their obligations, apparently I can trust them to deliver when I’m not around to sign for it… if these guys cannot even undertake basic customer service skills or basic project management (can’t guarantee your booking for day booked maybe up to 3 days)… or in my case even with 2 weeks notice on booking they don’t source a car in time or deliver as promised… they made me feel completely worthless.. my car cannot get mended as I cannot be without a car!"

After returning the vehicle I noticed on my invoice that an extra charge of amount £223.04 has been applied to my bank account (in the name of 'Premium protection'). I never asked to add any additional service on top of the booking amount of £ 327.35 which was paid already at the time of booking (before even using the rental service). If I need any additional services, I always make sure that everything is in place and paid for to avoid any surprises and to keep a track of by expense and budget.\nI clearly mentioned \"NO\" multiple times for any additional services to Europe car rental agent (It must be recorded on their camera).\nEven when I said \"NO\" multiple times to any kind of additional services, Europcar's agent printed 'Premium protection agreement' papers without informing me and put in front of me to get my signature with other many agreement documents which is really deceiving and manipulating the valuable customer and forcing unnecessary extra charges to the customers while they are trusting the process. When I explained the situation to them and asked for refund, they denied. Never ever going to book from them. I request you all to avoid such shameless deceivers instead of getting deceived."

This company operates like a scam – sneaky fees, dishonesty, and zero accountability. DO NOT RENT FROM EUROPCAR! 🚫\n\nEdit to Europcar's response:\n@Europcar UK, your response is disingenuous.

I always take photos of the car, looking for dents or scratches etc. Have never thought to check rear wiper to make sure rubber blade is there, will from now on. Did the right thing and reported it when took car back, within 24 hours of realising it was missing. Initially all seemed ok, security deposit was returned. 3 and a half weeks later notified us we would be held responsible as it was 'new damage'. Not only did we then get invoiced for the rear wiper arm also, that was not damaged to our knowledge, was in working order, that is how we realised there was no rubber blade. Still in the dispute process and my friend's account used for the security has had a withdrawal for the full invoice without our knowledge it was about to occur. Will never use Europcar and neither will any of our family or friends. We will be sure to let our travel agent know so she doesn't use them either, it was her booking for us."

Why do they do that? Because customers are given the opportunity to rate customer service at the end of each call if the call end normally - by cutting people off, or by leaving them stranded on hold for nearly an hour so they customer has to put the phone down, the nasty, rude employees don't get poor ratings (and presumably keep their jobs).\n\nWhile I was trying to sort out the horrendous problems in branch, another customer came in, with a walking stick, an elderly man, who was promised someone would deliver his hire car in the morning. When nothing arrived he told me he spent hours and hours trying to call the branch but all calls are routed to Morocco or Bulgaria who refused to put him through. A pensioner, he had no option other than to pay for an emergency taxi at 5pm to the branch to find out why he didn't have a hire care. This is what you will deal with if you use Europcar.\n\nPut them out of business... always leave an honest review, or take them to the small claims court if you can. Never, ever, EVER use Europcar."

I paid for an Audi Q5 but when I arrived they offered me some Alfa Romeo instead which is lower than the class I paid for. After about 30 minutes of driving the yellow check engine light comes on. Complete my journey and try to call them but their office is closed.\n\nThe next day (today) at 8:30am I call customer service who put me through to breakdown who then then put me through to the RAC. Waiting a few hours for them and then get a missed call from them but my phone never rang.\n\nCalled back Europcar and again got transferred. This time they said they would “deal with it themselves”. Shortly after this I receive a call from the AA. Meet the mechanic and on diagnosis of the issue he tells me the engine light is on because the car is overdue a service! He also advises me to contact europcar and forward on the report. He was a gentleman and very courteous and helpful. I must say.\nI spend the rest of the day trying to talk to someone who can help. The worst interaction was with a Vladimir. He said that he couldn’t transfer me to Gatwick even though his colleague managed to an hour before. “But did they pick up?” he asked. No. They didn’t. “So see, I can’t transfer because they never answer the phone.”\nI asked to talk to a supervisor. “I’m not allowed to transfer you to a supervisor”\nHe then said he would send an email to Gatwick and they would reply shortly. His colleague had already sent an email on my behalf several hours previous. I asked him if “shortly” meant by the end of the day but he wouldn’t promise. My interaction with the europcar web of entanglement lasted until 3pm and then the offices were closed.\n\nAll day I spent on my foreign mobile racking up charges. I didn’t use the car. It’s not the car I wanted. It is overdue a service so I wonder is it even roadworthy…. Did the right thing but they refused to help or engage.\n\nI rented the car for 3 days to visit a relative who is ill with cancer. I just wanted a hassle free experience. Instead it was a nightmare. Terrible company. Never again.\n\nI shouldn’t have to pay for the day I spent fighting for them to help and not driving thr car. I shouldn’t have to fight for help. Their system appears to be designed to prevent you from getting through to anyone who can help. The first customer service agent should have taken ownership of my problem to begin with.\nMaybe tomorrow I will get a call. All I want to advice on what to do? I’m not sure the car is even roadworthy."

I was using Europcar branch at the London City Airport and rented Fiat 500 on December 18th 2024 for two days. Had no accidents, returned the car safely, only to be told I've made a damage to the front windscreen. A tiny two dots, visible only from close. I'm 100% sure they were there already, but they weren't documented. I did took pictures of the car on the day I've got it, but the problem is that the pictures taken were from the few steps away and although you can see something is there, but if you zoom in, the picture becomes blurry and the damage is not exactly visible. It's so small (like 1mm), you can barely see it from close. So now they've froze my 500£ deposit ant investigating the matter. Investigation is already going for more than a month, no indication when it might end.\nBut even if it did happen, maybe without me noticing, the damage is so minor, you could literally find 50 more scratches this size throughout the vehicle. I mean, it wasn't a new car, to look at a dot and say you'll need what, to replace the screen? And what is there to investigate for a month and ongoing? I'm a single mother working two jobs to survive, these 500£ are very important for me, but the the company doesn't care.\nAlso, I would like to point out the extreme rudeness of the Europcar employee who examined the car upon it's return. She noticed the damage straight away (as if she new where to look) and was acting aggressively towards me. Didn't allow me to take the picture of the tag with her name on it and did not write her name on the Statement of Return report she wrote. Unfortunately, I don't remember her name now, at the moment we spoke I felt under stress, in part because how aggressively she spoke.\nI will forever regret the day I chose Europcar."

Little tricks, such as demanding that I wrote personal details on a post it, that were already on the booking form, conduct DVLA checks [that i had never been asked to do in the past] fill in paperwork with details already given, and change the booked vehicle for a completely different vehicle, which ended up further as a completely different vehicle once in the lot collecting it [he gave us a Skoda, which clearly was our 'punishment' for daring to challenge him! -I'm pleased to report that the Skoda was excellent, and I enjoyed using it!!!]\n\nIt was all rather surprising. I've been hiring vehicles fairly frequently for over 30 years, and Europcar was even our contractor at a couple of firms where I have worked, and we never had any issues.\nI have filled out countless booking forms, had my license inspected [which is clean and long standing] and never had a claim on a hire ever.\n\nPerhaps one of their bods will see this, and finally deign to respond to this very annoyed customer one day..."

I never found out until one week later when I received an email from europcar with the claim against me for 2 scratches on the car.

At the end of the rental period The Europcar charged my card the extra $1050. I contacted Samuel at customer service to say there must be a mistake and could he please check the audio and video so that he could see there was no mention of extra cost for the upgrade. He responded by saying that I had signed the paperwork but did not mention anything about the video or audio footage. I asked him again to consult the footage, but again he did not respond. I asked nicely for his manager or supervisor's contact details but he did not do this either saying that the matter was now closed.\n\nIf Eurocar had done the right thing, I would use them again and I would be telling other people about the great service I had received.

Will never trust Europcar again, They messed up by renting me a car which they didn't have, their communication was non-existent (if they needed to cancel my booking at short notice someone should have at least rung me to confirm I had got the message) and the customer services were unable/unwilling to help me even though I explained the significant inconvenience they had caused me. Suggest using any other car hire company than these as surely the others don't treat their customers this badly?\n\nUPDATE: Following Europcar's response asking me to 'give them chance to resolve the issue', I have just received a standard response saying they didn't have an available cars and I will be refunded and to accept their apologies. Nothing about their appalling level of customer care, no acknowledgement of the huge inconvenience caused, no gesture of goodwill.

We booked a car online (medium sized) via Booking.com\nWhen we arrived (jet lagged & exhausted after the long flight from Australia), the guy said that the car we had booked wouldn't serve our purposes as we were doing a lot of driving. As per another review, you're a target because you're tired and you just want to get a car and get going.\nLong story short: we ended being \"upgraded\" (supposedly at some discounted cost), but out of pocket an extra GBP1400!! In hindsight, my husband made the observation that when we were talking to the guy about our booking, he had 3 sets of keys in front of him. We figure (in hindsight), that one set was the car we actually booked, the second was a slight upgrade and the third was the set for suckers like us. And, like another reviewer, the upsell about insurance: no, what we had paid for online was not of any use, blah, blah. Then, when we finally get out to the car and ask for some help with how it all operates , they send out some young guy who knew little more than us. We got absolutely NO help working out how to get the GPS to work - when you put in an intended address, after a minute the screen would disappear and the message would come up, something along the lines of \"You need to pay a subscription\". What??? After a week of using our own data on our 'phones due to this limitation (and stopping in at two more car hire offices to try and get help with it, without success), we discovered if we went through another field/screen, the map displayed would actually stay live and not disappear. Fancy having to work that out for yourself, and having the frustration of that limitation for a week, when the company can't help you. (No car manual in the car).\nAlso, like other reviewers, I WISH I HAD READ THESE REVIEWS BEFORE BOOKING!! Additionally, in talking to a friend, she had the same type of pressure to upgrade (although she stuck to her guns) with this company in NEW ZEALAND. This must be part of their policy and company training!! Maybe they get commission if they upsell?\nWould NEVER rent through them again."

However, upon arrival, the promised car was unavailable. The pick-up process was extremely slow, taking about an hour just to verify ID and address. This delay forced us to reschedule our plans, turning an already busy day into a stressful nightmare.\n\nThroughout the process, we felt bombarded with additional charges. They attempted to add fees for a \"popular pickup location,\" premium protection, and even cleaning—despite us already paying for extensive protection coverage.\n\nHere are some of the key issues we faced:\n\n1. The verification procedure took about an hour. This unnecessary delay disrupted our schedule and caused significant stress.\n\n2. As advised, we paid extra premium protection for the alternative car, thinking it was only a day of use and a premium service would give us ease of mind.\n\n3. While some loose dog hair ended up on our coats and my wife’s trousers, it was minimal. Despite this, Europcar insisted on specialist cleaning, claiming it was required for such a minor issue. We know firsthand that dog hair can be removed quickly with a vacuum and they provide standard cleaning for customers—it certainly doesn’t justify specialist cleaning fees. Plus we used other rental services and this was never an issue\n\n4. The rental was advertised at approximately £120, yet by the end, we were charged over £200 for just one day of use. We ultimately had to involve Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) to contest the cleaning fee.\n\nRegardless of the ADR outcome, we will never use Europcar again and strongly advise others to avoid their service. Renting from Europcar resulted in wasted time, unexpected stress, and substantial additional costs. And please save your reply by saying we need to send an email to your customer service team. We just got their reply. They said it was the final decision to use specialist cleaning service to remove some loose dog hair."

He said it was a mistake and Europcar would repay me shortly. They haven't. (I have seen similar things, on other rentals abroad but expected better here)"

I advise you all if you hire with this company don’t extend your reservation. When you call customer service they won’t help and say it’s taxes and fees etc. why not tell customers the full amount instead of leaving out about more than 50% extra charges that come with extending"

      "text": "Was falsely charged two fees; one for a delay returning the car which was caused by Europcar taking TWO hours to return a call for extending the rental - a call that they said would be \"within 15 minutes\". Then they added on an extra day rental for 53 minutes late return when it was due to their own delay in calling me.\n\nI suspect the delay in call back was in order to force the delay and make the extra charge. Very suspicious.\n\nThey then refused to remove that price with a customer service agent who presumably was provided by Little Britain.\n\nIn addition, there was a hidden charge for a \"premium\" drop-off location, which was not in the original agreement or detailed at collection.\n\nI'll soon to be making my feelings clear to over five million users on social media.\n\nAvoid this misleading, fraudulent company which does not value customers and would rather charge for a 53-minute delay in which THEY caused.\n\nYou should, though, perhaps also feel bad for Europcar because they are so desperate for money they insist on charging £25 incorrectly than settle this issue.\n\n* Edit: Europcar have responded to this review informing me to contact customer service. Which I have already done. And which they would already know if they had read my review. Further compounding their uselessness by proving they literally do not listen to what the customer has said."

      "text": "I recently booked a van with Europcar for a 6:00 PM collection, but my experience was highly disappointing due to miscommunication and poor service.\n\nI called the branch Trafford Park to inform them I would be about 10 minutes late for the collection. Initially, I was told there would be an additional charge if the van was booked out after 6:00 PM, which I reluctantly agreed to. However, I was then informed that the system does not allow bookings after 6:00 PM, contradicting the earlier statement. This lack of clarity and inconsistency was incredibly frustrating.\n\nMy booking was accepted for 6:00 PM, which should mean I can collect the van at that time. When I questioned why it was even possible to book for 6:00 PM if collection wasn't allowed, I was told that attempts had been made to contact me throughout the day and that my phone went to voicemail. This was completely false—my phone was on, operational, and I received no missed calls or voicemails. Being provided with such incorrect information only added to my disappointment.\n\nThis was my first time using Europcar, and unfortunately, it has left a very poor impression. The repeated misinformation and lack of accountability suggest a lack of professionalism and integrity. If this is indicative of their standard practice, I find it deeply concerning.\n\nOverall, my experience with Europcar was unsatisfactory, and I am unlikely to use their services again unless significant improvements are made. I cannot recommend them based on this encounter."

At the Europcar collection desk they offered me the insurance upgrade and I declined, so they said how about instead of the additional driver charge I give you the full insurance so your total costs is almost the same. Sure ok that's a good deal to me. To my surprise when I return and review my credit card bill I have 2 charges. 1 from easycar and 1 from Europcar, total 400 more than the price I signed up for when I booked. What a scam. I am disgusted. At least the other rental companies I have used from Manchester airport have never done anything like this.\n\nUpdated in response to your comment below: I had raised it on email already and it remains unresolved. You informed me to go speak to EasyCar about the additional driver charge, which indicates your guy had no authority to do what he did and say 'how about we waive the additional driver charge and use that to top up the insurance instead'. Complete scam, I have contacted the bank re unauthorsied charges on my CC. You shouldn't be allowed to operate like this. It's theft.\n\nBy the way, did you know that Trust Pilot can actually connect you with me if you really want to resolve it. I guess so."

      "text": "After a smooth trip and returning my rental car, I thought everything was sorted. But a week later, I received an email from Europcar informing me of a £35 fine, along with a £45 administrative fee. I immediately paid the fine and sent the proof of payment to Europcar, believing the issue would be resolved. However, much to my frustration, I received a generic email stating that the £45 fee would be charged regardless, even though I had resolved the fine myself, with no intervention required from Europcar.\n\nAfter leaving a review describing this absurd experience, Europcar responded with a standard message:\n\n“Give us the chance to solve the issue by providing more details using this link, where our customer service team will be in touch.”\n\nBut here’s the truth: this is the same canned response Europcar sends to every complaint. It seems like an attempt to publicly appear responsive, but in reality, they simply do not reply to emails. I followed their instructions, submitted my information, and waited patiently. Days passed, and I received no response, no follow-up, and no resolution – just silence.\n\nIt’s clear that this automatic response is nothing more than an attempt to create the illusion of addressing complaints. I wouldn’t be surprised if most customers, like me, never hear back. Europcar appears more interested in maintaining a façade of good customer service than actually providing it.\n\nThis experience has only deepened my disappointment with Europcar. Charging an unfair fee is bad enough, but ignoring customers who seek solutions is even worse.\n\nConclusion: Europcar, your practices are unfair, and your lack of commitment to customer satisfaction is glaringly obvious. To anyone reading this: if you value your money and your peace of mind, avoid this company. I will never rent from Europcar again."

      "text": "After posting a review on Trustpilot, I was invited to “give us the chance to solve the issue by providing more details.” I hope this email outlines my concerns clearly and helps you understand the level of disappointment I feel regarding my experience.\n\nI booked a van online on 8th January, specifically requesting an early pick-up at 7 am. I paid an additional fee for this time slot as I needed to meet a strict schedule to offload at an exhibition. The payment was processed successfully, However, I never received an email confirmation. Fortunately, I took a screenshot of the transaction, which I have attached for your reference.\n\nThe day before the pick-up, I contacted customer services to confirm my reservation and was assured that my booking had been processed and the van would be ready at 7 am the next day.\n\nOn the day of collection, I arrived at the Enfield branch promptly at 7 am, only to find the branch closed. I waited outside until someone eventually arrived at 8 am – an hour later than expected.\n\nI explained to the staff member that I had booked a van for 7 am, only to be told that \"this never happens.\" Eventually, I was given two options: continue with the booking and contact customer services later or cancel the reservation and rebook on the spot. Already behind schedule due to the delay, I chose to continue with the booking.\n\nThe issues didn’t end there. I was provided with a van but had to wait for the windscreen to clear as the branch had run out of de-icer. Adding to my frustration, the van’s dashboard display did not clearly indicate how much fuel was available. This only became a problem during drop-off when I was informed that I needed to refill the tank. I incurred an additional cost of £35 for refuelling, which seemed excessive given the distance I had driven.\n\nThroughout the day, I attempted to contact customer services. On my first call, the agent hung up on me. On my second attempt, I was told there was nothing that could be done.\n\nIn summary, I am deeply disappointed with this entire experience. From the lack of professionalism displayed by your staff to the failure to provide basic services (such as having the van ready at the booked time), every aspect of this booking was poorly handled.\n\nFurthermore, the additional £35 refuelling fee and the absence of any apology or meaningful resolution from customer services have left me questioning your commitment to customer satisfaction. I expect a full refund of the additional costs incurred, along with an explanation of how you intend to prevent such issues from happening in the future.\n\nThis is the response I got from Customer services.\nThank you for contacting Europcar customer services in regards to the reservation xxxxxx and for taking the time to share your experience with us.\n\nI truly apologise for the frustration and disappointment you encountered during your recent rental. I fully understand the impact that these issues have had on your schedule, and I am genuinely sorry for the inconvenience caused.\n\nI deeply regret that the van was not ready at the agreed time, and I recognise the importance of punctuality, especially when you had a tight schedule to meet. I also apologise for the lack of acknowledgment from our staff and the difficulties you faced with the windscreen and fuel gauge. This is certainly not the level of service we aim to provide.\n\nI am pleased to inform you that I have refunded the extra 60 GBP fee you paid for the early 7:00 am pick-up. The refund has been processed and should appear in your account up to 10 working days.\n\nPlease know that your feedback is important to us, and we are taking it seriously. We are reviewing our processes to ensure this kind of situation does not happen again in the future.\n\nOnce again, I apologies for the inconvenience and stress this caused, and I truly appreciate your patience throughout this matter. If you need any further assistance or have additional questions, please do not hesitate to reach out. I am here to help.\n\nRegards,\n\nEuropcar UK Group | Customer Services"

      "text": "Europcar have billed me 15 000 pounds for damages - I only had the van for about half an hour\n---------\nI first realised something was seriously wrong when waiting at traffic lights on Park Road in Portsmouth and I could see smoke coming from the van. This was about half an hour after picking up the van in Southampton.\nAlmost immediately after picking the van up, the accelerator started whirring (as a result of a radio program, when I heard someone mention that this sound can result from a broken turbocharger, I questioned whether the van was turbocharged but received no reply).\nThe van had stalled about 10 times on the way (but obviously not on the motorway which makes up the bulk of the distance)\nIt was my intention to turn off Park Road at the bottom (which you used to be able to do - I had done this in the opposiute direction only recently) but I soon found out that that was no longer possible. It is hard to say because I no longer live in Portsmouth but presumably there were signs indicating that after crossing the traffic lights the only option was to enter Gunwharf Quays (several hundreds of metres away), but I was distracted by the smoke (which I only slowly realised was coming from my van)\nYou would not expect such a thing to happen to a rental vehicle only half an hour after you had picked it up\nInexorably I was drawn into Gunwharf Quays, into the underground car park. There appeared to be no obvious 'escape routes' and when I hit the height restriction sign there was no obvious way out (all this was happening while I was being distracted by a van that could, for all I knew, burst into flames at any moment'). By this time I was half underground, with a queue of traffic behind me - it would have seemed likely to me that was still an 'escape route' moving forward (which is the only way I could go), until I hit something. I am still not 100% certain what I hit - it was not a low roof or anything like that which would have been obvious to see coming.\nIt seems strange to me to be only told about height restrictions when it is too late to do anything about it.\nI had no option but to go backwards, under guidance from staff, and then parked up about 50 metres away, after being sent down an unmarked 'escape route' leading to the shops. That was when I called the AA because of the smoke\nThe AA man just made some claims that I must have been riding the clutch and then let me go. I then left to go to Western Parade\nAfter loading up, the van limped about 30 metres before coming to a stop and refusing to re-start. I then called the AA for a second time\nAfter coming to the conclusion that the clutch was burnt out, this second AA man was with me for about 3 hours and arranged the consequences. The van was taken away by Boarhunt. Europcar paid for a hotel room for the night\nProblems\nRight from the beginning, Europcar have claimed that the AA only attended once. But this is illogical. The van was not taken away after this first AA visit at between 11 and 12 in the morning and it was not taken away from Gunwharf Quays. It was taken away about 11 hours later from Duisburg Way which is about 2 km away.\nThe clutch had gone and this was unlikely to have resulted from the actions of any driver within half an hour.\nThey seem to imply that I picked up the van from Southampton and then within half an hour I had not only reached Portsmouth but had loaded the back of the van completely with my worldly goods.\nIt is not good service to have problems within half an hour of taking possession\nPersonal Consequences\nExtra expenditure to me was around 800 pounds. But after they announced on Friday that they were not going to supply a replacement van, I decided to travel up to Liverpool and arrange things at my new flat. Unfortunately I couldn't find anywhere to stay on the Saturday so I had to spend the night in a local park, an experience I hope to never repeat (this was a night when I should have been spending my second night in my flat). This experience almost trumps the loss of money"

It was 3.30 in the morning. I was now panicking as I had a flight to catch. Eventually myself and family managed to get a taxi. I dropped the key back to the office but with no time to call the 24 hr breakdown line. The office still closed. I nearly missed my flight, it was very stressful.\nAs soon as I landed back in UK, I called europcar to explain the situation. Worst Customer service they were so unorganised and unhelpful. I had no apology for the inconvenience. To my horror I then get a email invoice to say that they were charging me another €180 for breakdown recovery and a surcharge. This is utterly unacceptable. This was through no fault of my own. They should be compensating me! I only hired the veichle for 2 day. Costing my a whopping €200 euro with fully comprehensive insurance, which I assumed would cover you for any breakdown during your rental. I would advise anyone to never use this company utterly apporling treatment."

      "text": "The worst, utterly disgraceful, experience I've ever had hiring a car. I booked a manual for two days, went to collect it from the Victoria London branch. I mentioned I only needed it for one day but had to book it for two as there was no mention online I could drop it off after hours on the day I needed it. The manager told me I could have booked it for one day. As compensation, as he added he couldn't change the booking in his system (???) so he offered to upgrade me to an automatic for free so long as I dropped it off by Saturday 1pm. I agreed, signed the form and returned the car full of petrol by 1pm Saturday. I then received notification from my bank that I'd been charged two days using an automatic, plus two days insurance. I called Europcar customer service to complain. They told me as I signed the contract there was nothing they could do. Plus they refused to put me through to the Victoria branch manager or put me through to their senior manager to raise the complaint. Incensed, I then went to the Victoria Europcar shop to explain to the manager the booking error. He wasn't there. I went again and again and again, three times he still wasn't there. These three times I explained to the Victoria staff in the manager's absence the mishap that had happened. Each time the staff I spoke to told me they'd get the manager to call me to sort out the mis-booking. The manager never called me. The fourth time I arrived at the Victoria branch, the manager was finally there, but kept me waiting 1/2hr before he turned up to talk to me. He looked surprised at my appearance and said he'd heard nothing about my complaint from any of his staff or customer services. The staff member behind me, who I'd met the day before and who'd promised to pass on my message, put his head in his hands. We knew perfectly well the manager was lying. He then told me I was lying and had made this whole thing up. He said he never offered me a free upgrade to an automatic from a manual car. He added, as I'd signed the contract my complaint meant nothing. But the contract I signed was misleading. The sum for £164 was black bold with lots of small type around it. This amount sounded about right for a 2 day manual hire including insurance I'd agreed to add on to the initial £115 fee. Not the £320 that was actually deducted from my bank account for a two day automatic hire. The manager walked off dismissing me. I called Europcar customer service again to complain. Three times the Europcar customer service put the phone down on me. I can't tell you how unjust, dishonest, disgraceful and unsettling this experience has been. I will never hire a Europcar EVER again."

At the east London branch I was given a large SUV sized vehicle (I didn’t know the size of it at the desk - an MG HS). During the rental I unfortunately kerb damaged an alloy wheel due to the size of the vehicle. On return the branch was closing and staff advised me to use the drop box which I did. The next day I was charged £70 for early return of the vehicle, on complaining Europcar said they would refund the amount due to an error. Am still awaiting the refund. With regard to the alloy wheel damage, Europcar three weeks on have yet to provide an invoice for the damage in order for me to raise an external insurer claim. Attempting to contact Europcar at a UK office is impossible via telephone and emails are replied to in a generic fashion with no attempt made in resolving issues by their staff. Overall experience is dreadful. Am genuinely sad for Europcar in the UK as I have used them for 6 years previously and found their service fair, even when minor damage has happened."

Insurance and everything is covered by the broker. We just wanted to pick up our rental.\n\nWhat happened?\nAt the Europcar counter we were greeted by Euan (or Ewan). He seemed like one chirpy Scotsman. To our delight he upgraded us \"free of charge\". What an amazing guy! We couldn't believe our luck. He said, \"you definitely need something bigger where you are headed and I have just the car\".\n\nThere was no mention of additional costs whatsoever.\nWho wouldn't like a free upgrade when they're headed into the Scottish outback?\n\nSome papers were elegantly shuffled around, we were told to sign here, here and here. After that we had to pop our card into the machine for the deposit and it was a done deal. Only it wasn't.\n\nThe trickery and the damage.\nThe upgrade was not free of charge and the additional cost of the rental was £171.86 or EUR 205. EXTRA! That's more than the initial rental booking. Both numbers look extremely similar by the way. When we inserted our card for the deposit, we in fact paid for the upgrade. That was NEVER mentioned to us. We also never paid for a deposit, which is utterly bizarre. The kicker is that we didn't receive an end of rental statement either. Also, the charge for the upgrade was not taken out until 2 weeks after the rental (06/11/24). So even if we had paid with Monzo, which shows charges instantly we would not have realised it then and there at the counter.\n\nOf course we signed the papers and that's enough for Europcar. Why would they care? Their golden boy Euan is ripping off people by the planeloads making the rental car company a F-ton of extra money. Unfortunately our broker nor our bank couldn't help, but that's not the end of it. A quick Google search reveals that this isn't Euan's first con nor that Europcar will ever see the promised land.\n\nBEWARE: Euan is a smirking bastard who is out to get you. Be it extra insurance you don't need or \"free\" upgrades.\n\nPLEASE read what you sign.\n\nFURTHER ACTION will be taken via BVRLA.\n\nIf you read this and were scammed as well please take action. Do not let them get away with this. We will create a case and if necessary hire a lawyer collectively. Please get in touch.\n\nRobin Metzler"

The writing on the rental agreement was so bad and resembled the amount in Euros I prepaid but was in fact the extra amount for the upgrade in GBP! Instead of 172.15 Euros, we paid £172 extra for the unsolicited upgrade. He shuffled the papers in front of us, no detailed explanation and we signed. I usually read every single line on these contracts but he had a talent to charm and con us into it.\nWhen I entered the card into the card pay machine, I assumed it is for the deposit. We were not given any receipt for any transaction at any time, again, thinking it is for the deposit.\nIn the Europcar yard I realised that there were no small cars parked anywhere and again assumed that we got a larger one because they didn't have a small car available.\nOnly when I checked my bank account when we were back from Scotland, I realised that we got charged for the upgrade on top of the initial payment! A deposit was never taken out of the account. The fact that the money was only taken out of my account 2 weeks after the rental also shows that nothing was done by the book. If I had seen the amount on a receipt or in my transactions straight away, we could have turned on our heels. But if you get deceived in such a way, you don't expect bad intention. We also never received an end of rental statement via email as it usually is the case.\nI filed two complaints with Check24, the German booking website, however, they closed the case twice after trying to solve the issue with Europcar.\nThis is not where it ends, Europcar. I'm taking this to the BVLRA for further investigation. It can't be the case that so many people get scammed by Europcar and get away with it.\nAnd if you, Europcar, send an automated reply to this rating and how sorry you are about the experience, then do something about the scammers you employ at your rental desks.\nThis has to end!"

However, upon arrival, the staff member seemed confused about my booking and initially provided me with a petrol car instead of the EV I had reserved. After realising the mistake, she had to swap the cars, causing a delay. As a result, I did not receive the car until 1:36 pm.\nWhen I returned the car, I made sure it had a battery charge level of 55%. Yet, the invoice inaccurately claims that the charge level was only 42%.\nThe problems didn’t end there. On 7 January 2025, I noticed that £54.86 had been deducted from my deposit without any explanation or invoice. I contacted Europcar to inquire about this, but I have received no response.\nThis experience has left me deeply frustrated. Not only does Europcar fail to deliver accurate service, but they also show no regard for transparency or customer communication. If you rent from them, be prepared for false charges and the possibility of having to pursue legal action to recover your money. I will now be commencing legal proceedings to address this issue.\n\nI strongly advise others to avoid Europcar entirely. This was one of the worst rental experiences I’ve ever had."

      "text": "I noticed, more than a month after my rental that this company (Manchester Airport Branch) had charged for damages without any notification.\nAfter challenging this I received excuses like your email address was incorrect, strange given that they had emailed me the booking confirmation for the same when I booked it. They also sent photos of the supposed damage, of the wheel, which could have been from any car, it did not even give enough of an image to show it was even the same colour car, apparently you cannot show the damage without an extreme close up? Also increasing my frustration on this was that I had booked what was supposed to be one of their premium cars and to be frank it was a wreck which when I complained at pick up was told \"its driveable so its rentable\" and \"if you want to replace the best we can provide you with is this car\" a car which was not a \"premium car\" and not in any way the same size to accommodate our Luggage.\nI would strongly recommend not to use this company, I certainly won't be doing again.\nUpdate following response from Europcar\nThankyou for your prompt response however please note that I did not write this review immediately after the issue, I communicated via email with your Customer Services on various occasions and it was only after receiving unacceptable responses that I posted this review."

      "text": "I would give this company 0 stars if I could. I stupidly did not read reviews before booking and naively thought such a well known company would be better. I really just wanted to book a car for a week, pay for it, with the price quoted and safely drive to my destination. I was quoted £467 for a car for 1 week which I think is way too much anyway. After booking I rang customer service as a change in plans meant I needed an infant car seat for my 4 month old baby. This was completed over the phone, quote changed slightly. I rang and emailed customer services the day before travel and was reassured everything was as it should be. Imagine my surprise when I arrived and was told I did not have a car seat booked, just a device (apparently a legal requirement seeing as Italian people have a tendency to leave their children in cars!) So I was charged for a car seat. Then pressure sold insurance. My £467 escalated to £968 (including a £100 hold on my credit card). The rep at the desk then handed me the most disgusting, filthy car seat, absolutely not fit for a 4 month old and told us to go and find the car, with 2 suitcases, bags and a baby in a pushchair. Checked my credit card statement, final charge was £721.33 + £21.27 non sterling transaction fee 🤣."

As someone who travels to England twice a year, I will never use your services again, and I will make sure this situation is widely spread."

They try and pressure people and scare them into spending more money on extras such as the premium protection cover which is nearly as much as the rental itself by imposing a disgraceful £1600 compulsory excess which leaves the customer no choice but to take the protection. I said i didn't want it but they then went and charged me for it anyway a week later thinking i wouldn't notice!!?? They also tried to get me to pay for fuel i might not need by trying to charge me for a full tank of fuel in advance. You say 'make sure its empty before you return it' so you expect the customer to just drive around aimlessly burning off fuel that they didn't need to pay Europcar for in the first place? They're basically a bunch of fraudulent con artists and their sneeky pressure tactics to get more money out of people is absolutely disgraceful."

      "text": "Terrible experience - Europcar need to urgently update their t’s&c’s.\n\nThere is an undisclosed young drivers fee - the terms and conditions states “Under 25’s will face a young drivers fee”, which is the main reason why I booked the car with europcar, as I am 25 and this statement means I will not be charged any extra.\n\nUnfortunately I was faced with an extra £590 fee for my car on arrival, when the car booking itself was only £390. The first line you see on the t’s and c’s is the above (quote - UNDER 25’s), and you have to “click to read more” to read further where you see the line, “25’s AND under will be charged” etc. Why would I click to read further if the first, summarised thing I read clearly states it is relevant for UNDER 25’s, not 25 AND under?\n\nTo add to this, the fee wasn’t added until I arrived to collect, so I also could not cancel my car. I was within the 6 hour pick up time and so I would have been charged the full fair. I was left with no option but to take the charge, all because of an error on their side. My £390 car turned into a £980 one!! Absolute rip off.\n\nI feel I am entitled to a refund on this surcharge fee, and I would certainly not suggest Europcar to anyone."

      "text": "EDIT:\n\nEuropcar's response below suggests the left-hand doesn't talk to the right. I HAVE BEEN TALKING TO Customer Services, and they won't do anything.\n\nORIGINAL:\n\nI hired a van from the Wallisdown, Dorset branch, and the experience was nothing short of infuriating. Almost immediately after driving off, the door sensor alarm started blaring non-stop. No matter how many times I opened and closed the door, the alarm wouldn’t shut off. I was on a strict schedule, so I had no choice but to deal with the unbearable noise for the duration of my rental. I didn’t mention it right away, but when I returned the vehicle, I reported the issue, only to be told that because I had already checked the van back in, I would need to contact Head Office.\n\nAfter numerous frustrating emails, Head Office’s response was to offer me a voucher for future use—as if I would ever consider renting from you again! To top it off, the voucher comes with the delightful note that I can't even use it to hire a van. How utterly ridiculous. The hours of distress caused by that incessant, faulty sensor left both myself and my passenger with searing headaches. As an act of goodwill, I’d expect at least some form of compensation, yet here I am, left with nothing but a sour taste in my mouth. You’ve completely failed to address the issue, and I won’t be returning.\n\nAnd as a side note, I booked for a 2-day rental but returned the van after just one day. Yet, somehow, the staff \"forgot\" to inform me that the price wouldn't reflect a full refund, not even close to half the cost. It's shocking how careless and dishonest this entire experience has been.\n\nBONUS ISSUE\n\nLow Oil Sensor Warning: To make matters worse, the low oil sensor also activated during my rental. This raises serious concerns about the vehicle’s roadworthiness and the quality of maintenance checks your fleet undergoes before being rented out to customers."

The Europcar guy ask me the credit card again, ID documents again, providing me a new paperwork and give me an equivalent vehicle. Arrived at the hotel. having look at the new documentation, I realize an extra £2000 on that agreement. So the next day I made a phone call to Europcar asking what was that amount? a guy provide me a new phone number for accounting assistance on that matter. So, the new person was explain me, that amount of £2000 was a deposit, nothing was charged, if vehicle is returned with full gas on it, and without any damage, I Have an executive plan with Europcar, renting vehicle since more than 20 years., after 2 days, the Volvo x60 they gave me, stop running, so I had to call the assistance. Assistance van of AA, comes to my hotel, the guy say car has a fault on the battery electronic, so he was able to start with a new battery, asking me to return the brake down vehicle to London (2 hours driving ) take another vehicle and going back to the hotel, with another substitutive car for another 2 hours of driving. I'm 80 year old, planning to spend Christmas time with my family, due my daughter was need to have a surgery on 26 dec. So was really not possible to do this for me. So the AA guy made a call to his friend, after 2 hours comes another AA person, with a compatible spare part. just for fix the issue temporally. Vehicle then start again., but I lost all the morning waiting for the repair with no more time to take my family at the shopping tour programmed. At the end of the week I returned the vehicle to Europcar. and back to my country. after few days I received on my email. an invoice and I WAS CHARGED FOR AN EXTRA £2000 !!!! REASON UPGRADED VEHICLE (that I didn't ask) and AIRPORT FEES???? Called my bank for block that charged, They couldn't do it. Called Europcar In italy, they couldn't do it! they say go to London and speak to the guy who made the paperwork??? I will call my ADVOCATE, this is a pure scam!, Vehicle was already pay in full in advance as I TRUST THEM, such disgraceful behavior! I will never back to this company anymore, I recommend. to any one instead TO TAKE A TAXI ! It will save you money and frustrations!"

Around an hour later they rock up with a dirty Skoda and when I asked where the VW was I was told that all their “good cars” went up to the airports on transporters for the Christmas rush and I could either take the Skoda or they could take it back to the branch and cancel the booking. Had I not needed it that night I would have definitely rejected it.\nI get that the car was not filthy but when paying £400 of my hard earned cash I was expecting them to have at least whipped the hoover around it.\nI have so far been offered a £30 refund, not even 10% of the cost! Absolute joke. I see from other reviews that they supply courtesy cars for the mobility scheme, fair enough - these people aren’t paying directly so should be happy with whatever they’re given but when you’re paying your own money it is just not good enough.

      "text": "TERRIBLE!\nMy booking was made via a broker, but that shouldn't matter.\nI opted to rent a small car to travel from Scotland to Wales over the Xmas period.\nOn arrival at the europcar office, St. James centre Edinburgh I was politely greeted followed by \"would you like to upgrade?\". I had no desire to upgrade as it was already expensive and I didn't need a bigger vehicle. This was before I even knew exactly what make and model of car I was about to receive.\nWhen I did finally get the keys to my rental car, having had a £700 pound deposit taken from me, I discovered I had unintentionally rented an MG3. My heart sank. The deposit, whilst huge in my opinion wouldn't have bothered me so much, however it had to be taken from my debit card as that was the card I had used to make the booking. I asked to use my credit card for this but was told that wasn't allowed. Now I'm £700 short over the Xmas period with a mortgage and bills upcoming!!\nI drove the car away, having travelled no more than a mile and already I found the car to be unbearable, the thought of a 5.5hr journey on the M6 when I hadn't even yet reached 30mph was frightening.\nThe road noise was so intrusive I could barely hear my own thoughts, my skeleton was starting to feel the effects of the terrible chassis and suspension.\nI can only describe this car as a very basic vehicle barely meeting the definition of a car, nevermind a modern car. The engine was so gutless, it was like it was powered by a sewing machine but with the noise of a tractor. The suspension felt like it was made of wood and bricks rather than springs and dampers. The headlights when it became dark were she equivalent of 2 candles and the whole time I'm starting to develop a head ache and ringing ears. I hated this car, really hated it. A quick search on auto trader revealed from 41small cars the MG3 to be the worst at #41.\nMy experience got worse when I returned it.\nI returned the vehicle early as I was keen to get my deposit back, so wanted to be present when it was inspected on its return. However, I was told that that vehicle wouldn't be inspected until the following day, where it would sit in a public multi-storie car park overnight. The car could be in a very different condition over that time to when it was returned.\nWith regards to the car when I complained, the agent's response was \"it's because it's a cheap car\". Wow!\nNow, the car has been returned, but not inspected at that point. I phoned the branch the next at 14:00, but the office is closed, so I phoned customer services. They couldn't even confirm the car had been returned and didn't even know where it was. What??\nFollowing day, I phoned the branch to ask for confirmation that the vehicle had been returned and it's condition so I could be assured I was going to receive my deposit. I was told a manger would email me, that didn't happen. A 2nd phone call later in the day and I was told they hadn't emailed me because it was via a broker. They had my email address which had been provided no less than 3 times. I had to push hard for them to agree to send an email confirming the condition of the vehicle and that I was going to get my deposit back. Unbelievable!\nHaving hired many cars from other vendors I've always had a good experience,where the vehicle has been checked on return and good communication, not with EUROPCAR. I will never use them again. Ever!\nBy the way not only was the car rated 41/41, it only has a 3* euro cap rating, meaning it's just about safe."

I am quite tall person 5'8 so this car was really uncomfortable, nevertheless I accepted as it was only for 2 days, and my next rental was with enterprise (who are so much better, it's like night and day). I can only thank God that I actually took photos of the entire vehicle, before taking it out, honestly, never forget to inspect the vehicle before driving off with it. There was one of their employees staring me down while I was doing this (he looked so annoyed) so I called him over and asked why the tyres had no dust caps, plus I mentioned the same scratches and scruffs the woman who gave me the keys had mentioned. He literally said \"don't worry we don't consider those.\" Upon returning the vehicle, I handed over the keys and they did not inspect the car while I was there, I was told my deposit would be in my account after the woman inspects the vehicle (the same guy I saw when I was taking the pictures and the same woman who gave me the keys we're chatting really in deep conversations) so she was saying I can leave. So I left, the money was returned into my debit card, as I didn't use a credit card, I received a statement of return few days later, and the said I tore/ ripped the two front tyres, funny that because I had the exact same pictures of these \"tears/ ripped\" tyres from that moment I took the pictures before leaving with the vehicle. A few days later I received another email on Christmas Eve of damage notification of the exact same tyres I photographed. This is by far the least worst experience I've actually read on here. I don't understand why they would release my deposit if they believed I damaged the tyres. There is no way they can charge my bank and just in case they do I've already reported the account I used as stolen/ blocked."

Man was I wrong. Received our car without the staff doing any precheck and straight away noticed there was a low tire pressure dash light on. When going back to the counter they closed and locked up in the 5 min it took us to walk to the car. Was 10pm at night so nothing to do but take the rental or be stranded two hours from our hotel. Ended up with the car breaking down and then being charged \"damage\" fee and nearly missed our flight. Disputed and dealt with the absolute worst customer service. Could not recommend strongly enough to never book Europcar UK. What an absolutely joke."

Upon returning the vehicle, the shutter was down and there was nobody there to take the keys/refund me my £250 deposit.

I book the rail station branch as I needed to get a train home (I am disabled and cannot walk far).

He said I shouldn't be so dramatic and never once said sorry for this inconvenience.\n\nI then take it to the next nearest branch who told me they cannot accept the car and that Younes had given me incorrect information. They then told me to take it back to the Newcastle branch and post the key through the door. I said I was worried about them trying to charge me for any damage that may occur between Saturday and Monday but they assured me it'll be fine.\n\nI have emailed a complaint however had not heard back and I'm filled with anxiety that they are going to try and charge me more.\n\nPlease save your sanity and do not book with this company."

      "text": "The practices of the London Gatwick office are completely and utterly fraudulent. I write this review so others can be armed with information and well prepared not be defrauded by this specific Europcar office of London Gatwick airport.\n\nI rented a car on the 30th August with no additional insurance protection to cover the excess because it was already covered on my credit card insurance. I communicated this to the representative who then included medium protection on the package and completely disregarded my verbal request. He asked me to sign the back of the page which I did as it was left completely blank without any additions.\n\nAfter the rental had ended I recognised I had been charged extra on my credit card although there was no follow up email from Europcar to inform of any of the charges (although my email was clearly included on the agreement). I called the office and to my shock they forwarded through the back page agreement which now had handwritten additions of the medium protection package.\n\nEuropcar, let’s be clear, this is complete and blatant fraud to change a document after it has been signed! Not only this, but I was also charged for 7 days of insurance even though the rental lasted for only 5 days! See photos on Google Review of Europcar London Gatwick for confirmation of this. This rental finally cost me almost triple the price that what was originally agreed in the initial reservation.\n\nTherefore, I advise anyone attending the Europcar Gatwick office to follow these recommendations:\n1. Record your conversation on your phone with any attendant at this office. If the attendant complains or refuses then point them to this review and ask to speak with their manager.\n2. Ensure that the attendant countersigns any documents in front of you before leaving the counter. If the signature looks similar to the one I have posted on the Google review then I advise requesting a manager or another attendant to complete the rental agreement.\n3. Cross out any inclusions that are not agreed to and take a photo of the main rental agreement and the back page that list additions so it can’t be changed afterwards.\n4. Finally, please post your review of this office so that others can be informed of this fraudulent behaviour, and the individual perpetrators are held accountable.\n\nEuropcar: If this review means that customer check-in at the Gatwick office takes far longer than any other office then you only have yourselves to blame. I have called customer service on multiple occasions with no action being taken. I have also sent multiple emails that all have been ignored now for over 3 months, which is well over the cited 7-10 days reply time that is promised. You will find the ignored case number as #21259873. I request that a refund be issued for these unauthorised charges and that this fraudulent behaviour of Europcar staff is prevented from occurring any further, especially by the individual that signed this document. If you want to show any endeavour to remain a reputable company then I expect a prompt reply to this review via my email which you have on file. My previous experiences with Europcar have all been positive but this is appalling. It is also worth checking that in all my other rentals I have never requested insurance and I never will. Please check your records to confirm this."

I was happy as I have not had issues with Europcar before.\nTravelling with my 5yo Daughter I decided that I would just pick up a car seat at the airport THIS WAS MY FIRST MISTAKE. To hire a child seat for the day is a ridiculous price the guy at the counter told me something like 16 pounds per day almost the same price as the car. Hiring for over a week this was a huge extra cost (cheaper to buy one). However I was told that for an extra £30 per day I could get an upgraded car and forget about cost of car seat. Reluctantly I agreed, and with a quick swoshing of paperwork I signed the paperwork. As I booked the car in one currency and the documents are in a different currency I did not do the maths I just kept in mind the 30£ extra per day. When I got the bill there was an extra charge of 100 from the 30£ per day quoted. Having spoken to 2 different people at europcar one said it was Vat one said it was a location charge. In either case it does not seem clear to Europcar what the charge is for.\n\nI have tried clarifying this with Europcar on two occasions and have just been fobbed off. The last person I spoke to said they would raise a case.\n\nRecommendation to anyone using Europcar. Be careful of the extortionate cost of hiring car seats, Read the paperwork you sign very carefully, I actually feel they purposely deceive weary travellers into signing things and paying uneccesary upgrades. Also don't expect customer service to help afterwards.\n\nIf you book through an alternative supplier probably best not to upgrade at all as you just get tied up in paperwork."

It stated that I could leave a deposit instead of using a credit card. However, upon arrival at Goldcar Portugal, I was informed that they do not accept deposits under any circumstances. This was the first misleading claim.\nAdditionally, the voucher indicated that renting a device for automatic payment on highway tolls was optional. Again, this was false. According to the staff at the Goldcar counter, the toll payment device is mandatory, not optional as stated in the voucher.\nDue to these inaccuracies and misleading representations on Europcar’s voucher, I was unable to use the service as it would have incurred significantly higher costs than initially quoted.\nI wrote an email complaint to Europcar, clearly outlining how the service they sold me was misrepresented and requesting a refund. After an unacceptable delay of eight weeks, I received a dismissive, generic response that completely ignored the reason of my complaint, simply stating that no refund would be issued because the voucher was not used. This completely missed the issue: I did not use the voucher because of the false terms Europcar provided.\nI responded to this inadequate reply, requesting a proper analysis of my complaint. Four months have now passed, and I have yet to receive any follow-up or resolution.\nIronically, when I submitted a negative review on Europcar’s customer satisfaction survey, I was contacted multiple times the same afternoon. Unfortunately, this was futile as the representatives could not address my complaint, citing it as a matter for a different department."

Payment was taken in advance upon reservation. Upon arriving at the airport at 9pm on 16th December, the keys were not released to me. No reason was provided. I was handed a piece of paper with an email address to find out further information. I was then stranded at the airport with no way to reach my destination. The airport eventually closed and I had to wait outside for a ride to my destination as my presence in the airport was not allowing the airport staff to leave and I did not wish to delay their arriving home safe. Europcar didn’t have a similar concern as I was left outside in the rain, in the Scottish Highlands, at 10pm. Surely 22 days is ample time between the reservation being made and my collecting the car to prevent this from happening?\n\nThe following day I sent an email to the email address I was provided to inquire further. The email was re-directed to the branch. I found this odd, as why would the branch instruct me to email the address provided if that email address was going to re-direct me back to the branch? Regardless, I waited a further day for contact. No contact was received. I then began to get concerned as they had already taken payment and my booking was live on the app and I had not received a refund. I proceeded to call Europcar on three occasions. On each occasion the advisor tried their best, but due to company policy being flawed, they were unable to advise me regarding my refund or the booking. Each advisor referred me back to the branch. I would recommend they listen back to the call logs in this instance as all three advisors agreed that the situation was a mess.\n\nThe branch did not contact me as promised, so I returned to the branch. No further information was provided and I was once again referred back to head office.\n\nThis has been a horrendous ordeal. Europcar need to consider the appalling customer experience that is delivered. Note I am a repeat customer, having rented cars on three occasions using Europcar, and was still treated terribly.\n\nDo not use. There are other rental companies that will take your custom and deliver what is promised.\n\nEDIT: in response to the canned response left by Europcar, I contacted using the link provided and have not received any response.

So I am glad it’s fixed now, just caused a lot of stress on the way. - ***\n\nI had a Europcar rental for three months while my Mercedes was being repaired, and the experience was abysmal from start to finish. The car was delivered with only 3/4 of a tank of fuel, despite their policy stating it should arrive with a full tank, yet I was still charged for fuel I didn’t use. When it came to collection, they left the car in my driveway for over a week and then gave me just two hours’ notice while I was 800 miles away on business. I had to scramble to get my brother to drive 60 miles round trip to hand over the keys.\n\nDespite these massive inconveniences and their lack of professionalism, Europcar has shown no interest in addressing my concerns or resolving these unfair charges. They expect customers to bend over backward for their mistakes while offering no accountability or goodwill in return. I’ll never use Europcar again and would strongly advise others to avoid them."

Hired vehicle for a week from Gatwick Airport, desk agent offered a car upgrade stating £40 only, he listened to our family discussion that it was only £40 more and we agreed. In fact this was a daily cost, the agent made no attempt to correct our mistake and we didn’t fully check the upgrade agreement to spot his underhand technique. Following the hire we were also invoiced for new damage to the car, luckily we had photographic evidence that proved the damage was existing damage and the invoice was cancelled. An extremely disappointing and stressful service in which we felt Europcar were only interested in getting as much money out of us as possible. Never again!

However the Swindon branch has topped this by generating an invoice in Dec for me hiring a van for 8 days excess mileage and a late return billing me over £500. This relates to a 3 day hire in October that was all settled and van returned on time and less excess mileage paid. After receiving emailed invoice I have contacted customer services whilst they ask branch to investigate. In the meantime the branch has taken £250 out of my bank account using my debit card that was used for the £250 security deposit in October. I managed to stop them taking another £54 from my credit card. I am beyond impressed with them. A hire before this one took 4 months and 4 phone calls and visits to sort out incorrectly billed excess mileage- make sure you take pics on collection and drop of if you really want to risk using this cowboy company!! Thanks for your pointless response below - I’d already spoken to your customer services who raised a dispute with the branch who then stole £250 from my account"

This is after spending £300 plus on hotels and the channel crossing.\nTheir support team are still insisting they sent an email 3 days before the booking, but this simply isn't true - it certainly never reached my inbox, and I don't delete emails, so it would still be there if they had sent it. In fact Europcar sent me three emails during the booking process (so the email address they have for me is clearly correct and not going to the junk folder) one to confirm the booking, one 3 days before reminding me to bring my driving license, and one literally 1 hour before the booking saying \"You're going to get the keys at Oxford and you're ready to hit the road\"!!\nIf you need a van ad-hoc and are willing to try again another weekend, then go for it, but if you need it as part of a bigger plan, maybe find somewhere a bit more reliable."

The guy at the counter (Chris) did the paperwork and told me not to worry if I couldn't get back early Monday as they knew I had a 3-4 hr d I've back. On the Monday I got back to the branch around 2:30pm the same guy was there again on the computer he took the keys and said don't worry I'll check it back in for you. This all seemed fine until I was expecting my deposit back. I had the full amount to hire the car pending in my bank (hire & deposit) when all of a sudden it came out of pending and all I got back for my deposit was just over £20. I knew this was wrong as I filled the tank back up before dropping her car off. I knew I was owed around £250. When It didn't go in when I thought it would, I got in touch with them about it (which is also a near impossible task as they never seem to answer their phones it took ages). I was told then that because the car was late back they had taken an extra day off us. We told them the car was returned in plenty of time and what we were told at the desk. After some back and forth calls this Chris admitted he booked it in late and he had to fill in a form to get the money back and it would be sorted as it was his mistake. Ok I thought it's been sorted so waited again. It got to the 28th of November still no money back again I contacted them and was told the form was sent off now it's down to head office to approve it. I then took it upon myself to ring head office the person was rude and said that what I'd had back (£20 previously) was all I was getting and that's it. Now I'm mad 😡 I tried the branch again and after a lot of back and forth again was told now the office definitely have the paperwork and it just needs to clear and go into my bank. It is now the 9th December they have had my money for nearly a month, they are gaining interest on it and I'm out of pocket. I need the money back as it's Christmas and it will help. I really feel like they are taking me for a fool and they have really taken the P*** . Again trying to get in touch with them to no avail no one answering my calls please people if u can use another company or make sure when you take the car back that it's checked straight back in or you will have the same problem as me 😡😡😡"

When I returned the car at their centre in Salzburg airport, I was explicitly told that there were no additional payments to be made. However, I was shocked to later see that I was charged nearly €200 for cleaning, despite the fact that I had thoroughly cleaned the car before returning it and there was no mention or in the contract about any cleaning charges.\n\nWhat made the situation even worse was that they didn't inspect the car in my presence, even though I specifically requested it. It felt like they took advantage of the situation and slapped on an unfair charge without any justification.\n\nIt’s incredibly frustrating when a company gives you false assurances and then tries to impose arbitrary fees without transparency or accountability.\nI won’t be using this rental service again and would advise others to be very cautious before renting from Europcar & contact your credit card company after the rental return to put a block on Europcar before they steal your money."

On collecting the vehicle it was filthy dirty inside and out for which the staff member apologised,, explaining they were short staffed.\n\nJust received my final invoice to see I have been charged an additional £114 on top of the original £66 hire, for apparently an additional 559 miles above the 250 allowance.\n\nI covered a total of 108 miles in the 24hr hire, so not sure where they have recorded 809 miles from ?\n\nJust spoken to their customer service advisor and they will investigate this over the next 3-5 working days, including vehicle tracking information which will clearly show their mistake.\n\nIn the meantime they get to hold onto my money !!\n\nCHECK YOUR VEHICLE CAREFULLY BEFORE YOUR HIRE AND BACK IN AGAIN."

I realized this once the purchase had already gone through, I tried to cancel it but they weren't interested in helping me after I had handed over my money.\n\nMy complaint was ignored for two weeks before they sent me a canned response that the signature on the document was binding and this eliminated the possibility of a refund. I am now in the process of filing a complaint with an external regulatory body over their dishonest sales techniques.\n\nI ended up paying for unnecessary insurance that cost more than 150% of the car rental itself. No one would agree to this. Please be careful of this company's deceptive sales techniques, don't let them convince you that you need to give them more than you already have. Don't sign anything unless you're certain you understand what they are telling you. And be aware that you will likely not receive help from this company once they have received your money.\n\nUPDATE following the below response - Europcar has flatly denied my request for an investigation or a refund, requiring me to escalate the issue to a third party.\n\nI will never use this company again."

He rushed me to sign the so called standard form and directed me to take the car as there was another client behind me.\nA few day later I received the mail with a very unfortunate surprise, I was charged £30 + Vat for an extra total of £299,88. That added to my paid booking for a Citroen C3 Aircross makes a total of 463,49 (this makes the daily rate £66,21)!!\nThis is a scam. Please note that a Mercedes from Europcar starts around 34/35£ a day. I wonder what car costs around £66 /day!!! This is scam and the company refused to review the complaint.\nI strongly suggest to avoid accepting any upgrade from this company as they will in some way they will trick or deceive you.\nNever again Europcar.\nAnd it is pointless to contact your customer service, as I did immediately after two days of rent and again twice after I returned the vehicle. Always the same reply which obviously invites me to contact and recontact the “useless” customer service."

He told me to email them in, he did not come out and sign them off. I emailed the marks/crapes in together with photos. On my return the agent checked the car and then told me that there was a fresh scrape on the alloy. I had to go down on my hands and knees to see it. I advised him that I did not do this. As the shuttle bus was waiting for me I left immediately, Within an hour 189.99€ + 18.88€ was charged to my card. I asked for the science behind the comment 'it looks fresh\". I can only describe it as an appalling customer service. I felt I was scammed/ set up by Europcar."

Then When contacting customer services with both photographs and proof of both of these problems, they dismissed my concerns.

I rented this car for myself, my husband and a baby whilst on holiday. This car and the car seat were potentially unsafe.

This was the first indication that things were not going smoothly.\n\nDespite having paid in advance for insurance, we were informed there was an additional hidden fee for coverage, which was an unexpected and unwelcome cost. We had budgeted for the trip assuming everything was prepaid, so this extra charge forced us to adjust our finances.\n\nWhile returning the car, an object was thrown from the vehicle in front of us on the motorway, striking the windscreen and causing a chip. At the rental depot, we informed the agent of the incident, providing details of the time and location, and offered to file a police report to address the situation. The agent dismissed our offer, advising that there was no need for a report, as nothing would be done about the chip. Trusting their advice, we proceeded to catch our flight home.\n\nMonths later, we were surprised to receive a charge for the windscreen damage, as there was no third party to claim from. Had we followed through with the police report, as we initially offered, this situation might have been avoided.\n\nIn summary, we strongly recommend caution when renting from Europcar UK. From hidden fees to aggressive upselling tactics, it seems they are more focused on extracting additional charges after the rental is complete. Our experience left us disappointed and frustrated."

We were stood in the rain with my partner who uses a walking stick and were spoke to by a lady through a small window because they don't have a door for you to go through. We were told they were very busy although there was just this one lady not doing very much and that there were no other other vehicles available although there was a yard full of vehicles that resembles a scrapyard. Please please avoid this company and especially the Bradford branch."

The number rings out for 15mins and then ends the call saying the office is busy. Secondly they cancelled a reservation that they shouldn't have done as they claimed I hadn't collected it but I called to say I wanted it delivered. Thirdly after promising a replacement car after the initial car broke down they didn't follow through and left me.without a car.\nSo to recap non exist communication, not following through on timelines. There are better companies out there and it's a shame they are so bad."

      "text": "I booked a Citreon Berlingo from Maidstone branch for a 4 day booking, 2 days were needed for a trip to Nottinghamshire to pick up some garden equipment and 2 days to attend a photography course which involved visiting sites in Kent with width and height restrictions on access and parking hence the need for the Berlingo which is about the same height as a car and would be fine with the height restrictions. When I arrived to pick the vehicle up they did not have a Berlingo, only a Renault Traffic which is 2.4m high. Given the time and short notice I needed the van for the Nottinghamshire pick up so had no choice but to accept it, but I was unable to use it for the photography course and ended up borrowing a car for this. The vehicle was more expensive on diesel and more costly for the Dartford Crossing. Having returned the vehicle I complained to Europcar's central tel number only to be told that the Traffic and Berlingo are \"similar\" and they refused to consider my issue. In fact on Europcar's vehicle specification pages the Traffic is 2ft taller and at least 1ft wider. How can these be considered \"similar\"? No wonder their trust pilot ratings are so poor."

      "text": "This June I have reported I am in danger and the car I have renting from them is in danger too.Because I was challenging suspicious people, we can call them criminals wearing fully black clothes, shoes and SKI MASKS (end of June in 20 degrees) after midnight on the street in a posh area. (I am not writing every details down for a good reason ) They tried to damage the car that I was driving because I called the police on them and that was definitely an action which prevented one or multiple crimes that night. Later the police arrived and those criminals did hide and they lost they torch during they ran away. Following morning the neighbours told me around 5days earlier late night criminals are broke into someone's garage and many things were stolen and caused insane material damage. Where I found them it was the same location where the crime happened earlier.\nI wanted to protect the Europecar's and other citizens belongings from those criminals when I challenged them, but they did not appropriated I called the police and I disturbed their criminal activities that night so they tried to damage the car during I was driving. So after I asked help from Europcar, my prize was: a terminated contract that I did not know until it was discovered later by accidentally.\nHow's my torture started?\nI called the branch I told them what happened and what the police advised... I requested to swap my car regarding these serious facts. I had a call back from a female staff from Bristol Airport Branch a bit later who said I cannot get a different car and denied to give me her manager name that she referred to as a person who made this decision.I raised complaint later on that day via phone and the complaint team found their actions unprofessional.They asked me to send them the police log number that shows this was a real action. So, I have sent them via email and they said they will investigate it.\nI was not able to go back to that area with the car I am driving because the police advised me to don't do that, regarding the potential revenge of these criminals. Needless to say how hard was that day and night with these difficulties. Insane pressure on me either physically in danger, the car I have responsibility for also in danger and this was a huge psychological pressure for me... Terrible experience just because my safety and the car was not important for them.\nFollowing day (day after my request was refused by the airport team) I went to a different brunch with a hope they will give me a different car, but there we faced with a shocking fact, they discovered the car I am driving is not even contracted with me, that's meant I must not drive it. He advised me to go back to the Bristol Airport team and asking from them why is this car that I am using is not contracted with me. After my arrival to the Bristol Airport team they also confirmed face to face (not just one, two people) they will not give me a different car just because I AM IN DANGER AND THEIR CAR IS IN DANGER TOO. Yes,not their problem if I will be stubbed or end up in a hospital also if something happens with the car. I will need to pay for that damage anyway so that's not a problem for them.I am just a walking bankomat that's needs to pay and pay....\nAfter they stated this I told them I will be back tomorrow and I will bring the car back because they did this with me and I told them anyway the car is not contracted with me. I started to walk away but one of the member asked the reg.number to check why the other branch member said the car I am driving is not contracted. He found out why is my name not registered with the car. This reason was:\nbecause 28 hours earlier a different staff member (who denied to give me the manger's name and said they will not swap the car) terminated my contract. They also told it cannot be by mistake because this is a process to make it done,not just one red button to push. So, the person who discovered this problem said this is serious and he called a different brunch reached out a member there who can backdating/modify the contract. Yes, there is a man who knows the system very well and they calling him to make things to disappear , 'modify' in the system. So, the 28 hours of gap evaporated from my rental history. How do I know this? Because the Europcar stated multiple times there is no gap in my rental history and that gap is disappeared, I saw this with my eyes. However it was there before I have many different evidence for that. So, because of the terminated contract that he found,I couldn't drive the car that I am arrived with, so I had a different car from that night. And when I told him the stop start system is not working properly he just said \"this is MG\"\nNeedless to say, this is going to different social media platforms and I do work on it to publish in different news too plus goes to legal way to get my compensation for this long torture."

Upon arrival, I was offered a “free upgrade.” Tired after a 19-hour flight and being unfamiliar with the detailed terms, I trusted the salesperson’s assurances and signed the agreement. To my shock, I later discovered I was charged £847, including fees for services and upgrades I was never informed about.\n\nThese charges were not transparently explained during the transaction. While I acknowledge my signature, I believe this was obtained under misleading circumstances. The salesperson’s failure to disclose critical information left me feeling taken advantage of.\n\nI reached out to Trip.com to dispute these charges, but the resolution was unsatisfactory. Despite presenting my case, the charges remain, with no acknowledgment of their lack of transparency.\n\nUnfortunately, I am not alone. After my experience, I found several similar complaints about Europcar’s unclear practices, such as:\n\nTripAdvisor Review of Europcar Heathrow -\n1. “Scam Upgrade from Europcar!!”\n2. \"Scammed for Extras fees\"\n3. \"Reddit Post on Europcar Issues - Europcar Heathrow Rental Scam\"\n\nMy intent in sharing this review is to warn future customers. If you choose Europcar, I strongly recommend documenting every interaction, asking for detailed explanations of all fees, and carefully reviewing the agreement before signing. Transparency and trust are essential, and unfortunately, my experience with Europcar fell far short of this standard."

No proof of any damage done by me. Absolutely nothing. Nobody inspected the car when I picked it up or dropped it off. It’s cheaper that way for them having to employ people to check them in your presence. Just a sneaky charge on my credit card. Seems to me they bill everyone for damage, and never fix any of it. Basically the customer actually paying for the car they rent out.\nThe car had over 50k on the clock. It’s clearly a well used car.\nTo be honest, there was that many scratches and dents on it, it was hard to match up what there was on the paperwork.\nNow I’m going through the pain of trying to get it back through my credit card.\nNothing but crooks. They may as well dipped their hand in to my wallet.\n***update-***\nI challenged this charge and they come back to me with a refund. They haven’t actually told me what I was being charged for and they took over £600. It’s now taking up to 12 working days to refund it. If you ever hire a car, take pictures of ANY damage. No matter how small. Or how much. If there’s a lot reject it. (I should’ve done this). This car had so much damage on it, it was hard to distinguish what they actually declared. Mainly small dents , scuffs and scratches. And make sure you email them as soon as possible with the damage. Luckily I sent mine within 24 hrs and they had a time stamp which they asked for again. Hirer beware. Would even be advisable to take pictures when you hand it back to save any grief. Like the two weeks I’ve had dealing with this.\nGoldcar is next door to them in the terminal. I’m going back to them next time in Almeria.\nIf you honestly don’t contribute to any further damage and they bill you weeks later (like in my case) challenge it. I can’t believe I’m the first and won’t be the last.\nGood luck and happy holidays. This put a sour taste to the end of mine."

I feel like they have ripped me off by using a bait and switch on my chosen vehicle.\nOn perusing one of the aggregator websites,I was drawn to Europcar who were advertising a Mercedes GLA. The price was towards the higher side but I selected it as this is a vehicle I am specifically interested in.\nNot unsurprisingly, there was none available when I arrived to collect my vehicle. I was told that they don't actually rent out the Mercedes GLA, as it is soley used as a standby/emergency vehicle for when one of the other Mercedes products breaks down. That means that they never intended to rent the advertised vehicle and then they hide behind their T&C to provide another vehicle.\nTo add insult to injury, the \"other\" vehicle turned out to be an Audi Q2. This car is not even close to being in the same league. In fact, you will not see the Q2 advertised on their website because they would have to attach a publically visible value to it, which would reveal their malfeasance. Of course, all of this is allowed under their T&C and they remain the final arbiters of what is fair...\nTo be fair, their staff were friendly, pick up and drop off were straight-forward - pretty much a vanilla experience apart from the fact that they provided me with a cheap and nasty substitute vehicle."

Was left stranded on a bank holiday and had to arrange recovery myself. 6 months later received a letter from a solicitor asking for payment of a £1028.53 charge. I contacted Europcar who has failed to send any correspondence to me despite having me phone, email and address. They refused to share the itemized bill for repair from the dealership who provided the new key. Stating I only have access to the bill from them. No proof that it cost Europcar £1028.53 for a replacement key. Shortsighted. I now use Hertz regularly even when the quote is higher and I've had zero issues from them."

      "text": "I am a Motability customer and have had to have 3 ev loan cars from this company in the last 6 months due to ongoing issues with my Motability vehicle. No problem with the 1st car I had from them BUT, the last 2 bookings have gone disastrously wrong:\n\nThe 2nd car, an EV, had a faulty battery which wouldn't hold its charge and consequently had virtually no range.\n\nAfter approximately 4 hours of continuous calling and timed-out disconnections, I finally managed to get through to someone at Europcar who advised it couldn't be replaced until the AA had been called out. I was supposed to be transferred to the AA however I was just routed back to the main Europcar switchboard and had to wait a further 40 minutes before I spoke to someone. I asked for a direct number and eventually managed to get through to the AA, who then advised that they wouldn't be able to sort the battery issue and that I needed to re-call Europcar. After some negotiation and having explained Europcar's refusal to replace without a mechanic's report, the AA agreed to have a mechanic call. He duly arrived and advised the car needed to go back to Europcar for repair. He called Europcar, advised them that he was from the AA and that the car needed replacing.... they told him they couldn't help and that he needed to call the AA!!!! He was shocked. Between us, we agreed to drive down to the (Exeter City) branch to try to sort something out. Again, after some negotiation they agreed to provide another vehicle, however they wouldn't have a suitable car until later that day. They promised to call me when it was available so that I could drive back down and collect it that day. I NEVER received a call back. I attempted to contact the branch direct for updates on its availability later in the day, but they just picked up the phone and immediately put it down again. I ended up having to drive down to the branch the following day - fortunately the replacement vehicle was on the forecourt. I challenged the member of staff on duty about the lack of communication. He could not offer any reason as to why I hadn't been contacted and was totally unapologetic for all of the inconvenience, stress and anger Europcar's inactions had caused. NB the replacement car provided was also damaged.\n\nThe 3rd car - I'll keep this brief.....! What Car? Europcar were notified at the beginning of the month that I would need a car for today, 18 November. I got a call from them 3 days before to discuss my needs, and was advised that ev cars were in short supply but that they should be able to source something and would let me know. Guess what - no contact from them and I ended up calling them this morning. Something must have been wrong, as I only had to wait 15 minutes before connecting with the branch, who actually answered this time without putting the phone down immediately. They advised that Motability had contacted them to cancel the contract due to \"a lack of suitable vehicle availability\". They LIED - I contacted Motability RAC who checked their records and advised that it was EUROPCAR who had cancelled, not them. The RAC then took new details, and I am now waiting to hear back from Europcar for a new loan car. This of course, has directly impacted on not only me, but the dealership as they now do not have a car to repair.\n\nThis company is APPALING and I'd suggest that anyone looking to hire a vehicle avoids Europcar like the plague."

      "text": "From start to finish, one of the worst experiences with a company I have ever had. It's hard to know where to begin to be honest, but suffice to say I will never, ever, be using Europcar again.\n\nFor a start, I was give a completely different car to what I ordered. I prefer a smaller car for easier parking and I was pressured into taking a fairly large SUV. Generally the experience with the car during the rental was ok. However, when I returned it, there was no one around and no spaces in any of the bays. There was one space in another company's area, but of course all the bays were tiny (although the same as Europcars) and I struggled to park it, which was an unbelievably stressful experience.\n\nTwo weeks later, I was sent an invoice for £331!! According to Europcar I left a scratch on the car (which I didn't see at the time and to be honest, I'm still skeptical it may have occurred by someone else moving it because when I called up the next day after returning the car the Europcar rep said everything was fine and the charge on my credit card was dropped).\n\nFurious about the whole situation, I complained and was told an investigation was underway. For several months I heard nothing, and assumed it had been dropped. Only to then receive an email from their solicitors requesting the money, with a £40 late fee and an order to pay within 14 days or risk legal proceedings. Of course I have tried and tried to find a solution via email and on the phone, but in the end it's like talking to a wall so I decided to pay the invoice to avoid this dragging on any further.\n\nNow I am in trouble because my cover only reimburses cases if their claim is made 45 days from the day of the rental. This is a separate company, but this situation would have been avoided had they contacted me about the investigation earlier.\n\nAs said, this has been truly awful and this review barely scratches the surface. I feel completely robbed, and mistreated but I suppose they don't care because they have their money."

I wasn’t able to get hold of a Jerry Can I tried multiple times. Not much I can do the do expect risk being caught driving with no insurance. I explained this to the man and he said that’s fine. I will explain. I then wake up on the Saturday to find they had took A full tank of fuel out of my account and they wasn’t even concerned that they had cancelled the insurance basically saying to me that I should have drove the vehicle uninsured when at the top of my road there is an ANPR camera that would’ve flagged no insurance and they would’ve been quick enough to send the police to my door disgusting behaviour considering it was a courtesy car whilst my mums mobility car was off-road. They would’ve been happy for it to fall back on my shoulders driving uninsured meaning I could have potentially been put on a driving ban or worse time in jail. I will be lodging a formal complaint. This is just that everyone knows that you like to cancel insurances. By the looks of it it is an shocking company with really bad reviews so I’m not overly surprised to be honest with their behaviour, if I could avoid using them I would, but unfortunately mobility only work with them so in need of a replacement vehicle I am stuck with them"

It is what has happened after drop off which I can only suggest borders on criminal. So far a payment authorisation each week of £139 has been taken against my debit card after returning the van two weeks ago. I can only suggest that they continue to use the initial card authorisation I gave them when approving the deposit to be held. Their representatives can’t see why they would be taking this amount each week as there is nothing on the rental agreement suggesting they should but it doesn’t stop it from coming out of my account and depleting my available funds somewhat illegally. I have had to open a case and been asked to send them statements so that they can investigate. In addition to this they also tried to charge for fuel when I had filled it up just before dropping off which the chap at the drop off desk reminded me to do. No exaggeration the petrol station is next door as they share the car park. They have since said a refund is coming back to me for this due to “lack of documentation” but it’s pretty shameful that someone thought to try it on to start. Fingers crossed they sort the weekly illegal card authorisations without me needing to cancel my cards with the bank."

Luckily I had taken a video of the condition of the car inside and out, and there was no damage when I left it at the dealership. A few days after I dropped the hire car at the garage, Europcar finally collected it and yet did not mention any damage, in fact they sent a video they took on collection and the car looks fine *although having compared their footage to mine, they had taken the video after driving it as the fuel gauge was slightly less than as I left it.\n\nThe notification from Europcar was sent by text message and there is no option to reply.\n\nA call to their customer services ended up with someone in Morocco who refused to clarify what the damage apparently is, stating it is not relevant, they also refused to put me through to a supervisor or manager or arrange a callback from them. I felt entirely at the mercy of someone who simply told me they were investigating!\nEither this is a scam or Europcar are attempting to charge customers for unspecified 'damage' to vehicles, weeks after they are returned!"

At pickup I was immediately offered 2 different cars than my original reservation, my first question was “will these cost more”, the response was “no”. I signed paperwork whichI should have paid more attention to but was assured it was just a few initials to complete reservation and insurance details. After I dropped the vehicle off my American Express was charged an additional $926. American Express took the case but I have only received my $395 back. I was therefore charged an extra $531 for this rental: RENTER BEWARE OF SNAKE-OIL SALESMEN AT THIS LOCATION…..\nFLEECED!!!!!"

An arranged hire car through motability was delivered to me at the dealership which quarter the fuel tank had been used when I received it. No paperwork or anything was signed. She handed keys, I took photos of the car as proof there was scrape marks on the vehicle already. The woman who delivered it seemed a little edgy. I used the hire car a handful of times and then filled it back up to where it was when I handed the keys. I dropped it at the dealership and the recptionist told me she would arrange the collection for me and she took the keys off me. A WEEK later I had notification It had been collected by Europcar. They then billed me for £30 fuel used!! I disputed this but then became too tired to continue and paid it, stupidly. Now 2 MONTHS later they have filed a claim against me for damage to the vehicle!! I am being chased for £100 excess for damage I DID NOT do. The damage in question was already on the vehicle when I was handed the keys. I took photos of the car when I dropped it off and uploaded them onto the Europcar link they had sent me. So they DO have the photos before and after showing the exact same damage already there and no further damages. UNLESS, the dealership had caused damage between the week of me dropping it off and Europcar collecting it. Either way, I did NOT cause any damage what so ever, or the delivery woman damaged it on the way to dropping it off as apparently no damage was recorded before I had it. convenient!!! I refuse to pay for someone elses damage. NOT a chance. I will take this all way the way and as far as it goes. They uploaded their own images and I uploded my images to them. So they have the images I sent them regardless. They are liars, unprofessional money grabbers preying on motability customers. DO NOT ACCEPT EUROPCAR HIRE."

The following Monday I had to drive from my home in Cornwall to Gloucestershire with my cat who was going to a specialist hospital for treatment, while I stayed nearby in a B&B.\n\nEuropcar Truro texted me on the Monday saying that my hire car would be delivered between 12 and 2. I had bee trying to call them all morning to bring it forward as I had to be in Gloucester by 5pm. They don’t answer this phones. They don’t even play music or have a message telling you that you are in aqueue….they just play you an advertisement over and over.\n\nMy insurance company did manage to contact them though, and Europcar called me shortly before 2pm. They told me that an MGHS has bee booked out to me and was on its way. This car never arrived. I then received another text saying that my car would be with me between 3 and 5. Shortly before 6pm the driver turned up with the smaller MGZS. I wasn’t able to fit all of my luggage plus cat crate into this so I had to leave some things behind.\n\nReturning the hire car is proving to be similarly difficult., largely because EuRopcar never answer their phones. I tried to call them several times during the week to talk to the about the return, but they don’t answer. As I am typing my insurer is also attempting to contact them. The have promised to call the, back, but that was over an hour ago. If I can’t return the cat today I am going to have to pay for another night at the B&B and another night for the cat at the veterinary hospital. I have also tried to call the Bristol branch to see if I can drop the car off there but they don’t answer either, and after 20 minutes of listening to their advent they cut you off with a message that just says “ sorry there is no one here to answer you call”.\n\nThey treat human beings with contempt. I am disabled and things like this have a very negative effect on my physical health. I hope that NFU Mutual and other car insurers will stop using them. Had I known that they would cause me this many problems I would have hired a car from somewhere else at my own expense."

After the closure was lifted, we were not able to ignite the car again. This was some time around 8 pm. After calling the Europcar service, it took 2 hours for the technician to arrive. Apparently the immobilizer was active, some kind of software malfunction, happening for reasons not even he could explain. We were ready to go again some minutes before midnight, lost therefore our hotel reservation, where check in was till 10pm only. Our flight back home was the next morning and since we were scared this might happen again, we decided to return directly to Edinburgh Airport spending the rest of the night (arrival time was after 1am) at the parking lot. Needless to emphasize the inconvenience caused.\n\nDue to this, it seemed adequate to ask for a refund for the caused trouble, since if any fault is caused by the costumer Europcar would not hesitate to bill the extra expenditures. But all we got offered was a lousy 10% discount on our next booking. An offer like this + the fact, that europcar is expanding its fleet with low quality chinese cars will make us seriously rethink renting anytime again from Europcar.\n\nI for myself cannot recommend renting with them."

The staff member had not printed his name on the form (as required) but did sign to say he had explained the extra product to me - he never mentioned it!

At the car return they said we cannot help but contact head office again and you will get a refund.

Not trustworthy at all!\n\nEuropcar responded by suggesting that I give them \"a chance to solve the issue\" by contacting their customer service. This is their standard response and sounds good - except I have already exchanged several emails with their customer service dept - they started off offering to help, but in the end said they would not refund the money wrongly charged.

      "text": "The original problem with Europcar happened May 18 but was in conjunction with Mercedes and carried on for 5 months. Europcar had a simple task - to deliver a hire car to a Mercedes dealership in Pembroke where we waiting as our car needed attention. All agreed at noon and advised ETA of 14-20 pm. No car had arrived at 15-30 so obviously called to enquire. Told that they would contact the driver to confirm ETA. The news was somewhat baffling - no car had been dispatched and this was down to Mercedes not approving the order. Their suggestion was that a taxi would take us to Swansea - a trip of say 2 hours - and we could then drive back to our hotel - another 90 mins. We obviously declined the offer and our hire car eventually arrived at our hotel Sunday mid morning. Over the next 5 months dealing with Mercedes Benz Customer Service, it became very clear that the excuse about the non arrival of the car being down to MB was a complete lie. So Europcar came up with another excuse. That also was a complete lie. But good luck to Europcar they just kept going and came up with another excuse this time blaming us that our credit card details had not arrived in time. Hey,ho in seconds we managed to send visual evidence that this third attempt was also a lie. In the end, MB after 5 months of deliberation finally, finally realised that they were being lied to and the case was\nsorted in our favour. In a way, I was a little disappointed when it ended because it was just fascinating to try and guess what Europcar would create as their next excuse. Bad ethics, no apologies - Europcar is a Company to avoid at all costs. There are lots of hire companies out there and my advise is to choose any other than Europcar. Very easy to see why their customer ratings are so low. Almost impossible to try and fathom why Mercedes has chosen them as a partner. Apologies for long note - cathartic...\n\nGot the standard response from Europcar giving me an email address to respond. Tried that and the address is blocked. You just could not make this stuff up.

Monday morning 28th at 8.45am I received a call from Europcar to say someone will be in touch within 24hr hours regarding getting me back ok the road, Tuesday 29th lunchtime arrived no call, I spent ages on hold for upto 20minutes before being disconnected and had to call back, I was finally told at 2pm a car would be delivered 6pm that day, 5.30pm (30minutes before my allocation delivery time) I missed a call as was at work, a voicemail was left to say this has been pushed back to Wednesday 30th and someone would call me, I have spent all morning trying to contact the team whilst trying to enjoy a planned day out with my children to be told again someone will call me back but after again waiting, I called them myself at 6.40pm, after being passed from person to person to be told surprise surprise this has again been pushed back to Thursday 31st and I will receive yet another call even though I am the one who has been chasing them. I am now approaching day 4 without a car. I am unsure why when my loan car is being dealt with and coming from Liverpool branch they have no car available yet if I go on their website there is around 6/8 that would be suitable for collection. I have 3 children one of which registered disabled and told I will not be left without a vehicle well unfortunately this was false information and I have been left with no car!"

      "text": "I hired a car through easyjet at the cost of £244 and thus included premium insurance. When I went to pick car up from Glasgow Airport branch I was scammed from the minute I walked through the door. The young chap with a beard didn't even want to see my car hire voucher as he said he had it on his computer. Asked what car I drove normally I said an automatic as I have rhymathoid arthritis but for a week I would only need a manual which I had booked. Told me he would give me an automatic at no extra cost as I had a disability also said my daughter could be an additional driver in case I wasn't able to drive while I was visiting family. I did sign a form after he said it was a holding deposit which would all be returned after I dropped car off( they took £903 out my account). He folded up paper and put into envelope I made a point in say you haven't charged me any extra have you as my reading eyesight isn't good. Reply not at all madam. Enjoy your stay, dropped car off flowing Monday 14th Oct . Next day I found out they had taken out £653 out of my account for upgrade, young driver addition my daughter is 25. I have complained and told that because I signed it's my fault. They have scammed me out of this money by playing on my disability and poor reading eyesight. So I have just paid £900 for a hire car for a week which is absolutely terrifying. I could have got taxis everywhere cheaper than this. It is shocking what people are prepared to do to vulnerable people who are honest and hardworking. Glasgow branch seems to be good at doing this. I will never use or recommend them ever again. If I don't get my money back I will contact watchdog and the ombudsman. Playing on someone's disability is shocking. If I could I would give them zero stars"

      "text": "Awful experience.\nIncorrect size van. Painful time consuming process to get a van anywhere close to the size I booked. Charged for excess miles after inaccurate pick up miles recorded.\nNeeded to move furniture 2.45m in length. Booked a medium size van internal length 2.93m on website. Went on live chat to confirm that if it was a “similar van” it would still be the same internal length.\nWas told the length on the website was an error, but all their medium vans are 2.862m so it would be that.\nI was emailed less than 2 days before pick up, after free cancellation period advising the van was 1.75m. This was below the amount I needed so called customer services. They said this is an error and I would get the van I needed. Contacted the Norwich office to double check, they said it was extremely unlikely they’d have a van I needed, but would “upgrade” me to a larger van. The larger van was no use, as in excess of the maximum weight limit for my licence. This was initially dismissed, then accepted that this was correct, I was told I would get a smaller van. I asked to confirm that this would be a minimum of 2.5m in internal length, they said they couldn’t guarantee this. I explained that it has to be 2.5m or it’s not use to me. I was told they’d call me back. Six hours later following receiving no call back I chased. Was told they had managed to get a van and it would be 2.5m in length. A total of 7 calls and 45 minutes on the phone.\nPicked up the van fine, no issue with the van, it was 2.5m in length, although not the 2.862m I had initially booked. This meant due to the angle the seats came out at I needed to do an extra trip as the furniture needed to be on its back rather than on its side, so only 1 could fit at a time rather than 2. This added 2 hours and 45 miles to my day.\nI could have ignored all this, but to top it off.\nReturned the van and was emailed a statement of return. The pick up miles were incorrect. I contacted to explain and sent a photo as evidence. I was told that it didn’t matter as they hadn’t been charged. The following day I received an invoice confirming the charge for the miles which I didn’t drive."

Not sure how but they missed off 2 scratches the full length of the passenger side doors which looked to be made by a key, the rear bumper had multiple scratches and chips and 2 of the alloys were heavily scuffed. I rang to report and emailed the photos but I’m in no doubt they would have tried to charge me for this if I’d not done so.\nI filled the car up on the day of return and dropped it off at Crewe Audi who made the booking, I took a date/time stamped picture of a full tank with 520 miles. I’ve now received an invoice for £15+ for 7 litres of fuel and when I’ve queried it they told me I’ve been charged for the fuel to get the car back to their Stoke on Trent branch!! Not sure why I’m responsible for this given it was returned with the same fuel level and they’ve also added their inflated petrol fee.\nAvoid this company and use Enterprise. If a dealership books a car through Europcar be sure to make the dealership take ownership or refuse it."

The worst of big corporate company behaviour taking advantage of the average customer. Avoid at all costs. To be precise a 3cm superficial, barely visible scratch which they alleged I had caused was charged at approximately 1300 Euros, showed a UK specialist who's stated it should cost maximum £500 . I very much doubt it will be repaired they just take the money. It really feels like I've been scammed. After over a month of emails in which all of their responses were callous and didn't answer my very polite questions, after already extorting 1500 euros, they are still taking more money from my credit card and I'm having to go to the ombudsman just to stop them after trying with the company for over a month. The ombudsman, the ECRCS, found they had mistakenly charged me VAT on the damage - Europcar then took another £1100 from my credit card without refunding me the first charge of £1382. Honestly I didn't find the ombudsman helpful, it felt like they were sponsored by the care hire company. Just don't use Europcar whatever you do they essentially are using any excuse to extort money and you are powerless to stop them.\nUnbelievable"

      "text": "One of the Most Stressful Car Hire Experiences I've Ever Had - I am all for the change over to electric cars, per say, but by choice and not on this occassion...!\nI recently hired a car from Europcar, and it turned out to be one of the most stressful experiences I've ever had. I originally booked a Vauxhall but, to my surprise, was given a fully electric Jeep instead. No one informed me of this change beforehand—there was no notice in my email or on the order. To make matters worse, I was charged an extra £35.\nWhen I arrived to collect the car, I was told there were no other vehicles available, and one of the staff rudely suggested I should just cancel my order. I had an important meeting over 220 miles away and had no choice but to take the car. I had no idea how it worked, and the staff didn’t have a clue either. They didn’t know how many miles I could drive or how to charge it, but they incorrectly assured me that 200 miles would be enough to get me to my destination.\nAfter just 30 miles of driving, and when I figured a couple of things out, I realized the mileage was dropping much faster than expected, and I found myself in a panic, with only 43 miles left and 35 miles to go to the nearest charging station. I called Europcar twice for help and was left on hold for 20 and then 35 minutes! I ended up having to call a local dealership to get information about charging the car, who were so helpful and supportive.\nDespite calling Europcar multiple times to ask for a different vehicle, I was told they couldn’t get through to other branches, and I didn’t have time to go hours out of my way to try Plymouth or Exeter locations. I was late to my meeting and to my hotel in Cirencester, which left me stressed and anxious.\nThe next day, the nightmare continued. The car was at 15% charge in the morning, but I had to drive slowly and risk running out of charge just to make it to my next meeting. Afterward, I drove to two charging stations that were both not working (Shell). I had to go to a third location, which took 20 mins to get to and an hour to charge, and I ended up driving in the dark—a situation that made me even more anxious. I didn’t get home until 9:45 PM, completely exhausted.\nI wouldn’t have rented this car if I had been told about the change in advance. The potential breach of contract, misrepresentation, lack of communication, rude staff, and complete lack of knowledge about the vehicle made this an awful experience. I felt unsafe throughout the journey, constantly worried about the mileage and being stranded with no charge. This hire wasted my time, energy, and money. Absolutely terrible service, and I feel upset by how badly this was handled and hope this can be redressed.\nEuropcar needs to seriously improve their obligation to customer service and communication. If you're thinking of hiring from them, I would advise you to double-check your booking and be prepared for a lot of hassle.\n\nWould not recommend."

I refused it as I needed an SUV for all my family's luggage, baby equipment etc, but was told there were none available. This was not true as there was a Toyota RAV 4 SUV parked right outside. They reluctantly gave it to me and after about 100 kms it broke down. I had to return 100 kms to Marseille to pick up a replacement even though there were other nearer branches. They again tried to offer me a Renault Mégane! After a long argument I was finally given an MG SUV. The counter staff were unbelievably rude and the final cost to me was nearly 40% more than expected. I have been hiring cars at Marseille airport for over 35 years and never had a problem, but I have previously used reputable companies like Avis. Never again, don't touch EuropCar."

At no point were we verbally made aware of any additional charges, nor were we made aware in the confirmation email that additional charges may apply for the additional driver, and when we asked about the breakdown of the costs on the rental agreement we were told \"this summarises what you've already paid\". Fast forward a week and an additional charge appears on my credit card for 28% of the original rental costs for the additional driver.\n\nWhen we've challenged the cost, despite not being made aware of the additional cost, it was included on the rental agreement and therefore Europcar are unwilling to refund. Why would these costs not be mentioned to us when we specifically asked their representative what the costs were? To add salt to the wound, the additional driver was just for an emergency, they didn't even drive the vehicle.\n\nIn the interest of customer service would you not empathise with the customer, understand the facts they have presented, and determine a miscommunication had occurred?"

Eight days ago, a reservation was made on my behalf by the Direct Line Motability team, but I am still without a vehicle. Despite this ongoing delay, it is frustrating to see that Europcar has vehicles available online for casual customers, allowing them to book and pick up cars at very short notice.\n\nThis raises serious concerns about Europcar’s commitment to Motability customers. It seems that Europcar is accepting reservations through the Motability team without actually having the vehicle stock available, while prioritizing casual customers who book online. This is not only unacceptable but reflects poorly on the company’s ability to serve those who rely on such schemes for their independence and mobility, particularly drivers with disabilities.\n\nThe lack of communication and transparency around vehicle availability, especially after waiting for more than a week, has caused significant inconvenience and stress. As a disabled veteran, reliable transportation is crucial for my day-to-day life, and this experience has greatly impacted my ability to manage my commitments.\n\nI strongly urge Europcar to address this issue, both in how they manage stock for Motability reservations and in how they prioritize these customers. It is unacceptable for vehicles to be available to casual customers while Motability customers are left waiting indefinitely.\n\nDarlington Branch"

Left the kiosk asking them to call us when they know more, not only did they not call us it took 3 days for their customer services team to even acknowledge our email, saying they couldnt look into our complaint until the rental period was over!!

However, after travelling for miles to collect the vehicle, we were told that our investigative journalist could not take the van because he wasn't on the electoral roll.\n\nWhy on earth would they allow us to proceed with the booking, travel such a long distance, only to turn us away upon arrival? It wasted an entire day, time we didn’t have to spare, all for nothing. Now, we’re left waiting for a refund that has taken days to process, with no van, no solution, and a serious disruption to our event plans.\n\nMy biggest regret was not checking the reviews on here first! Had I seen the experiences others have had, we would never have booked with Europcar in the first place. Thankfully, a local company stepped in last minute to save the day, but the way Europcar handled this situation was absolutely shocking. The lack of communication and care is beyond frustrating. I strongly urge anyone considering renting from Europcar to think again. Don’t waste your time, energy, or money – their service is abysmal!\n\nAnd Europcar, don’t come at us with the generic response of “we’ll look into this for you” – whatever you are doing is a scam, if not of people's money, their valuable time!"

Use the £20 for public transport instead.\n\nI was foolish enough to rent a vehicle from them. I now realise this is not a reputable company but rather a rolling scam—a front for financial abuse masked as fair policy. Whatever you pay in advance, regardless of the booking mediator you use, rest assured, it won’t be the final price. The car you want won’t be available, the cover you obtain through a booking mediator will be ignored, and you’ll be charged for additional coverage (even if you insist you’re already covered).\n\nEffectively, here’s what will happen: you’ll arrive to collect the car you booked. Europcar won’t have it. They’ll offer you a shed on wheels and claim it’s similar to what you reserved. It won’t be. They will then offer an upgrade at an exorbitant rate, trapping you because you need a car to make your holiday work. Then, they’ll place a temporary hold on your card, and for weeks after returning the car, they’ll bombard you with invoices for additional costs at inflated prices.\n\nEuropcar is about as transparent as sandblasted glass covered in treacle."

Once he started to be rude then his colleague put the speaker off !! Then I left the place with big disappointment as never had this before anywhere !!! So be careful before booking a car with them as they can confirm your booking online but once you arrive their office then they can say sorry we can't hire you a car !!!

This has been the most diabolical customer service I have ever received by a long way. Word from the wise avoid Europcar or face getting blatantly ripped off.\n**Update: I patiently wait for your response, you suggested I email customer services which I have twice so far with no reply, add that to the 40 emails I have sent to your customer services already trying to. sort out the excessive fees and poor customer service**\nAbsolutely appalling from start to finish. Terrible customer service with only a premium line to call costing me a large additional sum. Incorrect car provided with additional costs amounting to well over £400. I complained directly with diabolical correspondence from them in return and no resolution. I will never use them again and strongly advise the same. Only giving one star as negatives not possible."

A new Manager started a month or so back, and whole atmosphere has changed, refusing to extend when I’d never had issues before, grudgingly giving me a higher category car when they were short vehicles ( like he was doing me a favour) and today, TWO days after returning a car to Heathrow - and less than a month after finishing a three week rental with his branch, got rejected by ID /credit checks. Did NOTHING to solve the issue despite there being no issue 6 days ago. Could have resolved it if wanted to as staff do on a daily basis ( calling head office could have been one step) Now have to wait 3-14 days for refund. Went to SIXT at the station and 15 mins later was driving a rental from there. It’s called Customer Service. Cancelled my booking in two weeks and will NEVER book a car thru them again whilst this manager is in place. Too much ego and drama."

Multiple employees stated “we do not know what that means” but that there was “nothing they can do about it”. Without so much as an apology, I was told they couldn’t give me a car, it wasn’t their problem and they couldn’t resolve it. To top it off - no refund! Since I booked via a third party, the refund has to be claimed through them (and that has a minimum 20 working day resolution but that’s another issue…).\n\nSo there I was, with no car, no refund and no compensation. Trip had to (obviously) be changed at my expense & travel back to my house had to be purchased (since the plan was to drive back in the hire car!).\n\nNo explanation yet received, though emails sent to an address provided to a team “that can maybe see the issue”.\n\nAll in all, an expensive and depressing waste of time.\nMy recommendation is to find a different hire company!"

I put 9 litres in which I presume was tie fuel used by their driver to go to Woking from Heathrow where the depot is. When I returned the car to Guildford Audi I filled the car with fuel, so I returned it with more fuel in than when I got it. They didn’t pick it up from Audi for 3 days. Later on I got a charge on my credit card for refuelling of £16. When I questioned this, they said I had to pay for the fuel their driver used to go back to the depot!! Unbelievable.

      "text": "Please beware! Paid £1,400 for a £580 Europcar Rental: Misleading Deposits and Hidden Insurance Costs\n\nI initially booked a 2-week rental for what seemed like a great price—£237 in total. The pick-up process went smoothly, and I was asked to pay a “deposit,” which I was told would be refunded if the car was returned intact. However, at no point did the staff mention any additional costs beyond what I had already paid online.\n\nFast forward to the end of the two weeks—I needed to extend my rental, but it wasn’t possible. No big deal; I returned the car and booked another one for £343. This time, I noticed that they had sneakily added a £30 per day insurance premium. To my shock, this same hidden charge had been applied to my first rental as well, even though it was never communicated to me.\n\nNow, here’s the real kicker: the so-called “deposit” isn’t a deposit at all! They cleverly call it that to make you think you’ll get the full amount back, but in reality, they deduct the insurance charges from it. It’s a deliberate tactic to keep the insurance cost as hidden as possible until it’s too late.\n\nWhen I asked if I could opt out of the insurance, they refused to give me a car and would not refund the £300+ I had already paid. In the end, what was meant to be a straightforward car rental turned into a financial nightmare. For four weeks of car rental, I spent £580 on the online booking, plus an outrageous £800+ on insurance, bringing the total to nearly £1,400.\n\nIt’s clear that Europcar’s strategy is to lure customers with attractive online rates, and then, after you’ve paid the non-refundable fee, hit you with surprise insurance charges—last minute—leaving you with no choice but to accept. If insurance is mandatory, why isn’t it included in the advertised price so that customers can make an informed decision? This is blatant false advertising.\n\nEuropcar has lost me as a customer forever, and I strongly advise anyone to steer clear of this company. In all fairness, the cars themselves are clean and good, but their deceptive, scheming practices make for a truly awful experience."

The young lad was helpful but immediately went off and returned with two Mercedes keys and told me I could have them instead at a discount. I told him that I wanted the car I had ordered but with the basic insurance. In the end that car wasn’t available so I had a free upgrade. So far so good.\nI repeated about my basic insurance requirements. He then went through the costs. I told him I didn’t want roadside assistance but he told me that was part of the package. I should have questioned him further on the package but he was nice and helpful so I signed the contract. Later when I read it closely I realised I had paid for premium insurance. I have now complained but have been told I have to wait until the hire has finished before I can complain. I now have the feeling the whole thing is a well rehearsed con to get the client to pay for higher insurance. Reassure the customer you have his best interests, focus on the free upgrade, gloss over questions on insurance and then stick him with premium cover. No doubt I will get no rebate later when I complain again.\nBottom line is to be very suspicious. If you suspect they are trying to cheat you they probably are."

Spoke to customer service who said that the branch have told them that the verification had failed and availability wasn't the issue. What a lie!! We didn't even get to licence etc because there was no car. They found one after about an hour but it was due a recall. They wasted my time and money!! Would not want to use this company ever again. Please be aware and don't trust them. You cannot rely on their customer service to use common sense and solve issues."

I have rented cars for over 45 years and have NEVER been scammed like this.\n\nOn arrival the woman at the desk tried to make me upgrade the car - making it appear that that was the one l been allocated (she already had the key on the desk infront of her). I refused and said l wanted the car l had booked.\n\nNext, premium insurance was added to my contract without asking me. As a result, l paid 150% more on my originally booking price. I have annual excess insurance and never use the rental company insurance went l rent.\n\nThey hid the fact that insurance was added by including it in the credit card excess authisation. Therefore, you are unaware that you have purchased insurance until your card is charged after the rental. Look at the reviews, many others have been scammed in this way.\n\nWhen I asked if the car had any damaged, l was told that it wasn't necessary to check it. On return, it was a different story, with the attendant checking the car minutely - going around it several times. In the end he found a very small scratch and l was required to sign off on the damage. I cannot say if the damage was already done when l rented the car. The scratch was so small l do not believe l would have noticed it ... and certainly not in poor light conditions.\n\nIf you use this company you should make sure that you photograph the whole car, including wheels, before you drive off.\n\nNever again!"

Why is the director of this company conncected to Bentley cars when i looked up companys house ? its time motability supplied each paying customer of motability with cars direct from the garage doing there repair . it is also time all people if they have a alergic reaction to something or need a service dog to supply cars to the disabled while there cars are being repaired without this threat hanging over them of having unlawful amounts taken from there accounts . Are motability and all garages including audi aware that under the equality act 2010 they are serving the public they are obliged to make arrangements to accomodate disabled customers . and that service and assistance dogs are used to help and make disabled peoples lifes more bearable in many different ways . and there is no test no colour of harness colour no paperwork or certificate and they should all be catered for and listened to . the system using diabolical companys needs to be ended now ."

I live 16 miles from the airport, so someone gave me a lift to the airport to collect the vehicle (had to also pay the Newcastle Airport drop off charge (£4) to be dropped off in car park near the terminal!\nI went to the Europcar desk in the terminal only to find no one there. Instead, there was a notice saying that the desk was closed and that they were operating from a cabin in the car rental car park at the opposite end of the airport!\nOn arrival at the new Europcar location I was asked for my license which I presented. I also offered to give them my passport and proof of address which they declined (said they didn’t need them)!\nAfter 10 minutes the person behind the desk asked me to confirm my address which I did, and I was then told that Europcar had declined my reservation and that they could not give me the car I had booked and paid for! In fact, they couldn’t give me any vehicle!\nWhen I sought clarification, I was told that their system had not been able to verify my address which by the way is on my licence and I also had additional proof of address with me but this was not acceptable as the “system had declined” my paid for in full confirmed reservation!\nI spoke to the manager who said he could do nothing nor could he refund the money I had already paid as it had been collected by AutoEurope and I would have to take it up with them!\nHe also astounded me with a tale of how Europcar was clamping down on who they hired cars to because some had not been returned and others had been used in robberies etc and as a result of these unacceptable comment and inferences I was left feeling as though I was some sort of undesirable crook!\nIf that wasn’t bad enough this whole experience caused me a great deal of embarrassment as it was done in front of other customers including the bit about cars used in robberies etc hence the clampdown on who Europcar would hire vehicles to!\nI again challenged them and said that I’d been hiring cars for more than 40 years including with Europcar and never had any problems and was then told that I was the 3rd person in a row who the system had rejected, and that the manager was going to raise a query in the company’s group chat to see if other branches were having the same problem. Not that this helped my situation!\nUltimately not only was I was unable to hire vehicle but I was also left stranded at the airport and had to take a taxi from the airport back to South Shields to pick up an alternative hire vehicle from a local car hire company before they shut at 1pm.\nThis whole experience has proved far from acceptable and its unlikely that I will use AutoEurope again despite having used them many times previously but I certainly will not be using or indeed recommending Europcar again, in fact quite the opposite – I strongly advise anyone thinking of using Europcar to think long and hard about it and certainly don’t assume that you have a confirmed reservation.\nBased on my experience, not only will it prove to be a costly exercise, but it’s also an experience you are likely to regret!\nIf by any chance you are foolish enough to try and book with Europcar than I strongly suggest you put an alternative back up plan in place too, because based on my experience you are more than likely going to need to fall back on it!"

At the airport counter, the agent informed me that since I already had insurance with full coverage, I did not need to subscribe to any additional insurance. I was also told that a deposit of 700 euros would be charged (something I was already aware of through the contract signed with e-Dreams). In good faith, I signed the required forms on the tablet (the amount indicated was £647, which I believed to be the deposit) and was given a document with the rental and payment details; nothing else was handed to me, nor sent via email (certainly not an insurance policy that might have raised some suspicions).\nAfter two months of waiting for the refund of what I thought was the deposit, I was informed, upon my inquiry, that no refund would be issued as the amount charged corresponded to the cost of the insurance I had supposedly subscribed to. Realizing I had signed a document without verifying that the amount (which was not specified) actually consisted of £100 for the deposit and £546 for the insurance policy (this was the final amount charged), I nonetheless filed a complaint with customer service. Their prompt response (only 21 minutes after my email!) stated that since it was impossible to verify what had been discussed verbally, only the signed document held any validity! It goes without saying that all the information regarding the costs and charges was written in such a small font that one would need not just a pair of glasses but a magnifying glass!"

I was surprised to later receive a damage report claiming that I had damaged the vehicle. This report contained my signature, but no damage was brought to my attention when I returned the car, nor was I shown any documentation or proof of the alleged damage at the time.\n\nIn an effort to resolve the matter, I sent several emails to your customer service team seeking clarification. However, the only responses I received were automated emails apologizing for the delay and requesting my continued patience during your investigation. Months passed without any meaningful communication.\n\nTwo months after the incident, I sent the following email to inquire about the status of the investigation:\n\n-----\nDear Customer Service Team,\nI am writing to you again to resolve the following issue. We have not received any communication except for two messages stating:\nDear Customer,\nThank you for your continued patience during our investigation.\nPlease accept our sincere apologies for the delay in responding to you, due to the nature of your query; it is taking slightly longer than usual. It is our aim to provide you a full and thorough resolution, including any necessary supporting documentation.\nWe would like to offer you our assurances that once the information we are seeking has been obtained, we will respond to you. In the meantime, thank you for your continued patience in regards to this matter.\nWe look forward to contacting you again in the near future.\nCould you please advise on the status of this issue?\n-----\n\nDespite my best efforts, this email went unanswered. Instead, I was contacted by Shakespeare Martineau LLP Clients Account, a debt collection firm, which was both intimidating and unexpected, given that no final resolution had been communicated to me regarding the alleged damage.\n\nIn August, I finally received a response from Europcar stating that \"a member of our team will review your query and reply accordingly.\" However, no action followed this, and on June 10th, I received another email stating that you would not be pursuing any third-party providers and would be billing me directly.\n\nAs you can see, I have received numerous conflicting and contradictory communications from Europcar throughout this process. This is not only highly unprofessional but also confusing and distressing.\n\nUnder the Consumer Rights Act 2015, I am entitled to clear and transparent information regarding any charges or claims made against me, as well as reasonable communication in the resolution of any disputes. Europcar has failed in this regard, breaching your obligation to provide services with reasonable care and skill as required under Section 49 of the Act.\n\nFurthermore, the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 outlines that it is illegal for companies or third parties to engage in intimidating or unfair practices. The involvement of a debt collection firm in this unresolved matter, without following your own procedures, raises concerns about the fairness of this process.\n\nI find it unacceptable that Europcar has escalated this matter to a debt collector instead of adhering to the process stipulated in your terms and conditions. I request that this issue be resolved in accordance with the law and your own procedures."

We were given a well battered yellow BMW with all damaged listed on the agreement, I double checked with the desk before we left. On return, as is the way we were in a dash to get to the airport. The guy looked at the wheel hub and said that's new damage. I said no look it's listed on the rental agreement right there its old damage, and gave him the agreement. Also told him I'd checked it with the guys it was listed before i took it out. HE DID NOT LOOK AT THE AGREEMENT AND KEPT OUR PAPER RENTAL AGREEMENT (my second mistake). My first being that i didn't think it necessary to take pictures of the damage as it was already listed and checked. He then took photos and put them on the release which he insisted I sign. I asked if he would verify with the pictures from previous hirers so he could see it was not my doing, he mumbled something which I assumed stupidly was a yes. Now two months later I've just received notification I will be required to pay for the damage. I regard this behaviour as down right dishonest and disreputable and will never hire from them again. Good lesson in how to ruin someone's holiday memories. Thanks but never ever again."

      "text": "********* ORIGINAL POST ***********\n9/25/2014\nBEWARE!!!! BEWARE!!!! You have been warned. Horrible experience with EuropCar UK. I rented a car through Booking.com. When we arrived, they told us they didn’t have the car that we requested/paid for prior and they were going to upgrade us. They upgraded all right. On top of the $700 we already paid through booking.com they charged another $1200. They told me the initial $700 was included in the $1200 so I only had a $500 upcharge. I asked why there was any upcharge since they did not have the car I booked. I was told because I reserved the car through booking .com and not through them it would not be a free upgrade that I could go back to booking.com and request a different car or upgrade to this one at a cost. I am standing at the airport with 4 other people and didn’t have many options at the moment so we elected to pay the difference for the upgrade. Little did I know they charge me $1200 on top of the initial $700 I had already paid. I was not aware of this until AFTER my trip. Now that the car was dropped off they charged me another $400 to replace a tire because there was a minor cut in the side of the tire. This is the same tire that had previous damage noted on the rental contract. Where the cut was and the size of it you could not see it depending how the car is parked. When I returned it the cut was in the 1:00 o’clock position on the tire and easily visible. If the car is parked with the tire between 4:00 – 8:00 o’clock position you can not see the defect. At any rate I was charged $400 to replace the tire that only had about 60% remaining tread left on the tire. All in all it was a horrible experience with them and I will never use them again.\n\n******** UPDATED **********\n9/29/2024\nReached out to their generic response. Let's see what they do about the issue.\n\n******** UPDATED **********\n9/30/2024\nResponse from Customer Service\nThank you for contacting Europcar Customer Services.\n\nI can confirm the rental station will offer additional optional products to our customers upon their arrival at the desk, to ensure they are aware of all the products and services available. It is then the customer’s decision to accept or decline the products offered to them.\n\nWhilst I appreciate you have stated that the upgrade charge was not agreed to, I would be unable to comment further as I was not part of the verbal discussion. When the two parties involved are providing conflicting information, I can only base my decision by the documented evidence available.\n\nAs the rental agreement and Additional Optional Products form have been signed, in acceptance of the product, the request for the charge to be refunded has been respectfully declined.\n\nRegards,\nOmar Amoifek"

After a flight, kids in tow etc etc, we took a video of the car upon collection just to show the current condition. Upon returning the car we also took a video and then dropped the keys in the box (again no staff to take the car back or inspect it). A week later im then charged for fuel, baring in mind the car had more miles of fuel than when i collected it. Then weeks later im sent an invoice for damages which you can clearly see were there on the video when we collected the car. This video proof is not good enough, they want JPEG photos and are still proceeding to charge my card £280- even though I have proven we did not cause the damage. This is morally wrong, it is ridiculous to expect someone to find the car, inspect every inch of it, then go an que back up at the desk to try and get an employee to help with kids hanging off you!\nWill never use Europcar again\n\n*****Update*****\nhave emailed the customer service as advised in the response to my review.

Agent said they would send an email to confirm my call. Glasgow Europcar had my flight number and phone number. I stayed in a hotel that was a 3 minute walk to Europcar and when I arrived at 9.30am I was told they had given it away the their 1st customer of the day as they put me down as a no show. Agent was rude not apologetic and told me I would need to pay £400 extra for a premium car!! When I explained that I called their call center he told me to call them again as there was nothing they could do as they had already cancelled my booking without Informing me. I called the call center for them to say as I could not collect at 10pm the car was released and a refund given, I was not told this when I called from the airport waiting for my delayed 3 hour flight. Left me at Glasgow airport with no form of transportation for me to get to Inverness. Worst customer service I have experienced in a long\ntime!! If you can't get to your booked car due to no fault of your own and you have taken to steps protect your booking by calling the call center be prepared for your car to be cancelled and not to be informed until you go and collect.\nI will be putting in a formal complaint as I have not received my refund yet and I have had to find and extra £600 for a car from another company\nNo holiday treats for me or my family!!"

He offered full insurance, but I refused because I had insurance from the bank that issued my card. However, he insisted on buying Road Assistance Express. I agreed. It cost me 104,76 pounds( 9,17 per/day). Three hours later, on a very narrow road, we hit a rock with the left front wheel. The tire was punctured and flat. Of course, there was no spare wheel - a big hello to Mercedes-Benz with its B200! I called 0800 0280999, which was listed where I was looking for a spare wheel. It turned out this was impossible from my US phone! As it turned out later, the company's website listed a different number for non-UK phones - 0116 247 3228. However, this number was not listed in the agreement or anywhere in the car. This is simply outrageous! In the end, I got through. Explained the situation. It took almost a one hour(!) - endless waits on hold, interruptions, stupid offers to rate their work.... finally I was told that help was on its way. This was around 4:00 PM 17 September. NO ONE CAME OR EVEN CALLED before sunset at 7:20PM! I had to find a mobile tire repair shop and resolve the issues for 230 pounds. I am writing this the next day at noon. No one has called yet.

This was only recorded as pending on your account and not as a completed transaction. When the vehicle was returned, the full amount was reversed and was not converted into a transaction. The above amount would then be released back into your available balance. The number of days this would take is a banking process, not a Europcar one,and this takes around 3-10 working days to show on the account (up to 28 days for international transactions).\n\nIf your statement lists pending amounts separately, then the deposit amount should disappear from this list. Some online statements can show authorisations as debits, so again this should drop off and your available balance would increase. In either instance, you would not see a refund or credit in your list of transactions, as the deposit was not debited by us.\n\nI would like to offer my sincere apologies if this was not clearly advised previously and I thank you for bringing this to our attention.\n\nIf you require any further information regarding the deposit process, you can check our FAQ section on our website - >click here.\n\nI trust this information assists with your query.\n\n\nRegards,\n\nMaryam"

After waiting 1 week they replied saying that there was a mistake and they charged me \"1 additional day of hire plus licenses and fees due to an error\", so they refunded £15.82 for the overcharge. At that moment I was still confused why they haven't refunded the rest of the money, so I had to follow-up 2 times with them because they were not saying anything about the rest £52.38 pending to be refunded.\nThen finally they confirm that those 52 pounds are related to an upgraded added at the counter and that at the time of the pickup, there was added a \"Roadside Assistance Express.\"\n\nAt this moment I also realize that the agent basically did this intentionally because I didn't buy the full coverage insurance at the counter. I told the agent that I had my own private insurance and he stated that the private insurances from booking.com don't cover glass and wheels. I told him that it was an insurance with my bank and that it has full coverage, so it seems like in that moment he decided to add the Roadside Assistance Express and didn't me anything that this was an upgrade and that I had to pay £52.38 extra for it.\nIf he would have done that, obviously I would have say no because I have full private coverage insurance already for this.\n\nWhat did the agent do? He just told me to sign the Rental agreement in multiple corners of the paper on both sides and that's it. And then told me to put my credit card for the deposit. He also didn't mention the value of the total deposit and didn't say that he was charging me £700 for the non-insurance deposit and £52.38 for the Roadside Assistance Express. At that moment I would have also asked by there were 2 payments and I would have cancel it.\n\nThis is a very old school mislead sales tactic that should be claimed, but the customer service hasn't helped me further because I signed the agreement. The agent also signed the paper, but he didn't put his name, so I'm still waiting for a response from customer service to know the name of the agent who did this and file an official claim. What a terrible and disappointing experience."

      "text": "I recently had a europcar provided car rented for me by Audi as they had to keep my car in the workshop.\nThe fuel economy of the Mercedes CLA was great but when it was dropped off at my house on 29th August, it had been driven from their Heathrow depot, so they had used some fuel. As I was about to drive to Manchester and back, I went to Sainsbury's and filled it up. It took 6 litres. All in all - as tracked by Google Maps - I had driven 445 miles in the car by the time I dropped it at Guildford Audi on Friday 6th September (8Days).I filled the car again at Sainsbury's. I have the receipts. Europcar charged be for 466 miles and an excess fuel charge of £13.39 for 6 litres. This is exactly the same amount I had to put in on delivery.\nSo Europcar are charging me for their delivery costs not for my use. I will never ever hire a car from Europcar again. They are rip-off merchants"

Next morning I get a taxi and go there at 8.00am and they have no van and very little apology. I ask if another nearby branch might have a van and they say maybe, why don't you go and see. I ask if they could call ahead for me and they said no. I desperately needed the van as am clearing my deceased parent's house and this absolutely ruined all the complicated plans I had. And of course they still have my money which may take 30 days to refund!! Rude and unreliable, avoid avoid avoid."

This is fine if it's not raining, you are not miles from anywhere and if there is mobile coverage!! I had to walk 2 miles to get reception. I then had 4 hours to wait until a recovery vehicle arrived. The recovery firm had to wait until the next day to go to the nearest Kwickfit. We had to take a bus 2 hours to get to Oban to pick up the car the next day. The fault with the tyre was a leaky valve but because it had to be driven to clear the road it had to be replaced. Total bill from Europcar was £395!\nSo we lost a day with the car, fortunately, it was possible to extend our stay in our bnb for an extra day.\nAll this because Europcar removes an essential item to ask for an extortionate charge to insure against a puncture!"

      "text": "Be aware that not all collision damage protection policies are the same for all rental car companies! With Avis or Budget, CDW/LDW coverage means that the total cost of any damage to the car is waived — zero liability! But not with Europcar . . . their \"Medium Protection Plan\" just reduces liability to a maximum of £250, as I discovered when I returned a rental with a scuff to the alloy wheel. Yes that is in the fine print but it was not made clear when I picked up the car — in fact the agent encouraged me to take the additional tyre & glass protection to reduce liability — and when I returned the car the agent implied I would be covered. Subsequently, I got a letter from Europcar stating that I was financially liable for up to £250, after paying over £70 in protection coverage for a 2-day rental. Safe to say, I will avoid this company for any future rentals in favor of companies like Avis where waiver means waiver."

I booked the rental through a 3rd party comparison site and paid a deposit for the rental and was covered for some extras, such as environmental surcharge. On arrival at the rental centre we were in a queue for about an hour and when we got to the desk was greeted by a very pushy rep. The cost of the rental was not as per the original agreement and they had added on the additional environmental charge. The salesperson also tried to \"upsell\" me a Mercedes and additional insurance, which I declined, at which point his demeanor became more aggressive. I was also miss-sold a full tank of fuel on the understanding that I would only be charged for fuel I used. They also charged me over £400 for a tiny scratch on the bottom of the rear bumper which I must have missed on the initial inspection, however I do have insurance cover for this. Their business model is clearly to misrepresent the original displayed price and then aggressively sell or even miss-sell add-ons and I strongly suspect their staff are targeted and compensated based on these sales. I will never be renting from Europcar again and would urge others to think twice before using their services."

Essentially, when I returned the car, I parked it in the drop off bay, then headed in assuming we would do the check out report with the europcar person as it was within drop off hours, but the queue was HUGE, literally out the door into the street. I had work, so didn't get a chance to check out the car. They then sent me the email saying they found a small scratch to the alloy, that isn't covered, even though I got the highest insurance cover I was eligible for. I emailed to say that I didn't damage the car and if they had enough staff then we would have done the check out together, but they basically said that's not their problem and I will still be charged for the damage- despite escalating it.\n\n- I see their cutnpaste 'pretend to care' reply below.

Their employees cannot be trusted to list all existing defects and you may be found liable for them later.\nDo not believe the person handing you the keys when they say that there is only, for example, one item of minor damage on the rental agreement. I recently collected a car, was told that there was only one item of damage: a chip on the windscreen. When I checked over the car before leaving, I saw that there were scuff marks on the wheels but assumed that as it had not been mentioned this constituted usual wear & tear. The car hire rep was dealing with another customer. I am not a mechanic, nor an employee of a car hire company, to know what constitutes acceptable wear & tear or unacceptable damage. I accepted that he could do his job. A few days later I returned the car in the evening after the office had closed so did not see a car hire rep. 2 days later I was very surprised to receive an email stating that there were 5 items of 'new' damage. One of these was chipped paint on the edge of a door, something that would have been hard to see. The car hire rep had opened all the doors and taken detailed careful photographs. What a pity the same care had not been taken when the car was prepared for hire. I was lucky that my photographs showed all the ‘new’ items of damage to be pre-existing. The car hire company puts the onus on the customer to inspect the car (in detail). Their T&Cs state that “if you don’t notify us of pre-existing defect or damage to the vehicle then we will assume that you have accepted the vehicle in the condition set out in the rental agreement…” It is a shame that they cannot employ people who will professionally carry out their duties and ensure that cars are in a good condition and defects are accurately reported. The people in customer services are equally unhelpful; their attitude seems to be ‘tough, you agreed to the T&Cs’. The ineptitude of the people who check the cars and the ‘hard luck’ attitude of the customer services reflect the bad name that some car hire companies have."

I returned the key and was told “it was my job to move it” (by one of the four people standing around doing nothing)\n\n5) The car on filling up had a diesel cap but two stickers said unleaded petrol. I therefore was not able to fill as didn’t want to take the risk"

After being told I had to have it, later got charged for 2 different ones by Europcar that I didn’t agreed to. Stupidly didn’t read the terms on the contract I signed when I picked the car up at Europcar as I had the kids with me but also wasn’t looking out for it as I had already paid for everything up front. Wasn’t told to look at insurance details. Europcar then sent me an invoice that cost me an extra £144 at the end of the term and after disputing that with Europcar was told I had no case. I’d advise using another company, saying no to the add ons and checking everything on the contract."

I went into Derby branch complaining about a miss fire under light acceleration. Response, they all do that and its the only car we have issues with. Sorry cannot help. Try Nottingham, same response, it's only a 1 litre, what do you expect? What l expect is a rental car that does not misfire. Is that too much to expect? Plus we have no cars available dispute a jammed car park. Avoid the MG at all costs. 21-day rental and it will remain parked until l return to Gatwick. Gatwick good, MG BAD."

After I handed the car back at an attended check in, I was right there for about 20 minutes because I had to wait for a lift and everything seemed fine. 2 weeks later they sent a bogus damage charge out of the blue. Cue a 3 month long back and forth with them where I was consistently ignored, both the content of my emails and europcar would deliberately wait 2 weeks at a time to respond, presumably in the hopes I’d just give up and pay. They reached a final decision while still having not responded to me pointing out breaches in their terms and conditions so I took it to the ombudsman who reached a decision in my favour in only 2 days - in my opinion, proving that they are *able* to respond and had been choosing not to respond to me. I also had an issue that other people have had where someone verbally confirmed something but this information then just vanished into the ether when I tried to bring them up on it - fortunately this was a phone call so was recorded by the company. I will personally not use this company again and would suggest to anyone who does that you take every possible measure to protect yourself and just assume that the company will take advantage anywhere you leave them a chance to. I’d like to be able to add something positive but honestly even from the start it wasn’t a positive experience. There were more small incidents that didn’t warrant a complaint from me, such as a (male) check in attendant who didn’t understand why I (female) wouldn’t give out my personal details on the phone when I was in public on a train; the fact that I’d booked for a Vauxhall corsa type car and they gave me an MG SUV type vehicle when I’ve never driven anything that big before and the same man told me I’d probably find it easier because it’s automatic… in my opinion, just not a customer led experience or company attitude unfortunately"

I find out that Edinburgh Leith closes at 12 on a Saturday and is closed through Sunday. After phoning Europcar Leith, and then Europcar (main centre), I get to Edinburgh Airport who advise me that I should just hold onto the van and pay the extra 2 days worth of renting so I can return it on the Monday.\n\nI advise them that I am happy to drop it off at Edinburgh Airport as they are the ones who are forcing me to either pay extra for an extended rental agreement that was not originally agreed to when I paid. Edinburgh Airport say that they're happy to take the van and that I would not be charged anything for this.\n\nI receive the \"van is perfect, you'll get your full deposit back\" form back from Europcar, and then find a couple days later that they are holding onto my deposit and that I owe an additional £600 for a \"one-way surcharge\". This \"one-way surcharge\" was not in the price guarantee, and has not been communicated to me.\n\nI have been spending the past 3 weeks trying to resolve this, and have had 2 \"cases\" opened by Europcar to investigate this, but none have been closed or have given me any inkling into what actions will be done, despite being told I will hear back within 10 business days.\n\nThe company is an absolute scam, branches do not communicate to each other, and every representative is willing to blatantly lie so that they do not need to speak with you further.\n\nUPDATE: It took emailing every board member at Europcar to be escalated to the \"Executive Complaints\" teams, who supposedly looked at my case and acknowledged I was overcharged and removed the note on my credit report and all outstanding charges - and that was it. At the time, I was trying to apply for a mortgage and Europcar made this unbelievably stressful as I had a \"defaulted\" account on my credit report. Do not use. I cannot reiterate this enough."
