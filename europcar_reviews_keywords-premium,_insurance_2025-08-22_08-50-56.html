                <div class='text'>The booking.com website led me to Keddy by Europcar at Valencia airport in July with the promise of "no queues" but I had to wait more than 30 minutes to collect on arrival. I reserved a "T-Roc or similar" and tried to pre-empt me not getting "or similar" by contacting Europcar (Madrid) in advance. They responded with a "we cannot promise anything" and indeed when I arrived was given a Hyundai Tucson covered in scratches with a flogged engine 65k on the clock. Europcar then pre-authorised 800 Euros on my credit card in case of collision even though I had paid an extra 70 pounds to booking.com for full additional insurance (excess insurance). I hated the Hyundai Tucson. The safety features were infuriating with the parking brake auto-hold not having a light on the console and the locked patrol cap. The staff were very polite at Europcar Valencia airport but the experience was a let-down. One week after returning the car I noticed a further charge from Europcar on my credit card. When I contacted them they said it was an "environmental contribution" charged to me in error when it should have been charged to the intermediary (i.e. booking.com). Long story short I would avoid using either Europcar or booking.com for a car rental in the future.</div>

                <div class='text'>Daylight Robbery. Had to cancel my booking from Inverness Airport branch as my flight was cancelled . I foolishly hadn't checked every square millimetre of the website to find the 'refundable booking' button when I made the reservation so got charged the full value of the booking (£748.00) which included all the insurance waivers, extra driver even though clearly never used, surprised they didn't charge me for some fuel as well! In the end, we had to hire a car in Huntingdon and drive up to Scotland, and as Europcar had said they would refund me the full amount and didn't have a branch in Huntingdon, we used Enterprise - brilliant service, better car and cost £50 less anyway despite being a one-way hire with unlimited mileage. Will never use Europcar, ever.</div>

                <div class='text'>Scammers, extremely shady outfit.

I picked up my car in Johannesburg and they tried to give me a car without a damage report, telling me “it will be fine”.

Upon checking the car it had clearly been in some form of accident. It took an hour of refusing to take the car without damage report for them to finally say they would bring me a new car at my address later, but that I should take this one for now (I assume they then would have said the car was damaged by in the time between me taking it and them brining the new one).

Travelling with a newborn, this was stressful and they eventually brought me a new car with a damage report and assured me that I had the maximum insurance. Unfortunately this was not the case as I was hit by a driver running a red light and Europcar took £2000 from me.

Be careful, these guys are extremely shady.</div>

                <div class='text'>I am giving this Company a 1 star review, because I cannot give them any less.
I was given a hire 'car' by my insurance company while mine was being repaired. I am nearly 70 and need a car to get around, so when my car went in for some repairs, the repair company stated that their courtesy cars were too small for me, (I am quite tall) Europcar were my insurers choice to give me a suitable car. They contacted me top say that they had not got an SUV as requested, but would give me something as close to an SUV as possible. What they supplied was a 9seater mini bus.
I tried to contact them to explain that the 'car' was not suitable but every time I called, I was constantly put on hold. I even completed their contact us form only for them to send me a standard reply email 2 weeks after the van had been returned. Do not accept anything from this firm unless you are happy with the size of vehicle and the condition. make sure that you take an all round video just in case they try to con you for damage that you have not caused.</div>

                <div class='text'>CROOKS. Booked in advance but because they wouldnt accept different cards we had we were forced to take out their insurance for the week which was more than the cost of the car hire. We had arranged our own insurance at a tenth of the price but they would not even look at the paperwork. It was late with only a few other companies open and limited availability. When I asked why the insurance was so high they said it was a local insurance company. Never given a policy document just €268 item on the bill. We still had to pay a deposit. Read other reviews and see this is a common scam by them.</div>

                <div class='text'>I had a prepaid car rental voucher for a predetermined type vehicle through a third-party provider. I went to collect the vehicle from EuropCar Gatwick South Terminal to be told by the female EuroCar employee that the vehicle we ordered was not available. She said “We are giving you a free upgrade”. No mention of cost we would pay etc. because we were told they were GIVING us an upgrade. GIVING! It is my understanding that under law, if the company cannot provide the car ordered (and paid for) they must offer either a free upgrade or a lesser vehicle with a monetary refund, The upgrade was a very luxurious vehicle and I was immediately resistant and anxious and expressed deep concern to her, I was told by the female agent not to worry, the vehicle was at the end of its rental life, it had 50,000 miles on the odometer, which it did, and it was to be disposed of when I returned it. Reluctantly I accepted it. I felt it had been foisted upon me. When I was outside loading the car, the female agent came out and said the car had damaged wheels and I had to sign a form to acknowledge the damage. She presented form with a diagram of the car, both sides, with X marks on the wheels. I now realise she had folded the paper in half so that I couldn’t see what was on the other side. I really thought the shonky, trickster days of car hire had long gone. Boy was I wrong!!!
In hindsight I should have said NO! NO! NO and I should have run away, screaming, and rung the third-party provider and complained, but I didn’t, fool that I am. However, after 26 hours of travel I was exhausted, and yes, I now know I was dimwitted not to spot a scam in the making.
I hated the car from the start. This car wrecked my entire holiday and nearly wrecked me. I was highly anxious when I drove it and it made me quite ill from worry, It was too large and too wide for UK parking spaces. It literally got stuck in the entry to a shopping centre car park. It gave my daughter high level anxiety attacks. I had to try to park it away from other cars because I was terrified they would dent the car’s doors. This car was just too big,and too wide for UK narrow roads, even some A roads were scary and it did things I found hard to accept. It was so technical it was dangerous, simply because it was distracting.
But just as importantly, mechanically it was difficult. When the car started off there were many times when it just didn’t want to change up gears. Leaving Cobham Services, the car wouldn’t change gears at all and I held my breath thinking I would need a tow truck, but eventually it did change up. I am used to driving a Subaru with CVT automatic, but this vehicle had a habit of just stopping and not moving off. It would stop and go into Neutral and once you realised why the car wasn’t moving and what had happened, you had to go through the set process to get it going again. This happened in dangerous places at times like waiting to enter a large roundabout on a 70mph road. A friend suggested I return the car and I jolly well wish I had.
On the day I had to return the car to Gatwick, a yellow message about the tyres appeared on the consol. 8 calls to EuropCar proved useless and so I drove just down the road to the local dealership for the marque. Service personnel said it was ok to drive it back and gave me instructions as to what to do with the gadget in the trunk should tyre pressure deteriorate. And this is how I returned the car.
During the term of the car hire I did check my credit card several times to see if EuropCar had levied the £1500 block for security and I was surprised they had not. I returned the car on 1 August and flew home. The day after I arrived home, I checked my credit card and found that at between the 29 July and 9 August (8 days after I had returned the car) EuropCar had charged me $3,630.06 in my money for the upgrade they told me they were GIVING me because they were unable to supply the car I had ordered and prepaid for. It was then that I remembered the woman who asked me to sign the document acknowledging the damage to the car, and it was then that I realised she had folded the document in half and therefore I could not see what was on the other side-the upgrade charges etc.What a Fool I am
I have lodged a dispute but EuropCarUK is notorious for completely ignoring disputes. I am told that what this woman did could be a criminal offence called Fraudulent Misrepresentation. Some could ask whether she is highly skilled in the dark arts of duplicity and deception? Of course I will not be letting this matter go and others in the travel and insurance industries have been advised. Eventually when I can confidently tell the Citizens Advice Bureau,Trading Standards,Watchdog and Rip-off Britain that EuropCar has done absolutely nothing to resolve my dispute,then I will lodge a dispute with the BVRLA to whom EuropCar belong.</div>

                <div class='text'>I’m extremely disappointed with Europcar. When I picked up my car at Birmingham Airport, I clearly declined additional protection cover, as I had already purchased my own insurance.
Despite this, I was still charged £281.57 for an extra package I never agreed to. The agent made no effort to explain the charges, and I only realised later when the amount appeared on my invoice.
This feels like a deliberate upsell — especially knowing that staff may be incentivised to add extras. Europcar refused to refund me, so I’ve had to escalate to the BVRLA and my credit card provider.
Avoid unless you're prepared to challenge everything at the desk.</div>

                <div class='text'>Rented from Europcar Luton Airport and had a terrible experience.

1️⃣ Hidden & Duplicate Charges
My booking clearly stated that Airport Surcharge and Vehicle Licence Fee were prepaid. But after returning the car, I was charged again for: Licenses and Fees &
Premium Station Surcharge

Europcar claimed these were “not charged again,” just shown again. Yet, £214.41 was deducted from my credit card — part of which they admit was £180.18 for Roadside Assistance, which I never intended to buy. That leaves £34.23 unexplained.

2️⃣ Misleading Upselling
Despite already having full insurance, I was pressured to buy Roadside Assistance at pickup. The staff explicitly told me it would not cost extra and was “included in the basic insurance.” This is clearly false and designed to exploit tourists unfamiliar with UK rental terms.

3️⃣ Admin Fees Without Proof
Charged £45 per “admin fee” for supposed fines or tolls — yet no evidence or notice was ever provided.

❗ Avoid Europcar. It will give you nothing but a deeply unpleasant experience. Nothing else.</div>

                <div class='text'>Forced premium insurance

Rented a car for a week in Birmingham at EuroPcar

Had a full insurance over booking.com and when I arrived at the place to pick up the car, the staff just told me that their system can't accept the insurance that I bought over booking.com

The staff then forced me to buy one of their premium insurances before they would give me the keys to the car while then getting in contact with a person. They knew who to call at booking.com to force the cancelation of my insurance from there. My original price when I booked the car was around 60 pounds which then was changed to 250 + 100 in deposit.

The choice I had were 250 gbp + 100 gbp in deposit for full insurance
150 gbp + 200 gbp in deposit for half insurance
and the most outrages one was 87 gbp + 700 gbp in deposit for only windshield insurance

Had to talk with the support 3 times and on the second time I called in toto hear about the deposit. The lady on the phone just said I should wait and placed me on a waiting line just to end the call.
I tried it once more after half an hour and spoke with someone who tried to help me.

And just for the icing on top , I get a a late notification about a parking ticket when I dropped of my partner.
It was sent extremely late.</div>

                <div class='text'>I booked a car online with everything confirmed and paid in advance. At the counter, I clearly declined extra services and only requested prepaid fuel.

Despite that, I was later charged for an additional insurance I never agreed to, followed by another unexpected charge after returning the car — with no explanation or invoice. On top of this, my deposit was never refunded!!!

I contacted customer service multiple times via email. To this day, no one has responded.

Extremely poor experience, lack of transparency, and zero customer support. I cannot recommend this company.</div>

                <div class='text'>The longest wait I have ever had for a hire car - it was inconceivable the amount of time they took to deal with people. Then there was a problem with my booking and we had to start again. They refused to allow me to use my own insurance. They were uncontactable after the hire to discuss a lost jacket. An absolute shower . . . And very expensive. They also misled me about there being no petrol stations nearby in order to encourage me to take their fuel pre- paying service.</div>

Arrived with the driver saying “ you won’t like it” , well that was a good start.
The car was fine, arrived with a full tank of petrol etc.
had it for 10 days, I called to say we had our own car back following repairs and I was told the courtesy car would be picked up the following day at a certain time.
No sign of them.
No answer to my calls.

They emailed me on the morning of my last day stating that the vehicle insurance was no longer valid and that the vehicle was overdue although I had paid. They then took out 2 identical payments of 83.34 from different branches and a further payment of 178 after I had complained and they had ensured that my case was being looked in to. Now they are taking forever to respond and not looking in to my case with urgency although they have taken roughly £500 for no reason</div>

When you select the MG model online, when you come to pick it up you will likely be told it’s not available but they can upgrade you to a premium model. They will offer you standard model car that even by their own website can only take 2 cases. Forcing you into the premium models.

By this point you are stuck. An online booking of £850 cost me £2,000 in increased insurance coverage (yeeeah they waived the upgrade fee). They are only interested in upselling anything they can to you.</div>

                <div class='text'>‼️ warning ‼️ warning ‼️ do not rent any vehicles from this company.

I rented a car for 4 days I took full cover out which covered the Tyers and the whole of the car.

So I headed to the highlands with my wife and unfortunately I got a flat tire.

I called customer service to arrange for a recovery van to come out to give me a new tyre but I was told sorry we don't come to the highlands you will have to arrange your own replacement.

I said too the person on the other end of the phone but I have full cover 24 hour cover is that not correct
I was told you do have that cover

So I said what's the problem

I was then told again we don't come up to the highlands

I said then you should not of sold me the policy as I told the girl at the Edinburgh airport
Office that's were I am going as she asked me were I was travelling too
her name is Kim

I had no choice but too call my own recovery van it cost 171 pounds

Europcar sells insurance policy that are false. They are full of lies do not believe them
I was a member but have had enough of there lies and how they treat there costumers</div>

                <div class='text'>I was the victim of a very well practiced con trick by the desk staff at Faro airport. After I booked the car in the UK, I phoned Europcar and asked if they sold damage waiver Insurance (I normally buy it separately online). I was told that it wasn't necessary as all their cars were fully covered under the rental agreement. At the Faro desk, I agreed to pay for a vehicle upgrade, and they asked me for a large amount of deposit to cover damage. Realising that I did need damage waiver, I told them I was just going buy the damage waiver online for £42 for the 8 days i needed. The desk staff said they would sell it to me for £24, so I accepted. When my credit card bill came through, they had charged me £24 a day! They also charged me around an extra £50 to collect the car! I have phoned and written to complain, but they don't care. Of course they don't - it's their way of operating - deceitfuly. I'm really dissapointed, I thought they were a reputable company 😔</div>

                <div class='text'>We arranged to pick up a hire car at Alghero Airport in Sardinia for a five day hire period. All was going well and a set of keys were set out for us. This was UNTIL the rep realised we had purchased fully comprehensive insurance and that both husband and wife would be driving. The key was swiftly removed from us and we were handed keys to a Dacia Sandero. All I can say is that this car looked like it had been owned by a succession of learner drivers. There were scratches and dents everywhere and the car wasnt particularly clean inside. The tyres were barely legal and in a bad state for the dusty roads. Total deception on our side as we paid over £500 for this experience (and were parked next to the shiny new Peugeot we were meant to be picking up). Will not ever use this company again and will be watching the credit card carefully now following other reviews.</div>

                <div class='text'>I was told it's now IMPOSSIBLE to book a small car from Glasgow, unless you pay extra. I'm a Europcar regular - I'm looking at my online record and I see ten rentals in the last two and a bit years. These are private retals, spanning Portgal, France, Germany, Spain and the UK.
I booked a Compact car ('Cupra Leon or similar' - that's a small hatchback. As on my last trip to Scotland, I was instead given a dreadful, wallowy, absolutely huge MG SUV. I asked for a smaller car at the desk, and was told I could have a BMW 1 series - for an extra £30 a day. I was told it's not possible to get the car I asked for without going premium - instead I had to put up with a bloated, rubbishy Chinese SUV.
To make things worse, the car stank of cigarettes - some previous user had been smoking in it. I complained before I drove away, and it was recorded (so I wouldn't have to pay for the damage - probably impossible to clean effectively) but I wasn't offered a change of vehicle.
Still, at least there wasn't a queue. On two receent trips - to Toulouse in France in June, and to Portugal in April - I had to queue for more than an hour to collect the keys. There's no 'Privilege' desk any more for regular customers - no reward for customer loyalty, for filling out details in advance to speed things up. No, you queue with all the people who need every last comma on the contract explained to them, while staff try their hardest to up-sell. EVERY. STUPID. TIME.
Anyway I'm getting utterly fed up with Europcar, I noted that queues at some other rental places are much shorter. I don't know if Hertz or Avis have a functioning loyalty programme but I might give them a try.
I moved to the Europcar app after using brokers for years, after two unforunate experiences (with Greenmotion in Edinburgh, and Goldcar in Italy - the latter now ironically a Europcar brand) where I was ripped off for non-existent damage I didn't do. I have a global excess policy that I use everywhere from the US to Taiwan and Japan, as well as across Europe. But these two were the only times it's been triggered. To be fair, Europcar haven't ripped me off in this way. It's a credible brand. But customer service has not recovered from COVID and it seems it may well be time to move on.</div>

                <div class='text'>I have only given them 1 star because I cannot give nil. The most useless bunch of incompetents in the world. Do not use them! Was given a hire car by them whilst mine was in for repair. Told to call them to arrange collection when finished with to arrange collection. Can only call central number who could not organise collection every time they tried to put me through to the local depot I was sent back in a circle to the incompetents on the central line. Eventually after an hour calling these buffoons I gave up and called my insurance company direct. Do not use these if you value your sanity. A central number is no good if they can’t do anything and transfer you to someone who can! Br told they will put it in your notes repeatedly is no use- I just want it downhired and collected!</div>

                <div class='text'>Car was perfect, pick up and drop off great. However not one for extra insurance normally I was encouraged to take the £28.70 to protect my excess.
OMFG! It was PER DAY 😭 Then don’t forget the hidden charge for picking up from an airport?!
On what planet does it cost an extra £208 to hire a car dwarfing the original cost.
Disgusting pricing strategy that will exclude Europcar from any further business of mine. Joke of a business!</div>

                <div class='text'>My flight was diverted to Toulouse, my booked hire car was in Carcassonne Obviously stressed, as any passenger would be in the circumstance, I arranged an alternative at Toulouse. The office there oversold and, because I was so stressed, I wasn't thinking at the time and I signed the contracted. Later, I realised that the excess insurance which I had been told was included was an added extra (cover I didn't need) and I also realised that I should have been offered a one-way hire for one day, rather than being given a cancellation of my week's hire at Carcassonne and a new hire one-way hire from Toulouse for the week at a cost of some €600 more.

No apology from Eurocar. Just a "tough luck, you signed". They'll not get that chance again from me, even if they're the cheapest option.</div>

                <div class='text'>I rented a car from Europcar Gatwick in February 2025. When making the booking I added full insurance through the booking agent Discover cars and the supplier being keddy (AKA Europcar).
At the desk the lady verbally said she could see I had insurance so all was good, I paid the deposit.
It wasn’t until I looked at the invoice at home and saw a charge for premium insurance which had been added on top of the full cover insurance I had already purchased online. The premium insurance added was for £274. I immediately phoned Europcar, they told me they couldn’t do anything til after the car had been returned. So I emailed them once I had returned the car and keys to the out of office box.
This was in February. I have formally complained 3? times now. And nothing. I left a review on Google and Europcar just sent me the link to complain, the same link I’ve used several times already with no response.
I’ve seen lots of other Google reviews where people have been in the same situation as me. They just seem like an absolute scam of a company. And then actually ignore you when you try and pull them up on it. AVOID EUROPCAR.</div>

                <div class='text'>Placed a premium booking on Tuesday to collect on Friday. When I arrived to pick up I was told there was a new policy implemented 12 hours ago and they cannot release the car to me unless I have a airplane ticket booked. This was not communicated at any point and now left without a car! Extremely dissatisfied would never recommend anyone hiring from this company.

They offered to book a regular car however said they would need to charge me the premium charge cost I already paid so nearly £400 for a car they hire normally for £30?? Complete madness.</div>

                <div class='text'>Very disappointed with the service from the Maidstone branch. A hire car was due to be delivered to my 76-year-old mother at 9:00 AM. At 9:20, we received a call saying it would be delayed by an hour. When we asked for clarity or if the time could be improved, we were met with hostility and completely unhelpful customer service.

We were given contradictory excuses—first that they couldn’t reach the driver, then that the driver hadn’t even arrived at the office (despite the drive itself taking an hour). None of it made sense, and it was clear the car was never going to arrive on time.

The most frustrating part was the lack of honesty and the rude attitude. Eventually, the car was cancelled without informing us—we only found out through our insurance.

Extremely poor communication, no accountability, and unnecessarily stressful—especially for an elderly customer. We would never choose to use this company again given the choice.</div>

                <div class='text'>We rented a car for our holiday in lake Garda .
And what a an unsafe shit show it was .
Firstly they tried to charge us more for our insurance cover and more for the child seat that we had all ready paid for.
Then the Q5 that we had originally thought we was getting was a beat up old Citroen which didn’t barely have room for our 2 suit cases and the boot flung open on the motorway where the bags were crammed in and they had the cheek to try and charge us more insurance on this car and more for the child seat !
Then when we got the car this is the whopper the child seat that we had booked and paid for for our 2 and half year old they brought out a car seat for a rear facing new born baby. When we alerted the staff they brought out a booster seat for a 4 year old plus and before we could raise concerns the man literally ran off and we had to leave the car park due to other cars trying to leave and blocking up the car park.Them they said you agreed to pay the extra insurance which was flung on us at a busy desk with a queue of people in a foreign country!
So for our holiday for 8 days we had to drive with our daughter in a seat belt which is completely illegal and unsafe and restate the work unsafe !
Due to this we didn’t drive 80 % of the holiday which we had planned to .
And still when I rang up customer service about all this when home they just brushed off the safety of our child as we have no evidence of the car seat and there is nothing we could do…. Surely they had the 2 car seats in there depot so surely that would be evidence enough.
The fact that we paid money to Europacar pre booked our child seat and car and they didn’t have the safety equipment of the car seat to keep our child safe is outrageous.
And then to be told we can not do anything about this is a sneaky and unsafe way to do business.
I would like to see if I rented a car and child seat for one of their children and rush them out of the car park and see how they would feel.
I would never use Europacar ever again unsafe unprofessional and sneaky aswell in the end .
Take your money and provide an unsafe service disgusting.</div>

                <div class='text'>This was my first time hiring a car, and I am so frustrated with my experience with them. They gave me a car that had a screw in the tyre. Without going into all the details here, they basically accused me of lying. I wrote many emails of complaint but they still charged me £195 for a tyre. I had taken insurance with a different company because it was cheaper but honestly I have never known any company to have such little regard towards their customers. From start to finish with company, I would go as far to say that they are the worst company of any company I have ever experienced.
The dashboard said there was a low tyre as I was leaving the depot, so I had a quick look and judged that none looked low to the eye, and just thought I’d keep an eye on it and pump it up myself to get it to the correct level. According to them, I should have checked all the tyres for screws and nails before leaving. Are you serious? I drove home and left it on the drive over night. In the morning it was nearly completely flat. I drove to a petrol station to pump it up noticed a screw in the tyre. I called them and was told to take it back to the depot. I did this, and I was told to take to Kwik Fit. I was also told it would be free as it wasn’t my fault. The apparently have no recollection of this. Their customer service have been terribly rude, and condescending, and any emails I have sent have not been personable in any way. No apology for my bad experience due to their incompetencies.</div>

                <div class='text'>I wish to provide a candid warning to those contemplating the prospect of hiring from this company, particularly with regard to their Heathrow branch. This caution is underscored by a significant volume of negative reviews available online, and my experience is not isolated.

During my interaction with the Heathrow location, I was subjected to charges exceeding £200, categorised as a Premium Station surcharge. This fee is levied despite the availability of other provincial alternatives within a reasonable taxi or cab fare of approximately £20. Furthermore, I was charged for Super Premium Personal Accident Cover, which is redundant as I possess my own comprehensive annual coverage with premiums totalling less than the cost of their two-week charge. Additionally, their breakdown cover was almost twice the cost of a standard RAC or AA annual policy for annual duration.

Regrettably, I discovered these exorbitant charges only upon receipt of my invoice, as none of these fees were disclosed to me in advance. I strongly advise prospective customers to explore numerous online options for car hire excess cover provided by various insurers, which are available at a fraction of the costs imposed by this company. It is prudent to exercise caution; these charges are often hidden until after the transaction.

My attempts to rectify the situation were met with a lack of accountability. I engaged with a representative named Monica at a Spanish call centre, who assured me that the matter would be investigated. However, after a five-day interval, I was informed that no action had been taken, and I was told that Monica would face internal disciplinary measures.

Although a decision was made to refund my charges, I was subsequently informed that the process would take five days due to the sum exceeding their operational limits, necessitating approval from the UK. This was further compounded by a call handler abruptly ending our conversation when I sought clarification, stating that they were restricted in the length of calls. Once approval was secured, I was told that an additional ten days would be required for the funds to reach my account.

This level of indifference displayed by their representatives is striking, particularly in light of how they would likely respond if the roles were reversed and they were in a similar predicament. My experience has been distressing, exacerbating my PTSD with multiple triggers stemming from their deceptive practices.

I encourage anyone who has previously rented from this company to reassess their charges. Even years later, with the appropriate documentation, claims may be pursued in the County Court. To summarise:

1. Avoid utilising the Heathrow location.
2. Scrutinise all charges, regardless of the duration of your rental.
3. Research supplementary services available from various providers online.
4. Review competitor options thoroughly, paying particular attention to customer feedback.

Protect yourself and make informed decisions.</div>

                <div class='text'>We rented a car from Europcar Manchester via Expedia. As older French customers with limited English, we signed the rental agreement believing we were simply confirming the vehicle pick-up.

However, Europcar added extra paid services (premium insurance and roadside assistance) without clearly explaining them, even though we had already purchased full insurance coverage via Expedia.

Despite our complaints, Europcar refused any refund, relying solely on our signature and ignoring the language barrier and the context in which it was signed.

This was a very disappointing experience and, in our view, a clear abuse of vulnerability. We strongly advise non-English speakers or older travellers to avoid Europcar unless all documents are clearly translated and explained.</div>

I told them I didn't need any insurance cover as I'd already purchased this. They assured me that I would not be charged for insurance or other charges and this was just a formality. I signed their document only after being reassured by their staff member that my credit card would not be debited. On returning the car, by credit card was debited nearly 500 GBP for 'Premium Protection' cover. They refuse to refund or investigate the actions of their staff member.</div>

                <div class='text'>Every single time I have dealt with Europcar I have had nothing but problems!!!
I tried to book a vehicle as per my insurance company had advised.
It took 8 phones call over 2 days and 3 agents to finally get it booked.
I received an erroneous email confirming my booking for the wrong date and found that I’d been lied to by agents about the booking being made.
Then the car wasn’t delivered on time (over an hour late) after I called to find out where it was and was told.
The booking hasn’t been put on the computer.
Car was great in fairness, a few bits of damage (which I have photos and videos of) but ran like a dream.
Today I took the car to the garage as agreed and tried to advise Europcar I had left the vehicle as agreed.
6 phone calls, 2 agents and countless lies later (and being talked over) I’ve been advised that the car will be collected tomorrow.
I’m very sceptical and wouldn’t be surprised if it’s isn’t collected. I was promised written confirmation to protect myself and haven’t received it.
We’ll see if it is collected or not and if it isn’t I swear I’m going to go absolutely nuts!!!
I would rate 0 if I could and would highly recommend not using Europcar.
Interestingly I’m clearly not on my own.</div>

                <div class='text'>We hired a car from Bristol Airport. We have been charged an extra £86.28 at the end of the hire & no idea what for. Emailed the company to be told it was a verbal agreement with the staff member who dealt with us. There was no verbal agreement & no other service was sold to me. I was asked if I had the correct insurance which I had as I had purchased the premium insurance & the guy behind the desk was not happy I was not spending more money.
He then said that £186 had to be held on my credit card & it would be refunded. This was a lie & he has kept £86.28!!
I have emailed advising this is fraud & theft! Waiting on a response.
Do not use Europcar the are fraudulently taking money from people!!! Dreadful customer service</div>

                <div class='text'>Reading the reviews on here I realise I have experienced ALL of the same problems as other customers over a period of time whilst using Europcar on a regular basis.

I was accussed of tyre damage 6days after returning a vehicle, I challenged them asking for eveidence, the case was closed and I never received any eveidence.

I was then unknowingly charged for the additional Insurance, actially adding a further £884 to my hire, I challenged them again requesting for the CCTV from when I collected the car as I wished it to be viewed in the hope a lip reader could translate my conversation with the member of staff that dealt with the hire. The case was found in my favour & the case was closed.

A car I had on hire was parked outside my house, unfortunately another drived crashed into the hired car 🙄 I was assured by Europcar that the car would be collected & a replacement would be delivered, 2 days later still no replacement car, so I hired from another company as needed a vehicle for work purposes, Europcar had already lost me 2 days income 🙄
Several days later Europcar took a further payment from my account! Which then raised my hire by ££££'s! I have emailed & called then raising concern and asking for an explanation, to date I have received a email response advising "Once they obtain the relevant information they will be intouch" I sent them screen shots of everything with my initial email 🙃 The email they email me from you can't reply to 🤔
Several weeks later I have called them 3 times, each time being told they will contact a diffrent department as they can't help 🤪
My latest email May 30th asking Europcar for an update has received no reply 🥴

Oh yes! I was also accused of damaging a panel on one of their hired cars to! Luckily for me I took a video of all the vehicle inside & out before I left the hire depot, the case was closed. There is never any previous damage maked on the paperwork they give you on hiring a car, Please be wise and take a video 👍

Do I have to take them to the small claims court? 🙂

I swear NEVER Again!

                <div class='text'>From start to finish dreadful. Courtesy/hire car was arranged through AA insurance following our car being involved in an accident.
Europcar sent me a supposedly secure link so that my payment card for the £1 deposit was logged. About 4 hours later I received a telephone call from a private number with the caller saying he was from Fraud Prevention. I was asked if I had used my card within the last half hour, which I hadn't and was then asked if I had made a payment of £1 to Europcar earlier. I was told that a payment of £2000+ had been made using my card and that it would seem it had been cloned. My money would be refunded and a new card issued but I needed to give more digits from my card. I realised this was a scam so hung up and contacted my bank. They were very concerned about the caller knowing about Europcar and asked me to contact Europcar which I did. I was assured that this matter would be investigated by their Fraud Department and that I would be kept informed - I haven't.
As far as the courtesy car is concerned it was delivered and collected a day late with little communication.

                <div class='text'>Abysmal customer service experience.
Misled in to purchasing additional insurance that I didn't need - ended up costing more than the cost of the car hire. I noticed this an hour after taking the car out and got in contact to cancel to which they said to wait until the end of my hire. I waited until the end of my hire and now they are refusing cancellation of policy.
Additionally had car issues which I tried to sort over the phone. Continuously passed around department with no ownership being taken. Europcar employee told me to drive car (which wasn't working correctly or safely) to nearest branch (over a 2 hour round trip) or they couldn't help.</div>

                <div class='text'>Please take heed — I would strongly advise avoiding this car hire company. We booked our rental through Auto Europe, unaware at the time that they act as a broker and that the actual rental would be fulfilled by Europcar. Had we known this in advance and read the reviews, we would never have gone ahead with the booking.

Upon arriving at Verona Airport, we eventually located the Europcar desk, and that’s when everything began to go wrong. The staff member at the desk was very insistent that we purchase additional insurance, despite the fact that we had already bought full protection through Auto Europe. Even after I phoned Auto Europe and they confirmed we were fully covered, the staff member continued to push the insurance, making us feel pressured and uncomfortable.

When we were finally given the keys, we discovered that the car provided was completely different from what we had booked. We had reserved a VW Tiguan or similar SUV specifically to fit our passengers and luggage, but were given a saloon instead. I returned to the desk, where I was told that SUVs and saloons fall into the same category. I contacted Auto Europe again, and after speaking with the Europcar desk staff, they informed me that nothing could be done as Europcar uses a different classification system than Auto Europe.

Eventually, a more suitable car was located, but we were told we’d have to wait 30 minutes while it was cleaned. In reality, we waited far longer — not an ideal start to a long-awaited holiday.

The car we were eventually given wasn't in the greatest condition, but at least it could accommodate both our group and our luggage and done the job. Still, the overall experience was disorganised, frustrating, and disappointing.

We left feeling exhausted before our trip had even begun. Based on our experience, I cannot recommend Europcar or Auto Europe and would urge others to think twice before booking.</div>

                <div class='text'>I would never have hired a car through Europcars had I read the bad reviews and unfortunately have to echo previous reviewers experiences. Didn’t chose them specifically but Ryanair must hold a contract with them as it automatically booked the car with them. Picked up lovely shiny car from Knock airport - did a cursory look around the car - MAKE SURE YOU VIDEO EVERY PART INSIDE AND OUT OF CAR which we didn’t and surprise surprise on returning the car the staff rushed out with a little measuring device and said we had scratched the car on the bumper and it was going to cost almost 1000 euros to fix!!! Firstly the car was driven very carefully, parked in wide disabled places and kept in locked area and never left unattended. I believe the scratches were probably there before. Not checked and they must have thought we will charge us for them. 1000 euros for scratches that could even be rubbed out!!! They even invoiced us within the hour. Even though I have separate insurance I am challenging this as a matter of principle. DO NOT HIRE A CAR A CAR FROM THIS COMPANY</div>

                <div class='text'>My daughter and son hired me a car from this company through Expedia. They paid extra for Expedia premium insurance. Expidia stated i need pay a £250 deposit. When I turned up at Gatwick airport from Latvia the representive said I had to pay £500 deposit which i never had. After a stressful wait my family transferred the extra money to my account. Europcar representive asked me to sign rental agreement which I did and they issued me a car. The car was returned 10 days later and I flew home. My £500 deposit was returned the following day. Then i had 2 payments taken from my account for £380, I found out that the representive had added premium insurance without my knowledge and after many emails to there customer service department they refused to refund the charge. I am a pensioner on a small income this has created me with financial problems. BE CAREFUL OF THIS COMPANY WATCH WHAT YOUR SIGNING FOR.</div>

                <div class='text'>When I wanted to extend the hire period, I called them and was told the van had actually been returned the day before, which is not true. I started calling them around 10:30 and kept trying until the afternoon, but still no answer. I was even on hold for hours, and no one was able to help. They kept pushing me from one person to another. It’s now 15:10 in the afternoon, and I still haven’t gotten an answer.

I wonder if the van shows as returned because I have the return statement and the invoice, for which I paid in full. However, the driver was charged for insurance again at the branch on the collection day.

What if I keep the van since no one has been able to fix this inconvenience? I would not recommend this service at all. Their communication skills are poor, and when I finally managed to get someone on the line, she hung up on me just because I was asked for stupid details that were not relevant at all, considering the van hire period was completely closed.

The car was damaged, dented and scratched from previous hiring that we highlighted to them when we picked it up. I'm sure all this damage had been previously claimed and paid but never repaired.

                <div class='text'>Awful experience. I was in the UK to move my mum into care following her strokes and I hired a car from Eurocar. I returned it, with no damage to the car, gas tank full, and got a return receipt as proof of that. I had already paid for the hire and full insurance prior to arrival, so when I queried the additional large charge to my credit card when I arrived back home 2 week later, I discovered they had in fact charged me twice for the one car hire. It has been extremely stressful given why I was in the UK in the first place, but then to have this extra charge on my card, it has caused me no-end of stress. I made a complaint, raised a claim and have heard NOTHING from them. They owe me almost £400 and I have not had any response from their claims team. PLEASE DON'T USE THEM. Unfortunately I am now involving a solicitor which they will end up paying for. Such a simple solution could have been given, with all my paperwork and proof of overcharges, they just needed to refund me. I hate giving bad reviews, but this time it is 100% warranted.</div>

                <div class='text'>I rented a van from Europcar, and the experience was nothing short of disgraceful. The attendant at the reception was not just rude — she was downright hostile. She repeatedly pressured me to accept unnecessary add-ons and even went so far as to suggest I’d likely end up in an accident for declining the additional insurance excess reduction. That kind of fearmongering is completely unacceptable. She asked the same intrusive questions multiple times — “How far are you going?” “When exactly are you bringing it back?” — in a tone that made me feel like I was begging to borrow her personal vehicle rather than paying to rent from a major company. The whole exchange was uncomfortable, condescending, and frankly, humiliating. At one point, I was so taken aback by her attitude, I genuinely considered walking away and telling her to keep the van. Renting a vehicle shouldn’t feel like being interrogated or talked down to. If this is how Europcar treats paying, polite customers — then count me out for good. I wouldn’t recommend this branch to anyone. Absolutely dreadful service.</div>

                <div class='text'>This was the worst car rental experience I’ve ever had.

From the beginning, we were treated with arrogance and disrespect. I had booked a decent car, and they handed me a wreck – filthy, falling apart, and barely drivable. It looked like it belonged in a junkyard. An absolute disgrace.

I had purchased full insurance coverage, so I wasn’t supposed to be charged for anything. Still, they held a deposit of £125, which was initially released, and then they took the money from my account after I had already left, with no explanation. That’s not a mistake – that’s outright theft.

This is not just poor service – it’s dishonest and unethical. Europcar in Tunis is running a scam. What they’re doing is not car rental, it’s abuse and legalized robbery.

Avoid this company at all costs. I wouldn’t wish this experience on anyone.</div>

                <div class='text'>Professional scammers. Stay away. One of the worst experiences we had with a car rental company. We ended up paying €1000 for a basic 208 Peugeot which on their website was €300 when we initially paid for it. They also scammed us with €200 for a 3cm scuff on the wheel which was there before we rented the car, I showed the picture to them and the representative said I shouldn’t worry because it’s covered by the insurance (this was of course a lie) but they just need to record it for the next rental. They then also billed €87 for the damage admin fee. Be prepared to never see your deposit back and once you return the car if you don’t have a credit card then make sure you move the money from your account as they will just start charging random amounts to your debit card. Make sure you email all photos and videos and detailed description 1hr after you get the car as otherwise they won’t care what photos or videos you have. They lie, scam and steal and add secret charges that you didn’t ask for. We didn’t ask for roadside assistance and somehow it showed up on the invoice. There’s also a massive airport fee which they don’t tell you about in advance. Every price they say is without VAT, which they forget to mentioned. Do yourself a favour and find a local/family owned company outside of the airport and never go near Europcar as you will be robbed. Hopefully someone will eventually win a legal case against them.</div>

                <div class='text'>After an accident my AA Insurance organised a loan vehicle, the vehicle was dropped off at my home address keys left with a relative.
On my return I inspected the vehicle and proceeded to do a short run to the local store but found the tyre warning light on, I thought maybe the tyre needed pumping up , after a 8 minute journey the tyre went completely flat resulting in calling out the AA and being escorted to quick fit for a new tyre, the AA engineer found a tyre valve wedged in the wall of the tyre.
Eurocar want me to pay £159 for a new tyre which is an absolute disgrace.
They should have let me inspect the vehicle before leaving the keys with someone els , as now I can’t prove the vehicle was ok at time of drop off.
SO I SAY DONT EXCEPT A VEHICLE WITH EUROCAR UNLESS YOU INSPECT IT INSIDE AND OUT .</div>

                <div class='text'>We booked a car via sunny cars for eur 350. When we came back home I received an extra amount to pay of eur 500 for upgrade car, surcharge airport and insurance. This is what happenend.

We were in a hurry , because we had a delay with the airplane and had a meeting. The woman who helped us , Sharon, was very nice and said to help us as quickly as possible and that everything was taken care of. She said that she would provide us with a nice car. She saw that we already had full coverage via Sunny cars so also no need to check the car.
“ We have to block a certain amount on your credit card but that is for deposit purposes only” she said “ You just have to sign here , here and here and then you can go “

So that is what happened . When we were back in the Netherlands I received your mail about the credit card payment. AN EXTRA eur 500 ( apart from the gasoline which is OK )

This is part of their business model . BE CAREFULL with EUROPCAR UK</div>

                <div class='text'>Absolute scammers. A car crashed into my rental while I was 15 miles away. The company have ignored my requests for any information on the insurance claim, only able to send invoices and debt collectors. It's been seven months since the driver knocked my door and admitted fault. They've given me no communication on the insurance and now im at a dead end where every department has told me they dont deal with this but also refuse to give me another department to try. I have even explained im happy to pay the money I just want to see some documentation on the insurance outcome as over one month after they confimed they hadn't started this process yet. I just want to know how to get reimbursement when the insurance claim goes through. Don't use this company if you like your sanity.... Absolute disgraceful service</div>

                <div class='text'>Would have given 0 stars if option

Seems to be a theme about mis selling insurance. I am currently "in conversation" with customer services about added extras I never ordered and I am looking for a refund. I never requested roadside assistance or personal protection but these were added to invoice. This is a scam where they make these additions part of your deposit. It is basically theft.

Customer services have now told me that cannot do anything as they were not part of verbal conservation at location - they have said that I should have been offered extras and asked to accept or decline which never happened.

So basically buyer should be aware of this practice and scrutinise what you are signing up for and make sure no extras have been added surreptitiously

I would also beware of premium location surcharge that is added to costs.
I certainly will not hire from them again.</div>

                <div class='text'>Edit 26 May: It is impossible to get hold of anyone on the phone or via email. It all looks professional but there is ZERO customer service. Do not go near this company.

For a 6 day hire my bill so far is gbp 400 plus deposit. I feel totally ripped off. I have not been able to drive the car because a tyre had 2 holes in it and no one was interested in resolving the problem. I have been stuck in one place waiting for repairs to be done. There was no spare tyre.
I went through Rentalcar.com which is a broker. I was in a difficult situation and had to hire in a hurry for a next day, Saturday, start. I requested a Leeds city pick up and Manchester airport drop off on Thursday. I was charged 233gbp, then 85gbp extra when I went to pick up the car because the ‘different drop off location’ had ‘dropped off’. Plus a deposit which was ok and expected, if large. There was another extra charge for road usage when I picked up the vehicle. Prices are advertised in GBP but my UK credit card was charged in NZ dollars - I’m using an NZ mobile phone and drivers license but there was no obvious option to change the currency quoted/charged in. So then the insurance cover was added - the wording strongly suggests you need their full insurance offer. This was £65 for 6 days. Charging my UK credit card in NZ$ incurred four times unnecessary conversion fees. By now I’m committed and don’t have time (or energy because I’m dealing with a family emergency and really need a good reliable car, right now) to find another supplier so accepted the deal.
I booked a 10am pick up. There was a 15’ wait before being able to begin completing the paperwork and pick up the car. The car itself is ungroomed in the interior, and didn’t drive well from the get go. Shortly after leaving the pick up point an alarm appeared saying ‘tyre pressure low’. I did not have time to deal with this immediately. When I called Europcar (the end supplier) two days later, by which time the wheel alignment feels obviously wrong, I waited a very long time for an answer and was eventually shunted through to someone who turned out to be the AA who came out to check the car through their breakdown service. Whilst the AA is always great, I could have called them on my own membership and saved the 30 minutes + waiting for Europcar to answer. So at this point I had no usable car (for which I’ve paid a very expensive total hire rate) and was stuck waiting for a roadside rescue service to help me out with ‘my’ problem. The AA turned up as promised an hour later, removed a nail ‘which has been in there a long time’, did a temporary fix so I could get to some local appointments early the next day (having by now not been able to get to that day’s necessary hospital visit and run other urgent medical-related errands), and booked a new tyre service Kwikfit who replaced the tyre the next day. They found another nail in the tyre and let slip that poor quality tyres on loaned-out vehicles are a common problem with Europcar vehicles. The worst part of this is that Europcar do not answer the phone and even when they do couldn’t give a damn. When I did eventually get through to a customer service agent she was smugly rude by just meeting my concerns with deliberate silence. She finally put me through to ‘the local branch’ (an ad loop telling lies about how great Europcar is) which clearly no one answers) where I was on hold over 30’ before I gave up. Worst customer experience ever. Will never use rentalcar.com or Europcar ever again.</div>

                <div class='text'>Very disappointed
I was requested under pressure to pay extra £71.40 as “After Hours” fee when we arrived Birmingham airport for car collection.
Due to a flight delay, we arrived at 11:04 PM—just 4 minutes past office hours
We did promptly call their office at 7:30pm (UK time) in Italy before departure once we knew there was flight delay. This staff, who is on duty, confirmed he could wait up to 30 minutes beyond the usual closing time – until 11:30 PM. We expressed our deep appreciation in phone.
Before making the car booking, we contacted your Customer Service team to clarify what would happen in the event of a flight delay, given that your office hours end at 11:00 PM. We were assured that, as long as we provided our flight number, your staff would monitor our arrival and wait for us accordingly. Based on this reassurance, we proceeded with the booking and submitted our flight information
We explained our situation and referenced the prior conversation with that staff. However, he remained adamant. When we requested an official policy document justifying this charge, he became defensive, accused us of being impolite, and refused to provide any documentation. He then stated that unless we paid the fee, he would close the office and WITHOUHOLD the car.
Adding to our discomfort, before demanding the late fee, this staff spent over five minutes trying to upsell us additional insurance. We informed him that we had already purchased full coverage. He replied confidently—but misleadingly—that full coverage did not include wheels and tires, and pressured us to purchase more coverage. When we declined, his attitude changed abruptly, and he immediately brought up the “After Hours” charge.
Lastly, when we arrived at 11:04 PM, the staff member had just finished completing the documentation for the previous customer. He was not simply waiting in the office for serving us.
I fully agree that flight delay was not Europcar’s fault and was not their responsible for this either.
However, they did not keep promise and still charged us after failing to sell us insurance, simply because we were only 4 minutes late.
They not only refused to issue a refund, but also failed to provide any documentation justifying the 'late charge' as per their Terms and Conditions
Please think carefully before ordering a car from them, even if their initial prices seem cheaper.</div>

                <div class='text'>The experience with the car itself was fine.

What really let me down was the treatment I received.
I arrived with my quote for the car ready, online check in completed, ready to pick up my vehicle.

Then the employee proceeded to ask me what option I wanted for insurance, giving me only two, and choosing his words deliberately making it sound like what I was choosing was the option that would leave my quote unaltered.

Perhaps there was an element of me being naive but the same thing happened to the person before me, so I tend to think it’s a tactic they use.

When it came to the payment, lo and behold, the price was DOUBLED.
So, when they give you insurance options, make sure to ask what ALL your options are, and make sure to specify that you want the cheapest/no additional insurance. Otherwise they will try to take you for all you’re worth.

That’s without even mentioning the lack of care, they are supposed to come out and show you the car’s features, how to use it, etc.
Mine was an EV which I had never used before, he just gave me the keys and sent me on my way.

Overall extremely negative experience.</div>

My insurance company gave me a rental car from Europcar for a week in September 2024. Everything went smooth and handed back the car with no issues. After 7 months my insurance company had called me saying that Europcar have put a claim through mentioning there is a chip on the windscreen! They blamed me for it after 7 months which surely doesn’t make sense! You have customers all the time using your vehicle so how can they accuse me for it? They didn’t call me or send me anything and next thing you know I have been charged £619.89 on my credit card out of nowhere without consent. No mention from them for this charge at all. This is fraud!!!! Avoid these scammers! I have called them up and they just mention they have put a dispute in. 1 week later no call back nothing. They have stolen my money!</div>

                <div class='text'>I wish I'd read the Reviews here before ever using Europcar @ London Stansted Airport & wish I could give a negative score! We had never hired a vehicle before & could almost see ££s signs in the rep's eyes when he asked us. My husband did ask if the car we had booked had a Sat Nav system (Ford Focus or similar booked via Booking.com) & were told that only new electric cars had these. He then went into back office & bought out 2 sets of keys for a Hyundai Kona & a Volvo car - no sign of our original request!! After being bombarded with insurance information & other additional charges told that the insurance already taken out with Booking.com was useless, so told to take out their additional insurance - even charged more for the One-Way charge than anticipated - altogether had to pay an additional £400 for a car we didn't request or need!!! We weren't even shown to the car or shown around the vehicle to check for any damage & it was getting dark by the time we finished with the reams of paperwork. We didn't even know how to start the car initially & had to figure out how to operate the Sat Nav ourselves! The final figure on the Rental Agreement was deducted from my husband's bank account but then adjusted after leaving the Desk. All in all - a totally traumatic experience, which was unexpected & we left shell-shocked. I think the staff are trained to confuse customers into signing up for additional services that they do not want or need. I think that they make customers feel cheap & uneducated if they question the explanation for additional services. I wouldn't recommend this company to my worst enemy. I contacted Booking.com with these details and think they are aware of their practices as they refunded the insurance that I took with them without any questions & advised that the deposit (which we didn't know would be deducted either) would be returned within 28 days but not much else. PLEASE DO NOT HIRE VEHICLES FROM THEM - we will never ever use them.</div>

                <div class='text'>AWFUL FROM START TO FINISH.

I hired a van for the day, on a Saturday, to help a family member move house. I paid nearly £80 for the pleasure, along with a £100 deposit and £36 insurance upgrade. The collection process was simple and straight forward, and the bloke who helped me was nice. However, I was told I would need to leave the van in a nearby carpark when I was done with it, as there was no where else to leave it out of hours, but that it would be picked up at 1pm on the Sunday (the following day). Fair enough, although it would have been useful to know this upon booking. I dropped the van off 3 hours before my rental period ended at 7pm on the Saturday, and paid for the parking until the next day (as advised by the staff member) for 12 hours at nearly £8. I received a return statement and invoice on the Monday to say that I was being charged an additional £114.45 as I didn’t hand the car back until the Monday! I contacted customer via phone and email, and sent proof of my drop off, the carpark receipt and all additional info I had to and they essentially fobbed me off and told me it was my fault and that I had indeed dropped the car off on the Monday. They explicitly said I had been charged correctly. They then stopped replying to my emails. I phoned the branch where I hired the van from and they accepted that they had wrongly charged me BUT it took almost 4 weeks to get my money back, and in total I spoke to 6 different people who were useless at helping me. I kept being told ‘it should be with you soon, call back in 2 days’. Overall, a horrific service and unless you push and press them, they are reluctant to accept fault and refund you. I didn’t get one apology during this experience. DO NOT USE THEM.</div>

                <div class='text'>Our car was damaged on the Friday and the insurance put, us in touch with Europcar for a hire car until the car was repaired the following Monday. We were told they would contact us to take the £1 deposit and get us a car. We heard nothing from them. We made several calls to organise a car but, never got a car or even a call back from them. When we were told our car may not be repaired by then end of Monday, we contacted Europcar again and they told us they would deliver a car to us by 5pm. The car never arrived. Luckily our car was repaired by 2pm. We did not cancel the hire car. It just never turned up and Europcar haven't even bothered to contact us. We called them to make a complaint and they gave a number to call to make a complaint. We called that number and the woman was quite snotty and would not take the complaint.</div>

                <div class='text'>Hirer beware!
Make sure that you take photos/videos of the car when you pick it up.Unfortunately I didn’t before leaving Knock Airport.
When I returned the car after 3 days low mileage trips in Mayo the person inspecting the car drew my attention to a mark on the alloy wheel.Despite my assurance that I had not had any accidents with the car she had to report the 2” mark. I assumed that I would hear no more about it but on my next credit card statement I discovered that without any notification they had deducted €391 to cover the cost of repair. My insurance company asked me to submit an invoice for the repair but Europcar admitted that the wheel would probably not be repaired and that €391 was an estimated cost! WhenI showed a photo of the damage to my local body repairers in Rochdale they estimated €70 as a true cost. Europcar Knock will never again get my custom and I return to Ireland every summer.</div>

                <div class='text'>I hired a large van to move some items all in all around 30miles. I needed it on a Saturday and this was the only company with availability. I booked it on the Thursday beforehand. Booked the van from 10:00am-22:00pm on Saturday and was charged £71.45 which I thought was fairly reasonable. Noticed when booking that a charge would be added after as I would be returning the van out of hours. I called Europcar to ask how much this charge would be and was told £20. I asked for this info to be emailed to me in case they tried to charge more later. They said they couldn't provide this info in writing which made me nervous but I needed to go ahead with the booking. The next day (Friday) I had a phone call from them saying that the van I had booked was not available but they could offer me a smaller one. I declined as had to move a sofa. They said it was OK and they would make sure the van was available for my booking the next day. Saturday we arrived at Europcar at 10am but there was nowhere to park at all - it was a tiny site with cars/vans everywhere. I ended up dropping off my partner and parking at the shop down the street. He was waiting for about 15 minutes till he got served and was told the van wasn't ready. He had already checked in online but they wanted all of his details again. Clearly they needed to waste time as the van wasn't ready. They asked for the payment card so I had to go back and provide this, they made a comment to my partner saying something along the lines of 'we will cancel this whole thing off until she gets here and then start again' - my partner said 'no that is not necessary she is parked 30 seconds away - keep it on the screen she will be here now'. I arrived and they took all of my details and tried to sell me insurance. I said that the basic will be fine as we are travelling very local. They proceeded to try and scaremonger me into taking the insurance but I said no. At this point it was about 11am and they were cleaning the van. I said that I want a discount as the van wasn't ready 1 hour after my booking time. They said as a gesture of goodwill that I could have the van until the following day. I said this is no use to me, I am doing 1 trip - I want you to waive the £20 key drop-off out of hours fee and they said they would 'try'. So far, I haven't been charged this but wouldn't be surprised if it comes out of my account in the next few days. Would not recommend at all. Problem at every stage. Should have read reviews before booking. Even if you're in dire need I would go elsewhere.</div>

                <div class='text'>Terrible, avoid! Returned a car to discover it had a crack in the windscreen. No point of impact so was obviously caused by the cold weather which is common in weakly manufactured screens. Sure enough searching the car make and cracked windscreen shows other drivers had this problem. Despite there being no impact damage, no surrounding scratches etc just a clean crack they are insisting its damage not a defect. They are asking for £900. I did take out insurance elsewhere but they wont cover manufacturing defects. Complete lack of care from them means I wont be using them in the future.</div>

                <div class='text'>Worst experience of my life.

I didn't take out additional insurance, and I returned my car to bristol airport after a flawless drive and signed off on the tablet to confirm that all was fine. The staff at the car return looked over the car and didn't raise any issue. I then received a damage notification followed by a £100 bill for a 'light scuff' on one wheel, (which wasn't caused by me). I was shown no proof that this was not there before my rental and as much as I did check the car for dents/scrapes on the doors, bumpers etc (Bearing in mind it was dark at almost 11pm at night when I collected the car), I did not get down on my hands and knees with a torch to check the car tyres, if I had done I would have seen that this 'light scuff' was already there. At the time of returning the car I signed the tablet with no mention of any damage by staff even after they had walked around and inspected the car.
I contacted customer services and was simply told that 'any damage needed to have been reported before hand'. Will never use this company again and strongly advise others to avoid as I feel I have been victimised and ripped off for failing to take out additional insurance.</div>

                <div class='text'>BEWARE!!!! These guys are a broker or third party so sell you insurance, but it's a claim back policy (?!). I thought I was getting it all through Europcar. However, Europcar tried to upsell me their insurance - even though when you do manage to read through DiscoverCars policy - it says you are covered. But Europcar then ask you to fully cover the car with a credit card - in my case, 1800Euros which if you don't have a credit card it's more on a debit card- around another 25euros a day. It was exhausting - the operative at Europcar also said she had never heard of DiscoverCars - even though the bus was outside with both their logos on and if you Google them - they say they are partners! I ended up having to get a cab. The whole thing exhausting and leaves you feeling like fresh meat to be plundered!</div>

                <div class='text'>I have used Europcar several times and never had any problems with them, until the rental car I had last summer was damaged by a third party. This third party admitted responsibility and I filed a damage report following Europcars instructions. They had all the details of the driver causing the damage and I assumed that was the end of the issue. However, sometime later I received a claim for payment of the damage from Europcar. I explained the situation but they had no record of my damage report. The alarm bells should have started ringing then. I had to pay the 850 pounds damages, while they claimed the money from the driver responsible and I have still not been refunded some 8 months later. I have been passed from department to department, emailing on average once a month to try and resolve the issue. The driver that caused the damage has told me his insurance company case number and as far as he is concerned the matter is closed and his insurance has paid, but I have not received any money. I will continue to email Europcar, but I am wondering if I will ever get my money back. The only thing I am sure of, is that I will definitely think twice before renting with them again!

Guess what? I contacted customer services and according to them the case was closed!! I have been instructed to email them again. Feel like I am banging my head against a brick wall!!!</div>

                <div class='text'>I had an absolutely terrible experience with Europcar, particularly with their insurance, claims, and customer service departments. They were consistently unhelpful, gave misleading information, and showed a complete lack of professionalism.

I was repeatedly told that documents would be sent by a certain date, only for them to fail to follow through. They say one thing and then do another, making the entire process frustrating and unnecessarily drawn out.

Their inability to provide accurate information and their poor communication made resolving the issue a nightmare. I would strongly advise avoiding Europcar for any car rental – the hassle just isn’t worth it.</div>

                <div class='text'>Do not use Europcar in the uk, hired the car, took out additional cover which we were told at collection at Edinburgh airport, would cover any tyre damage. Have since been hounded by their collection for $300.00 to replace a tyre, I have provided the additional insurance cover document but have now been told, it doesn’t cover tyre, why else would I have taken out the additional cover. Previous when in the UK, I had a puncture when using Sixt and it was no problem and covered without any additional insurance. Now they have charged my credit card. I have never used Europcar before and will never again, my fault as I had heard of this happening to other travellers.</div>

                <div class='text'>Had the car for a week but on the first day one of the tyres dropped pressure so topped it up but it happened again 2 days later so called and they booked it in for a new tyre. Handed the car back and then a few days later was told I was liable for the tyre as I hadn’t reported the slow puncture within 24 hours of getting the car initially. At no point when I was sorting the new tyre did they say I was liable for a slow puncture and they have been totally unreasonable. They refused to complete a fault check on the car to show when the tyre pressure fault was initially recorded on the car and seem to think that a slow puncture would be obvious within 24 hours. If you ever are in the unfortunate position of having to deal with this awful company then accept they will screw you over and send you a bill for £180 for one tyre. I did the right thing and got the tyre changed even though I could easily have just pumped it up and handed it back to them and then they would have had to sort it which is what they did to me. No common sense and a an absolute rip off. Also told that this is classed as insurance claim, I hope the useless complaints person is wrong about this as it is totally ridiculous. Avoid this company unless you accept they will rip you off at any opportunity.</div>

                <div class='text'>I am writing to formally lodge a complaint regarding my recent experience with Europcar.

Booking and Payment Details
I booked my rental car at the same time as my easyJet flights. The total rental amount was £91.00, and an additional £50.00 was paid for waiver protection. (Supporting details attached.)

Initial Interaction at Rental Counter
Upon arrival to collect the car, the representative at the counter inquired whether I had rented with Europcar previously. I informed them that I had, but had a negative experience regarding fuel charges, despite refueling the car minutes before returning it. I was forced to raise a complaint and provide proof of my fuel purchase in order to receive a refund. The representative apologized and offered me a free upgrade for my current rental.

Rental Agreement and Holding Deposit
I was presented with the rental agreement, which clearly indicated the prepaid amount of £91.00, as well as an additional charge of £86.90, which was explained to me as a holding deposit. I questioned this charge, and it was reaffirmed as a holding deposit, which would be refunded to my card upon the return of the vehicle. This conversation was witnessed by my colleague, who was traveling with me at the time.

Fuel Refill and Return of Vehicle
Prior to returning the vehicle, I refueled the car with 6.91 liters of petrol, totalling £9.66, at the nearest garage to the airport (PA3 2TH), as per the attached receipt. Upon returning the vehicle, I handed the keys to a Europcar representative named Jack, who inspected the vehicle, including its mileage and fuel levels. He confirmed that everything was in order and that no issues were present.

Unjust Charges
On March 21, 2025, I received an invoice for additional charges, including a Premium Station Surcharge and a charge for 6 liters of fuel. Furthermore, my credit card has been charged an additional £98.85 on top of the original rental charge of £91.00.

These charges are clearly erroneous, unjustified, and appear to be fraudulent.

I hereby request that the excess charge of £98.85 be refunded immediately to my credit card.

Additionally, I wish to file a formal complaint against both the employee who processed my rental and the representative to whom I returned the vehicle. Their actions were misleading and resulted in fraudulent charges being placed against me.

I expect prompt resolution of this matter. Should this issue remain unresolved, I will be forced to take further action to protect my interests.</div>

Again.
I hired a van over a weekend to move some household things.
When I got to my destination I noticed one of the side trims had fallen off the Van.
When I returned the van on a Sunday there was no one on site to complain to.
I received a notice that I would be charged for the value of the repair despite paying for extra insurance.
Totally unacceptable views when I complained they said it’s my responsibility to check all the trim and accessories are firmly connected to the van. What the hell europecar, if I hire a vehicle from you I’m not going to spend 2 hours giving it a full MOT before I drive it off the car park.
End result I’ve been billed an extra £230 for a £80 piece of trim which they’ve clearly inflated the cost of and charged me. A £45 admin charge.
I hope this lets europecar know there is a growing band of unhappy customers out there. We keep your company in profit, you need to start listening to us.</div>

                <div class='text'>I hired a car through EasyJet in innsbruch, Austria. On returning the car, the car hire people told me that there were two scratches on the door and bumper and the total repair cost would be Euro 2100. The excess payable is limited to Euro975, but the car hire people say that this excess is per scratch, making it possible that you would end up paying more than the car is worth. This seems utterly bizarre. No one in Europcar seems to understand how quoting for work works, let alone their own insurance policies. This position is not resolved and is ongoing.</div>

I liked you during our convesration but your comopany thinks it can put arbitary charges on customerss without evidence??

I will let Mobilo deal with this as I am sure it is happening a lot from my research.

I have no wish to use your company either now or in the future.</div>

                <div class='text'>Europcar at London Stansted is running a scam to fraudulently charge customers for extras they explicitly refuse. I clearly stated FIVE times that I did not want the premium cover, yet they added it anyway without my consent.

The agent, Fred, even lied to my face, telling me the extra charge was just the rental deposit—when in reality, it was the premium cover I had rejected. Later, he even called me for feedback, completely unaware that he had charged me for the cover! This proves that Europcar is either incompetent or deliberately deceiving customers to steal their money.

When I complained, Europcar’s customer service dismissed my case, simply stating that I had signed the contract—completely ignoring the fact that I was misled and scammed into doing so. This is outright fraud.

I will be reporting Europcar to UK Trading Standards, disputing the charge with my credit card provider, and will continue leaving reviews until this issue is resolved. Avoid Europcar at all costs unless you want to be scammed!</div>

                <div class='text'>I had an extremely frustrating experience with Europcar UK due to unjust charges and a lack of accountability.

First, I was charged over £100 for roadside assistance, which was never properly explained at the rental desk as a daily fee instead of a one-time charge. Had this been made clear, I would have declined or opted for full insurance, which would have been a far better choice. Instead, I was rushed into signing multiple documents without any real explanation.

Even worse, I was charged over £200 for a faulty tyre that developed a bubble after just 215 miles over 8 days—something that shouldn’t happen with a properly maintained vehicle. This raises serious concerns about Europcar’s safety standards. It seems that Europcar relies on renters purchasing insurance to cover defective or substandard parts, knowing they can shift the cost to insurance companies rather than ensuring vehicles are well-maintained. Those who decline extra coverage are left footing the bill for Europcar’s own negligence.

Hoping for fair treatment, I escalated this to BVRLA, expecting them to step in. But rather than questioning Europcar’s practice of shifting costs onto customers, BVRLA chose to focus only on Europcar’s paperwork, avoiding any real attempt to hold them accountable. This approach allows Europcar to continue misleading and overcharging customers without consequences.

Renters deserve better—clear terms, properly maintained vehicles, and fair business practices. Not hidden charges, misleading explanations, and financial penalties for defects that aren’t their fault.</div>

                <div class='text'>I had booked to pick up a car with Europcar at Birmingham Airpot in England through an online website. I found the sales person very arrogant he refused me the saying they could not verify me through there credit agency search. Which I found difficult to understand considering I had taken a car from the same location twice in the past few months prior to the last refused rental.

Nevertheless I got charged for the rental, I was told that as Europcar didn’t take me payment the third party will refund the money. I got the feeling it’s because I was happy to sign the contract even after been told that I would be liable to the damage to the car because I refused to take out any extra add insurance from them, because this same person who stated they could not find my name on a credit check was present the last time I rented from that branch and I refused to take extra insurance from them. I actually choose Europcar because I believed it to be a reputable company, never again.</div>

                <div class='text'>Car rental for christmas in Cork, booked via HolidayCars. I bought a CD waver insurance policy which I showed at the desk on collection of the car. I had to use my debit card instead of a credit card as the PIN had been changed by my wife. Apparently using my debit card meant that I had to take compulsory and very expensive CD insurance that increased the cost by 112 euros. This was not exp[lained to me at the desk. On return I was invoiced for this extra amount and emailed their support. This was answered that I had signed the agreement when renting so nothing could be done. My point is that I cannot read the full agreements when renting a car especially when stressed to get to my final destination and with a queue behind me. I had bought a policy to cover the excess so clearly did not want or need extra insurance. I think that Europcar should have refunded this charge but they stopped replying to my follow up emails. I regard this as misleading me. Poor.</div>

We chose europ car through rentalcars.com to rent a car for 4 days. It was supposed to be £125 for 2 people plus insurance. On arrival to pick car up the person behind the counter tried to charge us extra insurance without us saying yes. This would have been £100 extra!!!!! Luckily we realised before we made transaction. After we collected car we realised that we also were charged £55 for second driver. Then we realised that on our bank statement we were charged twice for the rental. We are now having the misfortune of having to claim the money this second payment back , which means you have to jump through hoops finding bank statements and proof of over charge even though they can see for themselves we were double charged …. AVOID!</div>

                <div class='text'>Rip off!!!!

Got cheap car rental through Booking.com for Europcar. Even paid an additional amount on the booking for full insurance for a 7 day hire.

Arrived at Fuerteventura airport and was told that the full insurance wasn’t any good as it was taken through a third party. They sold me the full insurance for €285 on top of what I had already paid!!!!! This ensured that any damage would be waived.

Picked up the car and noticed a few marks on it - I wasnt bothered as I had full cover.

Returned the car after 7 days, and with no damage to it. They scoured the car and told me I’d damaged the rear of the car (I hadn’t). Luckily I’d taken out their rip off insurance, so I could walk away worry free.

Can’t help but feel there’s some sort of scam going on here.

Stay away!!!!!</div>

                <div class='text'>Terrible Experience with Europcar UK – Misleading Practices and Unauthorised Charges

I had a deeply disappointing experience with Europcar UK during my recent car rental. I booked a car for my family trip from 20th December 2024 to 20th January 2025 and paid in full (GBP 1,639.81) upfront. However, the problems began as soon as I arrived at the Gatwick Airport North Terminal after a 30-hour flight from Brisbane.

Despite explicitly informing the staff that I did not require additional insurance because I have Allianz Travel Insurance covering rental car excess, I was handed a document to sign under the pretense of providing a security deposit. Later, I discovered it was a completely new rental agreement with added charges for unwanted insurance and a so-called "free upgrade" to a Peugeot PG5008. The upgrade was presented as complimentary because the originally booked MG HS was unavailable, yet I was later charged for it.

Upon returning the car at Heathrow Airport, I was unexpectedly charged GBP 20 for cleaning without prior disclosure. The staff claimed it was because the car floor required more than five minutes to clean. This charge was never mentioned in the rental agreement.

After returning to Australia, I discovered an unauthorized charge of AUD 3,889.19 on my credit card, labeled as a second rental payment. I immediately contacted Europcar but received only an automated response. Despite multiple follow-ups, I was given no proper explanation or resolution.

To make matters worse, I noticed additional unexplained charges of GBP 45 each on 12th and 13th February 2025. Again, these charges were processed without my consent and with no justification provided.

This experience has highlighted Europcar's lack of transparency, misleading practices, and poor customer service. I strongly advise others to avoid Europcar if they want a stress-free and honest rental experience.</div>

                <div class='text'>Booked in advance online for £139 - they ended up stinging me for another £600 when I went to collect the car at the airport. Half of this was an additional insurance premium to avoid paying a €2,500 excess, the other two charges called variously emergency management fees and a special location surcharge (the special location being the airport). I was forced into signing the contract as I had a pre-booked place on a ferry and no time to argue about it. No-one with enough English to explain. No come back from customer services. Total cost during my holiday €4 per kilometre.AVOID, AVOID, AVOID

                <div class='text'>Never trust Europcar, their employees and their processes. They all are waiting for the opportunity to manipulate and deceive you to earn cheap money and commissions. After returning the vehicle I noticed on my invoice that an extra charge of amount £223.04 has been applied to my bank account (in the name of 'Premium protection'). I never asked to add any additional service on top of the booking amount of £ 327.35 which was paid already at the time of booking (before even using the rental service). If I need any additional services, I always make sure that everything is in place and paid for to avoid any surprises and to keep a track of by expense and budget.
I clearly mentioned "NO" multiple times for any additional services to Europe car rental agent (It must be recorded on their camera).
Even when I said "NO" multiple times to any kind of additional services, Europcar's agent printed 'Premium protection agreement' papers without informing me and put in front of me to get my signature with other many agreement documents which is really deceiving and manipulating the valuable customer and forcing unnecessary extra charges to the customers while they are trusting the process. When I explained the situation to them and asked for refund, they denied. Never ever going to book from them. I request you all to avoid such shameless deceivers instead of getting deceived.</div>

                <div class='text'>Do not use Europcar and if you do be prepared to pay over twice the price agreed. I arranged to hire a car before leaving the UK for my holiday in Mexico and when I got there they would not release the car unless I bought a further insurance that doubled the cost of the car. The other people that also did the same as me, trying to collect their car, where also being fleeced by Europcar. I raised this on Facebook and Europcar requested I take this issue off Facebook and they would sort it out for me. If they offer this, do not believe them.. This is all a con. Never use them they are crocked.
I tried the customer service who sounded like they would try and help. They asked a lot of questions and then went to sleep. I tried to email them and they just ignored me. I think that customer service is there just to string you out in the hope that you will just go away.</div>

                <div class='text'>Europcar Oxford tried to scam me of money for some damages were already on the car.

Short story.
On pick up they offered their insurance that would double the rental price and I refused. They bought the car outside and I asked for the existing damages report on the car that I was not provided with and I’ve been told that they are aware of all damages and I will not get charged for them. I took a video of the car in many angles that saved me probably paying over 1000£ in damages fees.
On drop off the guy looked around the car for 1 minute the came to me and said that everything is ok and I will receive my deposit back in 4-5 days, I left and then the scammer went back to the car took photos of 2 scratches and added them to the drop off report and said that they were new ones. I never found out until one week later when I received an email from europcar with the claim against me for 2 scratches on the car. I asked for the drop off report and I couldn’t believe when I saw the pictures of the scratches in the drop off report.
I cannot stress enough telling you how important it is to have videos and photos taken on the start of a hire as they will do everything they can to take some money off you.

                <div class='text'>I paid comprehensive insurance while overseas only to get to Europcar Heathrow and be told the car I had rented wasn't available and I had to pay extra insurance. I was given only two options either an upgrade where I had to pay more or an electric car which the guy by the counter said was a bad idea since I was going to drive outside of the UK. I asked why the car I had fully paid wasn't available but got no answer instead the guy would go and talk to his colleagues and then come back trying to make small talk. So after my 23 hour flight the only car available was an expensive upgrade. I was then billed and few days later got a refund then when I returned the car I was billed again.</div>

They don't give you the car you paid for online.
Put pressure to buy extra insurance for free upgrade.

They do not mention prices are excluding VAT.

On final bill you receive charges such as Environmental contribution (euro 3) Premium Station (euro 42) which are never mentioned at the time of renting.

After a long flight, nobody reads the small print on the contract they make customers sign, then end up with a bill three times the rental price.

Be very careful or ideally avoid this company.

UPDATE: 4 Feb 2025
This company is a joke. They send a reply to the bottom of Trustpilot message. The link takes you to a department who then refers you to the initial department you made the complaints to.

From my end, I informed the HR of our company who stopped working with them, circulated my experience with them on Facebooks so friends are aware and will be mentioning their behavior in every opportunity.</div>

                <div class='text'>AVOID EUROPCAR CAR AT ALL COST
There are many hire companies out there, but sadly Europcar is not the one to use and I would definitely never recommend them or use them ever. I had a hire vehicle from them through my insurance company and 11 days after the vehicle was off hired I received a text message saying they were investigating damage that illedgely happened in my hire period.
11 days later, a text..not even a phone call, and definitely something I am not responsible for. You can't of course speak to a human on the phone, as their complaints procedure only allows there staff to hind behind a keyboard, firing off emails and texts.
Interestingly enough, when you scan social media, I don't appear to be an isolated complaint, and theirs too many customer experiences that suggest them taking money from people's accounts for "damage".. this would appear to be a bit of a buisness trend for them..
I can only give you the benefit of my experience, and I would never deal with them again or encourage anyone to use there service.
D××× Turpin at least, wore a mask.</div>

                <div class='text'>My insurance hired me a car as my disability car is being repaired at no fault of my own but after a few weeks they asked for the car back, that’s fine so I had it cleaned inside and out that cost me £40 so I didn’t get anything to say it wasn’t clean and the fact I’m a nice person always give it back in same condition and I filled the tank to its capacity literally went over the full tank line BUT yesterday received a text stating I owe them £54.53 for fuel !!
Thank god I took photographs and they were dated as they trying to pull a fast one !! I’m not paying for fuel when I had already filled it .. not my problem what your collection driver done when he left my property!!
The customer services is terrible takes over an hour to speak to anyone and even then they are not interested just say email us with your concerns … absolute joke .. I emailed over 30 hours ago and have nothing back yet. No doubt someone will reply to this with “contact us” no you contact me as your in the wrong.</div>

                <div class='text'>Booked Mercedes A class arrived to find didn’t have so getting ‘free upgrade’ to …. a Nissan? Queried to be told I was getting bigger car, an SUV, so it was an upgrade. Advised it was just me so didn’t want an SUV as driving 500 miles would rather the premium brand for comfort. Told they had other Mercedes but they don’t give them for one way rentals (charged extra £78 for one way) so it was take the Nissan or nothing.

In addition to drivers licence, DVLA share code and credit card all which was expected, I was then required to provide a passport (provided UK licence) and then told they would do a credit check - don’t know if checking for bankruptcy, CCJ or credit limit to value of vehicle?

Won’t be using Europcar again

                <div class='text'>If I could give them ZERO stars, I would. We booked a car online (medium sized) via Booking.com
When we arrived (jet lagged & exhausted after the long flight from Australia), the guy said that the car we had booked wouldn't serve our purposes as we were doing a lot of driving. As per another review, you're a target because you're tired and you just want to get a car and get going.
Long story short: we ended being "upgraded" (supposedly at some discounted cost), but out of pocket an extra GBP1400!! In hindsight, my husband made the observation that when we were talking to the guy about our booking, he had 3 sets of keys in front of him. We figure (in hindsight), that one set was the car we actually booked, the second was a slight upgrade and the third was the set for suckers like us. And, like another reviewer, the upsell about insurance: no, what we had paid for online was not of any use, blah, blah. Then, when we finally get out to the car and ask for some help with how it all operates , they send out some young guy who knew little more than us. We got absolutely NO help working out how to get the GPS to work - when you put in an intended address, after a minute the screen would disappear and the message would come up, something along the lines of "You need to pay a subscription". What??? After a week of using our own data on our 'phones due to this limitation (and stopping in at two more car hire offices to try and get help with it, without success), we discovered if we went through another field/screen, the map displayed would actually stay live and not disappear. Fancy having to work that out for yourself, and having the frustration of that limitation for a week, when the company can't help you. (No car manual in the car).
Also, like other reviewers, I WISH I HAD READ THESE REVIEWS BEFORE BOOKING!! Additionally, in talking to a friend, she had the same type of pressure to upgrade (although she stuck to her guns) with this company in NEW ZEALAND. This must be part of their policy and company training!! Maybe they get commission if they upsell?
Would NEVER rent through them again.</div>

                <div class='text'>I had a terrible experience at the branch in Maidstone on 23rd January 2025. My car, booked for 8:00 AM, wasn’t ready, and I was told I’d have to wait until 3:00 PM. The excuse? I booked the night before after closing—which the system allowed without warning.

After waiting nearly an hour, they tried to upsell me a replacement car for £20 more per day. I refused, and the manager eventually approved it at no extra cost, but I was then charged £12–£13 daily for insurance instead. Adding to the chaos, payment delays due to system issues made the process feel rushed and unprofessional.

My order number was 1185232517. This experience was stressful, disruptive, and unacceptable. I wouldn’t recommend this branch.</div>

                <div class='text'>Our experience with Europcar turned out to be the most expensive and frustrating car rental we've ever had.

We chose Europcar because their website advertised the Volvo C40. However, upon arrival, the promised car was unavailable. The pick-up process was extremely slow, taking about an hour just to verify ID and address. This delay forced us to reschedule our plans, turning an already busy day into a stressful nightmare.

Throughout the process, we felt bombarded with additional charges. They attempted to add fees for a "popular pickup location," premium protection, and even cleaning—despite us already paying for extensive protection coverage.

Here are some of the key issues we faced:

1. The verification procedure took about an hour. This unnecessary delay disrupted our schedule and caused significant stress.

2. As advised, we paid extra premium protection for the alternative car, thinking it was only a day of use and a premium service would give us ease of mind.

3. While some loose dog hair ended up on our coats and my wife’s trousers, it was minimal. Despite this, Europcar insisted on specialist cleaning, claiming it was required for such a minor issue. We know firsthand that dog hair can be removed quickly with a vacuum and they provide standard cleaning for customers—it certainly doesn’t justify specialist cleaning fees. Plus we used other rental services and this was never an issue

4. The rental was advertised at approximately £120, yet by the end, we were charged over £200 for just one day of use. We ultimately had to involve Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) to contest the cleaning fee.

Regardless of the ADR outcome, we will never use Europcar again and strongly advise others to avoid their service. Renting from Europcar resulted in wasted time, unexpected stress, and substantial additional costs. And please save your reply by saying we need to send an email to your customer service team. We just got their reply. They said it was the final decision to use specialist cleaning service to remove some loose dog hair.</div>

                <div class='text'>Was falsely charged two fees; one for a delay returning the car which was caused by Europcar taking TWO hours to return a call for extending the rental - a call that they said would be "within 15 minutes". Then they added on an extra day rental for 53 minutes late return when it was due to their own delay in calling me.

I suspect the delay in call back was in order to force the delay and make the extra charge. Very suspicious.

They then refused to remove that price with a customer service agent who presumably was provided by Little Britain.

In addition, there was a hidden charge for a "premium" drop-off location, which was not in the original agreement or detailed at collection.

I'll soon to be making my feelings clear to over five million users on social media.

Avoid this misleading, fraudulent company which does not value customers and would rather charge for a 53-minute delay in which THEY caused.

You should, though, perhaps also feel bad for Europcar because they are so desperate for money they insist on charging £25 incorrectly than settle this issue.

* Edit: Europcar have responded to this review informing me to contact customer service. Which I have already done. And which they would already know if they had read my review. Further compounding their uselessness by proving they literally do not listen to what the customer has said.</div>

                <div class='text'>Fraud!! What a complete scam at the check in desk. I reserved a car with easycar and paid for an additional driver, and standard insurance. At the Europcar collection desk they offered me the insurance upgrade and I declined, so they said how about instead of the additional driver charge I give you the full insurance so your total costs is almost the same. Sure ok that's a good deal to me. To my surprise when I return and review my credit card bill I have 2 charges. 1 from easycar and 1 from Europcar, total 400 more than the price I signed up for when I booked. What a scam. I am disgusted. At least the other rental companies I have used from Manchester airport have never done anything like this.

Updated in response to your comment below: I had raised it on email already and it remains unresolved. You informed me to go speak to EasyCar about the additional driver charge, which indicates your guy had no authority to do what he did and say 'how about we waive the additional driver charge and use that to top up the insurance instead'. Complete scam, I have contacted the bank re unauthorsied charges on my CC. You shouldn't be allowed to operate like this. It's theft.

By the way, did you know that Trust Pilot can actually connect you with me if you really want to resolve it. I guess so.</div>

                <div class='text'>My parents booked a car for us via a third party to collect from Manchester airport. From the outset it felt like an elaborate scam.

Even though my dad had plaid for excess protection via the third party we were told it wouldn't cover it and we needed to pay again.

Nobody showed me around the car at pickup. I was just left to work it all out at 5am after a 27 hour flight.

Then there were endless additional changes for this 'premium location', non of which were communicated in advance.

Upon return we were charged over $100NZD to vacuum a little bit of dirt off the rear mats (this was a two week hire and my kids had been careful... It was honestly nothing that a regular between-hire clean would need to deal with)

Over a month later I'm still trying to get back the remainder of my security deposit.

Avoid this business

EDIT:

The canned response below (the same one added to every negative review here) offers me the chance to contact customer services. I already have done this. I've written multiple emails, lodged a complaint, all to no avail. Charges were upheld and nothing more done except empty 'apologies'.

The litany of poor reviews here repeat the same issues and experience that I had. No action seems to be taken to improve things, so I reiterate: Avoid them.</div>

                <div class='text'>AVOID THIS COMPANY
I hired a car for 2 days from Alicante aiport. On the morning I was meant to return the veichle and catch my flight back to the UK, there was a problem with my fob key. It was completley
dead, I couldn't start the car. It was 3.30 in the morning. I was now panicking as I had a flight to catch. Eventually myself and family managed to get a taxi. I dropped the key back to the office but with no time to call the 24 hr breakdown line. The office still closed. I nearly missed my flight, it was very stressful.
As soon as I landed back in UK, I called europcar to explain the situation. Worst Customer service they were so unorganised and unhelpful. I had no apology for the inconvenience. To my horror I then get a email invoice to say that they were charging me another €180 for breakdown recovery and a surcharge. This is utterly unacceptable. This was through no fault of my own. They should be compensating me! I only hired the veichle for 2 day. Costing my a whopping €200 euro with fully comprehensive insurance, which I assumed would cover you for any breakdown during your rental. I would advise anyone to never use this company utterly apporling treatment.</div>

                <div class='text'>The worst, utterly disgraceful, experience I've ever had hiring a car. I booked a manual for two days, went to collect it from the Victoria London branch. I mentioned I only needed it for one day but had to book it for two as there was no mention online I could drop it off after hours on the day I needed it. The manager told me I could have booked it for one day. As compensation, as he added he couldn't change the booking in his system (???) so he offered to upgrade me to an automatic for free so long as I dropped it off by Saturday 1pm. I agreed, signed the form and returned the car full of petrol by 1pm Saturday. I then received notification from my bank that I'd been charged two days using an automatic, plus two days insurance. I called Europcar customer service to complain. They told me as I signed the contract there was nothing they could do. Plus they refused to put me through to the Victoria branch manager or put me through to their senior manager to raise the complaint. Incensed, I then went to the Victoria Europcar shop to explain to the manager the booking error. He wasn't there. I went again and again and again, three times he still wasn't there. These three times I explained to the Victoria staff in the manager's absence the mishap that had happened. Each time the staff I spoke to told me they'd get the manager to call me to sort out the mis-booking. The manager never called me. The fourth time I arrived at the Victoria branch, the manager was finally there, but kept me waiting 1/2hr before he turned up to talk to me. He looked surprised at my appearance and said he'd heard nothing about my complaint from any of his staff or customer services. The staff member behind me, who I'd met the day before and who'd promised to pass on my message, put his head in his hands. We knew perfectly well the manager was lying. He then told me I was lying and had made this whole thing up. He said he never offered me a free upgrade to an automatic from a manual car. He added, as I'd signed the contract my complaint meant nothing. But the contract I signed was misleading. The sum for £164 was black bold with lots of small type around it. This amount sounded about right for a 2 day manual hire including insurance I'd agreed to add on to the initial £115 fee. Not the £320 that was actually deducted from my bank account for a two day automatic hire. The manager walked off dismissing me. I called Europcar customer service again to complain. Three times the Europcar customer service put the phone down on me. I can't tell you how unjust, dishonest, disgraceful and unsettling this experience has been. I will never hire a Europcar EVER again.</div>

                <div class='text'>Glasgow airport, Europcar and Euan the grinning con artist.

What did we rent?
My mom and I rented a Fiat 500 via a trusted German website costing us exactly EUR 175. Insurance and everything is covered by the broker. We just wanted to pick up our rental.

What happened?
At the Europcar counter we were greeted by Euan (or Ewan). He seemed like one chirpy Scotsman. To our delight he upgraded us "free of charge". What an amazing guy! We couldn't believe our luck. He said, "you definitely need something bigger where you are headed and I have just the car".

There was no mention of additional costs whatsoever.
Who wouldn't like a free upgrade when they're headed into the Scottish outback?

Some papers were elegantly shuffled around, we were told to sign here, here and here. After that we had to pop our card into the machine for the deposit and it was a done deal. Only it wasn't.

The trickery and the damage.
The upgrade was not free of charge and the additional cost of the rental was £171.86 or EUR 205. EXTRA! That's more than the initial rental booking. Both numbers look extremely similar by the way. When we inserted our card for the deposit, we in fact paid for the upgrade. That was NEVER mentioned to us. We also never paid for a deposit, which is utterly bizarre. The kicker is that we didn't receive an end of rental statement either. Also, the charge for the upgrade was not taken out until 2 weeks after the rental (06/11/24). So even if we had paid with Monzo, which shows charges instantly we would not have realised it then and there at the counter.

Of course we signed the papers and that's enough for Europcar. Why would they care? Their golden boy Euan is ripping off people by the planeloads making the rental car company a F-ton of extra money. Unfortunately our broker nor our bank couldn't help, but that's not the end of it. A quick Google search reveals that this isn't Euan's first con nor that Europcar will ever see the promised land.

BEWARE: Euan is a smirking bastard who is out to get you. Be it extra insurance you don't need or "free" upgrades.

PLEASE read what you sign.

FURTHER ACTION will be taken via BVRLA.

If you read this and were scammed as well please take action. Do not let them get away with this. We will create a case and if necessary hire a lawyer collectively. Please get in touch.

                <div class='text'>I noticed, more than a month after my rental that this company (Manchester Airport Branch) had charged for damages without any notification.
After challenging this I received excuses like your email address was incorrect, strange given that they had emailed me the booking confirmation for the same when I booked it. They also sent photos of the supposed damage, of the wheel, which could have been from any car, it did not even give enough of an image to show it was even the same colour car, apparently you cannot show the damage without an extreme close up? Also increasing my frustration on this was that I had booked what was supposed to be one of their premium cars and to be frank it was a wreck which when I complained at pick up was told "its driveable so its rentable" and "if you want to replace the best we can provide you with is this car" a car which was not a "premium car" and not in any way the same size to accommodate our Luggage.
I would strongly recommend not to use this company, I certainly won't be doing again.

                <div class='text'>I would give this company 0 stars if I could. I stupidly did not read reviews before booking and naively thought such a well known company would be better. I really just wanted to book a car for a week, pay for it, with the price quoted and safely drive to my destination. I was quoted £467 for a car for 1 week which I think is way too much anyway. After booking I rang customer service as a change in plans meant I needed an infant car seat for my 4 month old baby. This was completed over the phone, quote changed slightly. I rang and emailed customer services the day before travel and was reassured everything was as it should be. Imagine my surprise when I arrived and was told I did not have a car seat booked, just a device (apparently a legal requirement seeing as Italian people have a tendency to leave their children in cars!) So I was charged for a car seat. Then pressure sold insurance. My £467 escalated to £968 (including a £100 hold on my credit card). The rep at the desk then handed me the most disgusting, filthy car seat, absolutely not fit for a 4 month old and told us to go and find the car, with 2 suitcases, bags and a baby in a pushchair. Checked my credit card statement, final charge was £721.33 + £21.27 non sterling transaction fee 🤣.</div>

                <div class='text'>On Friday the 20th December of 2024 I booked a rental vehicle through the Easyjet website, collecting it from Europcar Manchester Airport at 3:00pm.

From the innumerous companies based in Manchester, I chose Europcar as it is a well-reputed company in the market, trustworthy and with relatively affordable prices.
According to the booking summary I did not contract any other services or extra options in addition to the car rental.

When collecting the vehicle the employee present at the time suggested me to upgrade my cover to a premium insurance, to which I said I was not interested.

Upon my answer, your employee gave me several documents to sign under the excuse they were mandatory to the conclusion of the rental contract.

The car was returned with a full tank, without any faults or damage, something that was checked by your staff at the time of delivery.

I was completely gobsmacked and furious when I received the invoice where you Europcar charged me almost double the amount that had been previously agreed.

I will bring again to your attention that I did not contract or subscribed to any extra services, neither at the time of booking nor at the time of collection.

After reading SEVERAL feedbacks from other dissatisfied customers on several internet pages, I can finally understand where the issue relies:
Because I refused the premium insurance, the employee took advantage of my apparent rush to collect the car keys and the fact that I was a foreigner and non English native, to give me the premium insurance contract to sign mixed up with other paperwork.

This is fraud, and you are accountable for it.

Unfortunately this situation, which is very difficult to prove, seems to be recurring and many customers were scammed in this way (you can find plenty similar cases here in Google Feedback, for example).

That said, my only question is:
Are your employees who, in search of commission money, deceive Europcar customers?
Or is Europcar the one encouraging employees to carry out this type of fraudulent scheme?
Until what extend are you as a company involved in this fraudulent scheme?

Either options are despicable and reprehensible.
Considering Europcar has been operating since 1949 and has a reputation to uphold, you should be ashamed of your employees actions and take responsibility for their misdeeds.

I expect nothing than a full refund covering the extra money that was abusively withdrawn from my account, and for the employees who have been carrying such fraud to be sanctioned and brought to justice.

I expect an answer from you within the next 15 days, and in the case of failure I will seek further action with legal authorities.
I will also report this matter to the GOV.UK, Trading Standards Institute and to the ECRCS.

You can fool me once, but you won't fool twice. As someone who travels to England twice a year, I will never use your services again, and I will make sure this situation is widely spread.</div>

                <div class='text'>Europcar are a bunch of sneaky money grabbing trickster thieves. They try and pressure people and scare them into spending more money on extras such as the premium protection cover which is nearly as much as the rental itself by imposing a disgraceful £1600 compulsory excess which leaves the customer no choice but to take the protection. I said i didn't want it but they then went and charged me for it anyway a week later thinking i wouldn't notice!!?? They also tried to get me to pay for fuel i might not need by trying to charge me for a full tank of fuel in advance. You say 'make sure its empty before you return it' so you expect the customer to just drive around aimlessly burning off fuel that they didn't need to pay Europcar for in the first place? They're basically a bunch of fraudulent con artists and their sneeky pressure tactics to get more money out of people is absolutely disgraceful.</div>

                <div class='text'>The practices of the London Gatwick office are completely and utterly fraudulent. I write this review so others can be armed with information and well prepared not be defrauded by this specific Europcar office of London Gatwick airport.

I rented a car on the 30th August with no additional insurance protection to cover the excess because it was already covered on my credit card insurance. I communicated this to the representative who then included medium protection on the package and completely disregarded my verbal request. He asked me to sign the back of the page which I did as it was left completely blank without any additions.

After the rental had ended I recognised I had been charged extra on my credit card although there was no follow up email from Europcar to inform of any of the charges (although my email was clearly included on the agreement). I called the office and to my shock they forwarded through the back page agreement which now had handwritten additions of the medium protection package.

Europcar, let’s be clear, this is complete and blatant fraud to change a document after it has been signed! Not only this, but I was also charged for 7 days of insurance even though the rental lasted for only 5 days! See photos on Google Review of Europcar London Gatwick for confirmation of this. This rental finally cost me almost triple the price that what was originally agreed in the initial reservation.

Therefore, I advise anyone attending the Europcar Gatwick office to follow these recommendations:
1. Record your conversation on your phone with any attendant at this office. If the attendant complains or refuses then point them to this review and ask to speak with their manager.
2. Ensure that the attendant countersigns any documents in front of you before leaving the counter. If the signature looks similar to the one I have posted on the Google review then I advise requesting a manager or another attendant to complete the rental agreement.
3. Cross out any inclusions that are not agreed to and take a photo of the main rental agreement and the back page that list additions so it can’t be changed afterwards.
4. Finally, please post your review of this office so that others can be informed of this fraudulent behaviour, and the individual perpetrators are held accountable.

Europcar: If this review means that customer check-in at the Gatwick office takes far longer than any other office then you only have yourselves to blame. I have called customer service on multiple occasions with no action being taken. I have also sent multiple emails that all have been ignored now for over 3 months, which is well over the cited 7-10 days reply time that is promised. You will find the ignored case number as #21259873. I request that a refund be issued for these unauthorised charges and that this fraudulent behaviour of Europcar staff is prevented from occurring any further, especially by the individual that signed this document. If you want to show any endeavour to remain a reputable company then I expect a prompt reply to this review via my email which you have on file. My previous experiences with Europcar have all been positive but this is appalling. It is also worth checking that in all my other rentals I have never requested insurance and I never will. Please check your records to confirm this.</div>

                <div class='text'>One journey, one evening, c. £130 miles - filled the tank up on return: £83. Clearly it hadn't been given to me full of fuel: polite email to Europcar ... reply informed me I was fortunate not to be charged more as the tank wasn't completely full when I returned it, end of case for them. Hire charge, insurance and fuel... the most expensive short journey I have ever taken! In any other walk of life, this would be simple fraud or sharp practice... Europcar, one to avoid I think...</div>

                <div class='text'>Despite renting a fully insured car from Europcar switzerland , agreement number 50873110 with the highest insurance coverage, I faced a serious safety issue due to a faulty satnav that led me over a dangerous mountain route. When I called Europcar Assistance, they failed to respond. I had to involve the police, who sent emergency services to tow the car to safety, costing me 200 CHF. To my shock, Europcar refused to cover the towing charges and provided zero support throughout the ordeal. Extremely disappointing experience with no accountability or customer support</div>

                <div class='text'>Used them 3 times there will never be a 4th time. Got stung for £45 at Southampton branch due to insurance waiver that I had already paid within the online booking fees. However the Swindon branch has topped this by generating an invoice in Dec for me hiring a van for 8 days excess mileage and a late return billing me over £500. This relates to a 3 day hire in October that was all settled and van returned on time and less excess mileage paid. After receiving emailed invoice I have contacted customer services whilst they ask branch to investigate. In the meantime the branch has taken £250 out of my bank account using my debit card that was used for the £250 security deposit in October. I managed to stop them taking another £54 from my credit card. I am beyond impressed with them. A hire before this one took 4 months and 4 phone calls and visits to sort out incorrectly billed excess mileage- make sure you take pics on collection and drop of if you really want to risk using this cowboy company!! Thanks for your pointless response below - I’d already spoken to your customer services who raised a dispute with the branch who then stole £250 from my account</div>

                <div class='text'>The staff behind the counter managed to convince me that the insurance I had pre-purchased was not adequate and that for an additional £21 I would be sufficiently covered. needless to say that he neglected to inform me that the £21 did not include tax, and was a daily rate. I realized this once the purchase had already gone through, I tried to cancel it but they weren't interested in helping me after I had handed over my money.

My complaint was ignored for two weeks before they sent me a canned response that the signature on the document was binding and this eliminated the possibility of a refund. I am now in the process of filing a complaint with an external regulatory body over their dishonest sales techniques.

I ended up paying for unnecessary insurance that cost more than 150% of the car rental itself. No one would agree to this. Please be careful of this company's deceptive sales techniques, don't let them convince you that you need to give them more than you already have. Don't sign anything unless you're certain you understand what they are telling you. And be aware that you will likely not receive help from this company once they have received your money.

UPDATE following the below response - Europcar has flatly denied my request for an investigation or a refund, requiring me to escalate the issue to a third party.

I will never use this company again.</div>

                <div class='text'>When picking up my rental car, I was repeatedly pressured to accept additional options, even though I was already fully insured through Sunny Cars, their partner company. Despite my clear refusal, I was still charged an additional €437.80 for an unnecessary extra insurance = one extra car.

Customer service (which did respond in a timely manner, so that was great) refuses to take responsibility and shows no sign of improving this process among its staff.

This is outright deception and damages trust in Europcar. Sorry but not recommended!</div>

                <div class='text'>I had an incident during my rental and reported the incident straight away. On returning the vehicle they said they would send me an invoice for the damage/excess. I had 3rd party insurance so just have the standard excess of 1600GBP with Europcar.
I have been waiting over 2 months for the invoice and have emailed and called many times and been told that they are still investigating the incident and that they will let us know.
With a deadline for claiming with the 3rd party insurance, they are causing unnecessary stress and complication for a straightforward incident.</div>

                <div class='text'>I booked and paid, in full, for a small rental car through easyJet, including insurance. It came to £138
When I got Birmingham to collect it, I was asked if I wanted to upgrade to a bigger vehicle. Initially I said no, I don't want to spend anymore more money. She then cheerfully replied "oh don't worry, the upgrade is free". I just needed to pay a refundable £295 insurance deposit which would be returned when I bought the car back.
When I got to my destination I realised what I had signed was a entirely separate rental agreement and would not be getting any of my money back. I phoned customer services straight away but they just seemed irritated by me and got nowhere. Sent numerous emails to be told I should have checked what I was signing.
I was exhausted with travelling with small children and feel they deliberately deceived and lied to me to double charge me for the rental. Seems like a common tactic that they deploy. All in all cost £433 to hire a mediocre saloon for 3 days.</div>

                <div class='text'>We rented a car from Europcar at Gatwick Airport during the summer. Unfortunately, the vehicle we had booked and paid for was unavailable, and we were provided with a substitute. This was the first indication that things were not going smoothly.

Despite having paid in advance for insurance, we were informed there was an additional hidden fee for coverage, which was an unexpected and unwelcome cost. We had budgeted for the trip assuming everything was prepaid, so this extra charge forced us to adjust our finances.

While returning the car, an object was thrown from the vehicle in front of us on the motorway, striking the windscreen and causing a chip. At the rental depot, we informed the agent of the incident, providing details of the time and location, and offered to file a police report to address the situation. The agent dismissed our offer, advising that there was no need for a report, as nothing would be done about the chip. Trusting their advice, we proceeded to catch our flight home.

Months later, we were surprised to receive a charge for the windscreen damage, as there was no third party to claim from. Had we followed through with the police report, as we initially offered, this situation might have been avoided.

In summary, we strongly recommend caution when renting from Europcar UK. From hidden fees to aggressive upselling tactics, it seems they are more focused on extracting additional charges after the rental is complete. Our experience left us disappointed and frustrated.</div>

They are money greedy and will charge for anything and everything.

                <div class='text'>Awful. Upon delivery, they didn’t give me a full tank of fuel when it comes to collecting the vehicle the car had 20 miles less than when it was given to me but this is due to the fact that on the Friday, I had planned to go and put £10 in to take it up to what it had when they delivered the vehicle but they had then informed me the vehicle was uninsured. I wasn’t able to get hold of a Jerry Can I tried multiple times. Not much I can do the do expect risk being caught driving with no insurance. I explained this to the man and he said that’s fine. I will explain. I then wake up on the Saturday to find they had took A full tank of fuel out of my account and they wasn’t even concerned that they had cancelled the insurance basically saying to me that I should have drove the vehicle uninsured when at the top of my road there is an ANPR camera that would’ve flagged no insurance and they would’ve been quick enough to send the police to my door disgusting behaviour considering it was a courtesy car whilst my mums mobility car was off-road. They would’ve been happy for it to fall back on my shoulders driving uninsured meaning I could have potentially been put on a driving ban or worse time in jail. I will be lodging a formal complaint. This is just that everyone knows that you like to cancel insurances. By the looks of it it is an shocking company with really bad reviews so I’m not overly surprised to be honest with their behaviour, if I could avoid using them I would, but unfortunately mobility only work with them so in need of a replacement vehicle I am stuck with them</div>

                <div class='text'>Picked up my prepaid rental from Manchester Airport. Unbeknownst to me my prepayment of $395, booked through American Express, was not acknowledged by Europcar. At pickup I was immediately offered 2 different cars than my original reservation, my first question was “will these cost more”, the response was “no”. I signed paperwork whichI should have paid more attention to but was assured it was just a few initials to complete reservation and insurance details. After I dropped the vehicle off my American Express was charged an additional $926. American Express took the case but I have only received my $395 back. I was therefore charged an extra $531 for this rental: RENTER BEWARE OF SNAKE-OIL SALESMEN AT THIS LOCATION…..
FLEECED!!!!!
Europcar are refusing to refund any of the upgrade charges based on my claim that I was told there would not be an additional charge. Shame on me for taking their word for there not being an up charge and double shame on me for thinking that they would take my word that they said no additional charge.</div>

                <div class='text'>Picked up my prepaid rental from Manchester Airport. Unbeknownst to me my prepayment of $395, booked through American Express, was not acknowledged by Europcar. At pickup I was immediately offered 2 different cars than my original reservation, my first question was “will these cost more”, the response was “no”. I signed paperwork whichI should have paid more attention to but was assured it was just a few initials to complete reservation and insurance details. After I dropped the vehicle off my American Express was charged an additional $926. American Express took the case but I have only received my $395 back. I was therefore charged an extra $531 for this rental: RENTER BEWARE OF SNAKE-OIL SALESMEN AT THIS LOCATION…..

                <div class='text'>Europcar supplied a replacement car through my insurance company when mine was shifted from behind and written off. This happened on a Friday. The following Monday I had to drive from my home in Cornwall to Gloucestershire with my cat who was going to a specialist hospital for treatment, while I stayed nearby in a B&B.

Europcar Truro texted me on the Monday saying that my hire car would be delivered between 12 and 2. I had bee trying to call them all morning to bring it forward as I had to be in Gloucester by 5pm. They don’t answer this phones. They don’t even play music or have a message telling you that you are in aqueue….they just play you an advertisement over and over.

My insurance company did manage to contact them though, and Europcar called me shortly before 2pm. They told me that an MGHS has bee booked out to me and was on its way. This car never arrived. I then received another text saying that my car would be with me between 3 and 5. Shortly before 6pm the driver turned up with the smaller MGZS. I wasn’t able to fit all of my luggage plus cat crate into this so I had to leave some things behind.

Returning the hire car is proving to be similarly difficult., largely because EuRopcar never answer their phones. I tried to call them several times during the week to talk to the about the return, but they don’t answer. As I am typing my insurer is also attempting to contact them. The have promised to call the, back, but that was over an hour ago. If I can’t return the cat today I am going to have to pay for another night at the B&B and another night for the cat at the veterinary hospital. I have also tried to call the Bristol branch to see if I can drop the car off there but they don’t answer either, and after 20 minutes of listening to their advent they cut you off with a message that just says “ sorry there is no one here to answer you call”.

They treat human beings with contempt. I am disabled and things like this have a very negative effect on my physical health. I hope that NFU Mutual and other car insurers will stop using them. Had I known that they would cause me this many problems I would have hired a car from somewhere else at my own expense.</div>

                <div class='text'>I have had a very bad experience with Europcar.
I booked a Car via third party Called Economy bookings.
I received car rental voucher which clearly stated that the basic insurance was included.
When i attended the Manchester Airport Europcar branch I was told by them that there is no basic insurance included and i would have to buy one.
On speaking to Economy bookings they wanted to speak to Europcar Representative , who was very dismissive when he spoke to Economy bookings representative, not only clearly declined their input but he was affirmative that their is no insurance on the price i have already paid.
I had to pay extra to buy the insurance.
On my rental it stated as Selection protect as an extra when I eventually bought it than.
On returning the car, they found some sprinkles from a clothing,on the interior Suede of the car seats and they sent me a separate invoice to clean that, which I found really uncalled for.

So now i did pay extra for selection protect which was sold to me as basic insurance and also i have been sent another invoice for the carwash.
Price of £172.84 for a clean which was outrageous.

I have been back and forth both with Europcar and Economy bookings and had no joy in achieving anything.

Following your generic response to my review:
I have already a number of times flagged with customer service , the reason i came up on Trustpilot was dissatisfaction and disappointment to the overall service I received from Poor coordination on the desk to invoice generated for me.</div>

                <div class='text'>When we picked up the car we said we did not want any extra insurance etc - we did pay for an extra driver. I was asked to sign the form about additional extras, and noticed there was a charge on it of 3 pounds per day - I asked what that was, and was told it was VAT on the extra driver. I foolishly signed - only to see later it was for something I had not requested (emergency travel service - no idea what that is). The staff member had not printed his name on the form (as required) but did sign to say he had explained the extra product to me - he never mentioned it! I contacted Europcar by email the next day (phoning was not getting me anywhere) and informed them of this. They replied saying leave it until you return the car. At the car return they said we cannot help but contact head office again and you will get a refund. In the end they said I had signed and they could not check what was said, so the money was gone - even though I had contacted them the day after to inform them I did not want this (on a 7 day rental).
I have the impression Europcar UK staff are encouraged, or at least permitted, to mislead customers and charge extra - and they well get bonuses for this. Not trustworthy at all!

Europcar responded by suggesting that I give them "a chance to solve the issue" by contacting their customer service. This is their standard response and sounds good - except I have already exchanged several emails with their customer service dept - they started off offering to help, but in the end said they would not refund the money wrongly charged. I do not expect more correspondence will change that. It was not really a very good service for customers.</div>

                <div class='text'>I hired a car through easyjet at the cost of £244 and thus included premium insurance. When I went to pick car up from Glasgow Airport branch I was scammed from the minute I walked through the door. The young chap with a beard didn't even want to see my car hire voucher as he said he had it on his computer. Asked what car I drove normally I said an automatic as I have rhymathoid arthritis but for a week I would only need a manual which I had booked. Told me he would give me an automatic at no extra cost as I had a disability also said my daughter could be an additional driver in case I wasn't able to drive while I was visiting family. I did sign a form after he said it was a holding deposit which would all be returned after I dropped car off( they took £903 out my account). He folded up paper and put into envelope I made a point in say you haven't charged me any extra have you as my reading eyesight isn't good. Reply not at all madam. Enjoy your stay, dropped car off flowing Monday 14th Oct . Next day I found out they had taken out £653 out of my account for upgrade, young driver addition my daughter is 25. I have complained and told that because I signed it's my fault. They have scammed me out of this money by playing on my disability and poor reading eyesight. So I have just paid £900 for a hire car for a week which is absolutely terrifying. I could have got taxis everywhere cheaper than this. It is shocking what people are prepared to do to vulnerable people who are honest and hardworking. Glasgow branch seems to be good at doing this. I will never use or recommend them ever again. If I don't get my money back I will contact watchdog and the ombudsman. Playing on someone's disability is shocking. If I could I would give them zero stars</div>

                <div class='text'>Read the negative comments of other customers - it is all 100% true.
Their business standards - upselling, bundling, threatening, misleading on our example:
1. Refusal to release the vehicle in accordance with the reservation & voucher
2. Trying to sell a more expensive vehicle rental service
3. If you insist on what you ordered, they will start scaring you and add additional costs for insurance, location, service and something else...
4. If you refuse, you won't get a car, if you believe that there are no fees, they will add them to you later and you will be very disappointed

For your safety - avoid and run away !!!</div>

                <div class='text'>Hired car at Stansted. On arrival, was upselled a higher premium at no extra cost. Constant chatter by salesman with documents written under the counter assuring us that this is ALL free. No opportunity to peruse documents which were placed on counter with his hand on it, asking us to sign here and here. Quickly hustled out to car "to get us on our way" where we were told our car had been upgraded at no extra cost. Was told all money to be returned on return of car if undamaged. Upselling at its worse. Rapid conversation on tired people who have flown extensive hours, making connections with customers stating love to go to Australia I have family there, this is all free making him look such a great bloke, I'm going to upgrade your car, taking our original contract stating we/he don't need it. 2 attempts to take money from our account with no contact on why. DO NOT touch this company.</div>

                <div class='text'>We rented a car from Keddy Rent a Car which turned out to be Europcar through Car Jet. The original cost of the vehicle was £375 all in which I paid in full. On arrival at the Europcar office at Gatwick I was informed that I would have to pay a £552.16 refundable deposit before I could take the car. My partner handed over his credit card which the lady said it would be blocked on, we told her immediately it had been taken off the credit card but she said it never mind it will be refunded on return of the vehicle. 8 weeks later and still no refund. Going through our paperwork recently we only now have noticed that she didn't take a deposit but rather sold us the most expensive insurance without telling us. It's charged as Premium Protection. Possibly our fault for not noticing it at the time but after travelling for for 19 hours from Cape Town via Dubai to the UK, you are eager to get on the road, so that's the reason we didn't notice that we had been blatantly lied to.
We would still like this matter to be resolved and the lady in question to be charged instead as this is fraud.</div>

                <div class='text'>I originally booked the car through booking.com with their total protection package
On arrival at the office at BHX I was told the total protection package, wasn't with them and I would only have limited cover, they then told me I should ask for a refund from booking.com, and buy their insurance instead.
As I was only on a short stay in the UK, due to fly back to work, I took the agents advice, I had just come off my flight into the UK having been travelling for 12 hours and I didn't want any complications
My original car hire cost through booking.com came to £470.41 with the premium insurance
(Europcar then charged me a further £508 just for their insurance, which I hadn't realised until I got their invoice)
They then took a payment of £800 as a what was described as a security deposit, of which they have taken £708.41
I have contacted their customer service who have told me the £708.41 is the insurance package I signed for
Needless to say I'm not impressed in the slightest

Still waiting for any kind of security deposit to be refunded</div>

                <div class='text'>Absolutely terrible company! Avoid at all costs!

Booked with them thinking they were a reputable company as my wife was travelling alone with our 4 kids, so I wanted a no-hassle experience for them....well how wrong was I! Their agents at the airport counter were extremely rude, pushy and disingenuous with my wife, and she ended up paying £500 for comprehensive insurance which she didnt want, the car they gave us had a worse NCAP safety rating than the car advertised, which i understand to an extent they cant guarantee what car you get, but we made a simple request, she was staying nearby and the rental was for 26 days during low season, so presumably the advertised car would come back into availability during that period, could they give us a call so we could pop in and swap the cars, well it was as if I was asking them to sacrifice their only child, no one would give a straight answer, lots of ummming and arrring, lying to us about not knowing when cars would come back. Left the kiosk asking them to call us when they know more, not only did they not call us it took 3 days for their customer services team to even acknowledge our email, saying they couldnt look into our complaint until the rental period was over!! What a load of garbage... Seriously, save your money, or go to Hertz, Sixt or Avis....</div>

Needless to say I will never use Europcar again and will happily share what was easily the worst customer service experience and blatant scam I have ever experienced.
2nd update, exactly the same correspondence from Europcar batting off the problem with no resolution whatsoever. This has been the most diabolical customer service I have ever received by a long way. Word from the wise avoid Europcar or face getting blatantly ripped off.
**Update: I patiently wait for your response, you suggested I email customer services which I have twice so far with no reply, add that to the 40 emails I have sent to your customer services already trying to. sort out the excessive fees and poor customer service**
Absolutely appalling from start to finish. Terrible customer service with only a premium line to call costing me a large additional sum. Incorrect car provided with additional costs amounting to well over £400. I complained directly with diabolical correspondence from them in return and no resolution. I will never use them again and strongly advise the same. Only giving one star as negatives not possible.</div>

                <div class='text'>Please beware! Paid £1,400 for a £580 Europcar Rental: Misleading Deposits and Hidden Insurance Costs

I initially booked a 2-week rental for what seemed like a great price—£237 in total. The pick-up process went smoothly, and I was asked to pay a “deposit,” which I was told would be refunded if the car was returned intact. However, at no point did the staff mention any additional costs beyond what I had already paid online.

Fast forward to the end of the two weeks—I needed to extend my rental, but it wasn’t possible. No big deal; I returned the car and booked another one for £343. This time, I noticed that they had sneakily added a £30 per day insurance premium. To my shock, this same hidden charge had been applied to my first rental as well, even though it was never communicated to me.

Now, here’s the real kicker: the so-called “deposit” isn’t a deposit at all! They cleverly call it that to make you think you’ll get the full amount back, but in reality, they deduct the insurance charges from it. It’s a deliberate tactic to keep the insurance cost as hidden as possible until it’s too late.

When I asked if I could opt out of the insurance, they refused to give me a car and would not refund the £300+ I had already paid. In the end, what was meant to be a straightforward car rental turned into a financial nightmare. For four weeks of car rental, I spent £580 on the online booking, plus an outrageous £800+ on insurance, bringing the total to nearly £1,400.

It’s clear that Europcar’s strategy is to lure customers with attractive online rates, and then, after you’ve paid the non-refundable fee, hit you with surprise insurance charges—last minute—leaving you with no choice but to accept. If insurance is mandatory, why isn’t it included in the advertised price so that customers can make an informed decision? This is blatant false advertising.

Europcar has lost me as a customer forever, and I strongly advise anyone to steer clear of this company. In all fairness, the cars themselves are clean and good, but their deceptive, scheming practices make for a truly awful experience.</div>

                <div class='text'>I picked up my car from Gatwick airport. I explained to the counter staff my exact requirements particularly that I didn’t want an expensive insurance policy. The young lad was helpful but immediately went off and returned with two Mercedes keys and told me I could have them instead at a discount. I told him that I wanted the car I had ordered but with the basic insurance. In the end that car wasn’t available so I had a free upgrade. So far so good.
I repeated about my basic insurance requirements. He then went through the costs. I told him I didn’t want roadside assistance but he told me that was part of the package. I should have questioned him further on the package but he was nice and helpful so I signed the contract. Later when I read it closely I realised I had paid for premium insurance. I have now complained but have been told I have to wait until the hire has finished before I can complain. I now have the feeling the whole thing is a well rehearsed con to get the client to pay for higher insurance. Reassure the customer you have his best interests, focus on the free upgrade, gloss over questions on insurance and then stick him with premium cover. No doubt I will get no rebate later when I complain again.
Bottom line is to be very suspicious. If you suspect they are trying to cheat you they probably are.</div>

                <div class='text'>We booked and paid for our car before we got there . On arrival they said they didn’t have our car so would upgrade us for 20 pounds a day. We agreed to upgrading our insurance so that wasn’t a problem . They told us we were paying 480 pounds extra . It ended up being 1350 pounds extra so the price was almost $2000 pounds for 9 days which is ridiculous ! We took the car back 1 day early with no problems at all and have the invoice to prove it and they have taken another 1150 pounds out of my bank on the same day . I have emailed them lots of times and can’t get any help or refund . I cannot believe this has happened and am devastated as the amount is now 3000 pounds for 9 days hire !!!</div>

                <div class='text'>@GLA airport is a team of masters of ripping off additional costs. They do not recognize the terms and conditions of brokers selling their rental services.
We had a voucher from a junk broker (CARFLEXI - avoid them), we were refused a vehicle from a voucher (it's not about car brand but about category of the vehicle), we were told to pay extra for this vehicle and after the refusal, we were issued a vehicle of a lower category.
In addition, we were tricked into selling some absurd additional insurance, even though we refused twice.
When we picking up the car, the seller said it was a deposit, but after returning the vehicle it turned out to be insurance.

                <div class='text'>Avoid. Avoid. Avoid.

I hope that others read the reviews before booking with Europcar Gatwick. I have rented cars for over 45 years and have NEVER been scammed like this.

On arrival the woman at the desk tried to make me upgrade the car - making it appear that that was the one l been allocated (she already had the key on the desk infront of her). I refused and said l wanted the car l had booked.

Next, premium insurance was added to my contract without asking me. As a result, l paid 150% more on my originally booking price. I have annual excess insurance and never use the rental company insurance went l rent.

They hid the fact that insurance was added by including it in the credit card excess authisation. Therefore, you are unaware that you have purchased insurance until your card is charged after the rental. Look at the reviews, many others have been scammed in this way.

When I asked if the car had any damaged, l was told that it wasn't necessary to check it. On return, it was a different story, with the attendant checking the car minutely - going around it several times. In the end he found a very small scratch and l was required to sign off on the damage. I cannot say if the damage was already done when l rented the car. The scratch was so small l do not believe l would have noticed it ... and certainly not in poor light conditions.

If you use this company you should make sure that you photograph the whole car, including wheels, before you drive off.

Never again!</div>

                <div class='text'>I was mis-sold cover when I collected the car. The Europcar agent told me I had to pay non-optional additional funds to upgrade my vehicle to a larger one since they didn’t have the car I’d pre-booked in their fleet. After chasing this up with several customer service agents, I was told that I’d in fact been charged for additional insurance cover, and they refused to refund me for the cover that I neither wanted, nor used.
On top of that, the car I rented broke down. When I arranged for a mechanic to come check the car, they didn’t show up. I waited for over 5 hours for a mechanic to turn up, sitting outside of my hotel until 1am - only to have nobody show. Then they tried to charge me a call out fee.
After spending months begging multiple customer service agents for assistance, and after repeatedly being palmed off, I’ve now given up on getting my money back.
Beyond disappointed with the outcome, and a rubbish experience from start to finish.</div>

                <div class='text'>I want to share my experience of a “blatant scam” by Europcar to help prevent others from falling victim to such frauds.
I rented a car at London Gatwick Airport after booking the car and purchasing a "Premium" insurance policy online with e-Dreams. At the airport counter, the agent informed me that since I already had insurance with full coverage, I did not need to subscribe to any additional insurance. I was also told that a deposit of 700 euros would be charged (something I was already aware of through the contract signed with e-Dreams). In good faith, I signed the required forms on the tablet (the amount indicated was £647, which I believed to be the deposit) and was given a document with the rental and payment details; nothing else was handed to me, nor sent via email (certainly not an insurance policy that might have raised some suspicions).
After two months of waiting for the refund of what I thought was the deposit, I was informed, upon my inquiry, that no refund would be issued as the amount charged corresponded to the cost of the insurance I had supposedly subscribed to. Realizing I had signed a document without verifying that the amount (which was not specified) actually consisted of £100 for the deposit and £546 for the insurance policy (this was the final amount charged), I nonetheless filed a complaint with customer service. Their prompt response (only 21 minutes after my email!) stated that since it was impossible to verify what had been discussed verbally, only the signed document held any validity! It goes without saying that all the information regarding the costs and charges was written in such a small font that one would need not just a pair of glasses but a magnifying glass!</div>

                <div class='text'>This is the second time I have had an issue with Europcar in a month. After paying £150 via Autocar to rent a car from Malaga for 3 days, I was then charged a further 150 euros for the 'basic rental' fee by Europcar as well as 50 euro for an airport fee, another charge for the car being electric (even though I didn't book electric), they then said that insurance was 37 Euro a day but didn't mention tax on top and basically it has cost me at least £350 to rent a banged up crap car for 3.5 days which was insane. Completely scam.</div>

                <div class='text'>In brief, it is not a honest car hire company.

Update on 26Sept: after the communication, they admit nothing for sure, as we had signed the agreement. So, just prepare yourselves to pay extra if you want to have the hire.

Long story.

booked via rentalcars.com, another low rating company, an automatic was booked.

When I was at the counter, the staff told it was not under my name, and the car was not automatic, unless pay extra for it to amend it to be under my name and automatic.

rentalcars.com confirmed the booking was under my name and it was booked as automatic.

Also, it was funny that the counter staff told me not to trust rentalcars.com, and rentalcars.com CS told me not to trust any staff from rental companies.

The counter staff handed me a form of accepting extra insurance and additional drive (who helped me to pay and drove me there) or else no car would be given.

At that moment, I had no choice as I needed a car for my journey.</div>

                <div class='text'>Booked a car online to pickup from Belfast international airport and was quoted around £45 only for them to sneak in a ‘premium location surcharge’ when you sign the rental agreement which TRIPLED the price I was expecting to pay. Will not be using Europcar again, it’s totally misleading and this price should have been quoted online when I booked. Beware</div>

                <div class='text'>Awful experience!!!!
Booked my car hire well ahead of my holiday. My flight was delayed last night so I called europcar to explain I was unable to collect the car whilst at the airport waiting for my flight that was delayed by 3 hours as the Glasgow office would be closed on my arrival and I would have to collect Saturday morning. Agent said they would send an email to confirm my call. Glasgow Europcar had my flight number and phone number. I stayed in a hotel that was a 3 minute walk to Europcar and when I arrived at 9.30am I was told they had given it away the their 1st customer of the day as they put me down as a no show. Agent was rude not apologetic and told me I would need to pay £400 extra for a premium car!! When I explained that I called their call center he told me to call them again as there was nothing they could do as they had already cancelled my booking without Informing me. I called the call center for them to say as I could not collect at 10pm the car was released and a refund given, I was not told this when I called from the airport waiting for my delayed 3 hour flight. Left me at Glasgow airport with no form of transportation for me to get to Inverness. Worst customer service I have experienced in a long
time!! If you can't get to your booked car due to no fault of your own and you have taken to steps protect your booking by calling the call center be prepared for your car to be cancelled and not to be informed until you go and collect.
I will be putting in a formal complaint as I have not received my refund yet and I have had to find and extra £600 for a car from another company
No holiday treats for me or my family!!</div>

                <div class='text'>Absolutely terrible company. I would advise anyone to look elsewhere
I prepaid for a car online, and I was paying the full Insurance. But when I went to pick the car up they did a soft credit check and it failed! So what, I've paid in full, and the full insurance. So even if I was of the mind to steal it the insurance was paid!
This has left me without transport to pick my brother up from Bristol Airport, and it's to late to find an alternative.
This must be the worst experience I have had with any company.</div>

                <div class='text'>When I checked my credit card for my last rental in Heathrow, I found two unreported charges by Europcar:
1. a 193.36 GBP charge on, which should not be
2. The charge for the insurance for 8 days was 575.34 GBP when the car was returned after 7 days, and we were promised that it would be adjusted.
I send a reply to Europcar 4 weeks ago, they never answered . They do not care.</div>

                <div class='text'>Rented a car online. Picked it up at Edinburgh airport. The young man at the pick-up desk was polite. He offered full insurance, but I refused because I had insurance from the bank that issued my card. However, he insisted on buying Road Assistance Express. I agreed. It cost me 104,76 pounds( 9,17 per/day). Three hours later, on a very narrow road, we hit a rock with the left front wheel. The tire was punctured and flat. Of course, there was no spare wheel - a big hello to Mercedes-Benz with its B200! I called 0800 0280999, which was listed where I was looking for a spare wheel. It turned out this was impossible from my US phone! As it turned out later, the company's website listed a different number for non-UK phones - 0116 247 3228. However, this number was not listed in the agreement or anywhere in the car. This is simply outrageous! In the end, I got through. Explained the situation. It took almost a one hour(!) - endless waits on hold, interruptions, stupid offers to rate their work.... finally I was told that help was on its way. This was around 4:00 PM 17 September. NO ONE CAME OR EVEN CALLED before sunset at 7:20PM! I had to find a mobile tire repair shop and resolve the issues for 230 pounds. I am writing this the next day at noon. No one has called yet. This is a real EXPRESS service from EuropCar</div>

                <div class='text'>A few days after returning my rental car without any damages & full of petrol (agreement number: 156837779), I realised that they didn't refund the entire deposit of £752.38 that I left on the counter at the Edinburgh Airport.
So I reached out to the customer service asking why they didn't do it and there were still £68.22 pending to be refunded. After waiting 1 week they replied saying that there was a mistake and they charged me "1 additional day of hire plus licenses and fees due to an error", so they refunded £15.82 for the overcharge. At that moment I was still confused why they haven't refunded the rest of the money, so I had to follow-up 2 times with them because they were not saying anything about the rest £52.38 pending to be refunded.
Then finally they confirm that those 52 pounds are related to an upgraded added at the counter and that at the time of the pickup, there was added a "Roadside Assistance Express."

At this moment I also realize that the agent basically did this intentionally because I didn't buy the full coverage insurance at the counter. I told the agent that I had my own private insurance and he stated that the private insurances from booking.com don't cover glass and wheels. I told him that it was an insurance with my bank and that it has full coverage, so it seems like in that moment he decided to add the Roadside Assistance Express and didn't me anything that this was an upgrade and that I had to pay £52.38 extra for it.
If he would have done that, obviously I would have say no because I have full private coverage insurance already for this.

What did the agent do? He just told me to sign the Rental agreement in multiple corners of the paper on both sides and that's it. And then told me to put my credit card for the deposit. He also didn't mention the value of the total deposit and didn't say that he was charging me £700 for the non-insurance deposit and £52.38 for the Roadside Assistance Express. At that moment I would have also asked by there were 2 payments and I would have cancel it.

This is a very old school mislead sales tactic that should be claimed, but the customer service hasn't helped me further because I signed the agreement. The agent also signed the paper, but he didn't put his name, so I'm still waiting for a response from customer service to know the name of the agent who did this and file an official claim. What a terrible and disappointing experience.</div>

                <div class='text'>We clearly said we didn't want any additional insurance, which the guy at the counter confirmed and then prepared the papers/contract. It was super busy that day and we were rushed a bit, so we just signed the paper without reading it thorougly anymore, as we verbally agreed on the terms and already read through the terms etc. online when we did the booking (where we already booked some insurance which is why we didn't need an additional one).
Turns out they booked an additional 65£ in the end for an insurance we never wanted in first place.. thanks for nothing and not a nice way sneeking additional costs in like that.</div>

                <div class='text'>I hired a car from Europcar (Volvo XC60) on a recent trip to Nice. I booked the rental through a 3rd party comparison site and paid a deposit for the rental and was covered for some extras, such as environmental surcharge. On arrival at the rental centre we were in a queue for about an hour and when we got to the desk was greeted by a very pushy rep. The cost of the rental was not as per the original agreement and they had added on the additional environmental charge. The salesperson also tried to "upsell" me a Mercedes and additional insurance, which I declined, at which point his demeanor became more aggressive. I was also miss-sold a full tank of fuel on the understanding that I would only be charged for fuel I used. They also charged me over £400 for a tiny scratch on the bottom of the rear bumper which I must have missed on the initial inspection, however I do have insurance cover for this. Their business model is clearly to misrepresent the original displayed price and then aggressively sell or even miss-sell add-ons and I strongly suspect their staff are targeted and compensated based on these sales. I will never be renting from Europcar again and would urge others to think twice before using their services.</div>

                <div class='text'>I would not rate this company at all and give it 0 stars. I was hit by a tourist driving a hire car from Europcar last week. Their insurance company contacted me to offer repairs and a hire car from Europcar. I accepted and was given two confirmations of delivery of a hire car today. It didn’t appear! I phoned customer services who weren’t really much help. They told me I’d have to contact Edinburgh branch at Salamander Street to ask when I’d get the car. However they didn’t answer the phone and I was redirected to customer service again who weren’t able to tell me when or if I would get a car. So now I’m without transport and am having to spend valuable time and money chasing them up to no avail. I definitely would not pay this company for the hire of a car as they are clearly unreliable, promising cars they can’t or font deliver. Steer clear!!!</div>

                <div class='text'>1. I was charged for premium insurance as about 300 GBP even I asked not to… as I have my insurance…so was said at the desk the total price includes the deposit(not true), dishonest action of the guy at the Luton airport desk.

2. The car was not so clean even outside when I received it.

3. The tank wasn’t full when, only as about 80% of it when I received it, was asked for full tank when return

4. Tried to reach the Luton branch with no one answering at all for many times, even through your cs that tried to transfer me to them, not speaking when the battery died at the first day and the Europecar app direct me to the branch in any assistant, nobody answer…

Nobody at the cs answered my emails till now(2 months) and I confirmed that I sent to the right address.

I travel a lot but first time with Europcar ( and last).</div>

                <div class='text'>There were three europcar issues.
The first one was when they tripled their prices in the time I was waiting for them to call me back after they cancelled a booking- I complained about that but that's just what they do. They don't guarantee it wont change so isn't really anything we can do.

Those phone calls were also charging my phone bill without me knowing, but again, apparently that's in the small print somewhere so they wont do anything about that either- although I have sent an email. It incurred £18.47.

Lastly, the fine for the scratched alloy. Essentially, when I returned the car, I parked it in the drop off bay, then headed in assuming we would do the check out report with the europcar person as it was within drop off hours, but the queue was HUGE, literally out the door into the street. I had work, so didn't get a chance to check out the car. They then sent me the email saying they found a small scratch to the alloy, that isn't covered, even though I got the highest insurance cover I was eligible for. I emailed to say that I didn't damage the car and if they had enough staff then we would have done the check out together, but they basically said that's not their problem and I will still be charged for the damage- despite escalating it.

- I see their cutnpaste 'pretend to care' reply below. I have sent a message. I will update this review as it goes, but so far, full of rubbish!</div>

                <div class='text'>Worst experience hiring a car in 30 years.

1) Despite having a large empty airconditioned office, they made everyone including small children wait outside in the sweltering heat. Totally unnecessary (especially as every other rental car company was based in side the comfortable arrival terminal).

2) As you waited for your ticket to come up as, you could see 50% of staff chatting to each other vs serving customers adding significant waiting time [which obviously would not have happened if people were allowed to be inside]

2) Despite me saying clearly that I didn’t want excess insurance cover, I received a hard sell and was effectively threatened when I didn’t take and was asked for an additional €500 deposit.

3) Having paid for a car for four suitcases, the car boot was not close to large enough to fit (and they were soft squeezable suitcases) and I was made to pay more for a larger car (€25 per day)

4) On return, there were no spaces and I parked in the second row of Europcar spaces. I returned the key and was told “it was my job to move it” (by one of the four people standing around doing nothing)

5) The car on filling up had a diesel cap but two stickers said unleaded petrol. I therefore was not able to fill as didn’t want to take the risk</div>

                <div class='text'>Diabolical company!
We hired an suv with them in august 2024 in Majorca Spain and they gave us a “compact suv” which was apparently in the same “class” as a regular suv meaning our luggage didn’t fit and we were in huge discomfort with bags on our kids laps etc.
The queueing was horrendous and the customer service was dire, with no apology at all for our extensive wait with two small children in tow.
The car seats we had to pick up separately from a different location and one of them was broken, resulting in another trip to swap it for another.
They gave the hard sell on the ridiculously costly insurance which was not appreciated and they were unfriendly and unkind.
The return process was awful with lazy slow people not moving cars out the way/parking them so we were stuck in a queue for an age waiting for the morons to move.

                <div class='text'>I had the same experience. Got told by Europcar I needed different insurance despite already paying for one via 3rd party booking company. After being told I had to have it, later got charged for 2 different ones by Europcar that I didn’t agreed to. Stupidly didn’t read the terms on the contract I signed when I picked the car up at Europcar as I had the kids with me but also wasn’t looking out for it as I had already paid for everything up front. Wasn’t told to look at insurance details. Europcar then sent me an invoice that cost me an extra £144 at the end of the term and after disputing that with Europcar was told I had no case. I’d advise using another company, saying no to the add ons and checking everything on the contract.</div>

                <div class='text'>Insurance charge added and I was told it was a holding deposit.

When collecting the vehicle at the Europcar office, I was asked if I would like to purchase an upgrade to insurance, which I declined and stated I already had Car Hire Insurance.

I was asked to supply a credit card so they could hold a deposit and sign a
rental agreement. When reading the document I noticed additional costs and I questioned it. The customer service representative said not to worry as this was the amount I had already paid and the deposit amount (over £600). I was told that if any damage was found on the vehicle after it was returned or I had not refuelled the car the deposit would be used.

After returning the vehicle, my card was charged the additional amount. When I complained, I was told that this charge was for insurance and because I had signed the document, they refused to refund me for the insurance.

                <div class='text'>Please be very careful with this company, if you didn’t select the extra insurance then please don’t accept an upgrade. What should have been an upgrade of £5 per day for an automatic cost me more than an extra £500 for a 2 week rental. Blatant scamming their management couldn’t care less about.
One day we might find ourselves in an mis-sold PPI situation with car rental companies, karma!

                <div class='text'>I strongly urge people to insist on being given a copy of their car rental agreement upon collection. I wasn't given one and of course, a dispute arises, with 450 pounds deducted from my credit card I had to leave with them. This was 2 days after I had returned the car and was given a clear "Statement of Return". I had reinterated upon collection that I had no further need of any insurance but miraculously my signature appeared on their rental agreement.This was a very expensive lesson for me and I still think it is a very sneaky way to do business. I would not recommend this company(Gatwick Airport) and urge any future car rentals to be aware, photograph the car before leaving, and insist on a copy of the rental agreement. My Travel Agent and the Driveaway agent could not do anything to help me.</div>

                <div class='text'>We had 2 hire cars included in a holiday booking but when we arrived changed that to 1 larger car. The branch then offered us free full insurance for the larger car as a trade off.

When we returned we were then charged over 400 pound for the insurance we were told was free. When I queried this, I was told it was my word against the branch and therefore they couldn't refund it as I had signed. The document was all in Portuguese and therefore I wouldn't have been able to read it to understand. I was also then told there was no appeal process. Saves them the cost of a car for a week but changing to 1 even though we had paid initially for 2. Wasn't refunded the cost of the second car but instead conned out of a further 400 pound.

                <div class='text'>We rented a car from 5th to 19th August from Manchester Airport. Their online system was down so it was very delayed, all manually written, but I got the car. All fine with the car and since I dropped it off, they have charged Protection Premium (GBP 420). I specifically did not accept this online or at the desk. The form confirms this, and I even got separate 3rd party waiver for this purpose. There is no response from customer service and I will have to take it through the courts.

                <div class='text'>Having paid for every insurance excess available I was disappointed to be told that, after a minor collision, I was apparently not insured.

This was before anybody had inspected the vehicle or knew the circumstances of the accident (ie this is the normal starting position for them).

A replacement car was provided and when the driver arrived to collect the damaged vehicle and give us a replacement he had a payment machine and demanded that I immediately pay over £1000. I explained that I had insurance and he just kept repeating that I was not insured because I had a collision and it was my fault (without even asking about the circumstances of the collision).

I refused to pay. This saga continued at the airport and the threat of calling the police was raised by Europcar which I welcomed but this was a bluff on the part of the agent at Europcar.

Please also be aware that after you have paid for insurance online, when you arrive at your destination they ask you for more money (160 euros in my case) and tell you that you are not covered for an accident unless you buy this additional product. Cynical as I was, I did pay the additional amount and then was still told after a collision that despite having two policies (one for excess cover and one for any type of damage) neither were valid.

Nobody has contacted me since so I can only assume that this was pressure applied at the time to frighten customers. I worry that many people must have paid in similar conditions for them to continue to do this.

I you think this company is reputable given its size please consider this review before using them.

I hope that you find somewhere else and wish you all well.</div>

                <div class='text'>Went to collect car at LHR & decided to take excess insurance to reduce damage excess. Quoted 27pounds/day ended up paying 46pounds a day as they also added other insurance like personal effects breakdown etc. I verbally confirmed before signing hand held device as could not see any financial info. Customer service person confirmed 27 pounds a day & said contract would be emailed to me. After I returned to Australia contract was sent to me.

                <div class='text'>All seemed fine, we agreed on an additional cost of £40/day (£320+tax) for a car upgrade, but they ended up charging me more than £900 for extra stuff I never asked for.
Sure, I should have read the contract better, but the person at the counter ensured me that the extra was £40/day, but all of a sudden they charge for insurance, station charge, different fees, just because they had the chance to grab some extra bucks from someone in a very stressful situation.
They also scrolled through the contract and pointed to the signature field without giving me the option to read it beforehand.
I will never use Europcar again, they are a literal definition of a scam/fraudulent company. Never had an experience like this with their competitors Hertz and Sixt, go for them in stead, and stay FAR FAR FAAAR away from Europcar.

                <div class='text'>I am deeply upset by this recent hire. I am a regular user of Carflexi and have found their rates to be good. However, this time, I was allocated a pick up from Gatwick with Europcar. When we arrived we were rushed through the sign-up process and at no point were we given information or guidance on insurance. As I never get insurance cover (Carflexi can attest to this) I signed the papers and left. Only to find that I had been charged for premium insurance which cost more than the car hire itself. In addition, I was charged 40 pounds administration fee on a Dart crossing that I had already paid. I feel that these big companies act without any checks and balances and the customer becomes a victim.</div>

                <div class='text'>My partner and I hired a van to move house back in October 2023, and we’re unfortunately involved in a collision that was not our fault. The other party involved was arrested at the scene, and we have clear photographic evidence and witness statements of the incident. Despite this, Europcar have requested over £1600 in damages be paid by us. We were told by Europcar that if we had paid upfront, we would have received the money back once it had been settled through insurance. It is quite clear that they have no intention of settling this through insurance, as this would have been a straightforward claim and taken weeks to settle, and has now been ongoing for 10 months.

Neither Europcar or their legal representation have respond to our emails. In April, we managed to get a hold of the acting solicitors by phone, where their employee acted surprised and compassionate about what we had to tell her and asked us to send a full account of all evidence, comms with Europcar and witness statements. She assured us that she would be putting the account on hold whilst they investigated further and she would ensure we received responses to our emails (which we never did). It is now 4 months since then, and we have had no update on the outcome of their investigations or notice that the claim had been re-opened. They have now sent draft court letters out of the blue stating ‘multiple requests for payment’ - this seems unfair considering we were told everything was on pause.

Avoid this company at all costs. They are complete scammers and show no care or compassion towards their customers.</div>

                <div class='text'>We were provided a car via our dealership due to a fault on our own car. we have had ongoing issues with this car and therefore have a lot of recent experience with hire cars from other companies. our experience with Europcar was awful.
First, we were delivered a car without functioning aircon, it took multiple attempts to contact europcar to notify them of the issue. We were passed between the AA, tyre repairs and general customer service instead of being passed to the depot directly despite using the contact number on our reservation paperwork. Once we did get through, they asked us why we hadn't taken it to Halfords to be fixed as if this is something we should have known to do with a car that is not ours?! We should not be responsible for the maintenance on a car that is not ours!

when the car was dropped off, we had no paperwork detailing the level of fueling we had received but we made sure all 8 bars of the gauge were full before it was collected. we have been charged for refueling costs. we were also not warned when they would be collecting the car despite being told on the phone that we would receive a message letting us know they were on the way, we could easily have been out or in a meeting.

overall terrible customer service and communication, we would never hire with Europcar again out of choice.

edit to add: weeks after this hire we received notification that we were going to be charged the insurance excess because the car required cleaning. no way to discuss this over the phone. no idea how this company still operates.</div>

                <div class='text'>On arrival, we were told that the car we had reserved was not available and we would need to upgrade to get an equivalent. To be offered a car for €80 a day on top of the money we had already spent was insulting. The courier then proceeded to run through all the insurance options recommending another €480 to be spent which was more than the booking itself. Why is insurance not included in the hire cost? We were then told that the car had no scratches or dents on it. However, on inspection in the daylight the next day there were four significant scratches and marks on the car which I then had to phone to report, why had this not been picked up already? The whole experience has put me off hiring a car again in Europe again and I will be warning others of how poor the experience with Europcar was.</div>

                <div class='text'>Exceptionally poor service and system. Booking a car online does not guarantee you a car in Belfast. this needs confirmed by the station the next day. If the booking is refused because the car isn't available, they offer you a premium number to call, yes you have to pay for the privilege to being a customer. At the same time the system still sends you instructions to confirm your identity although you aren't getting a car.

The phone number for the branch, takes you to the main customer service, and again they do not know the availability of vehicles at the branch.

The company is extremely difficult to book with and contact, therefore I would avoid at all costs if you don't want to waste your time.</div>

                <div class='text'>Avoid at all costs!!
I paid extra to go with a reputable company like Europcar unfortunately they fell well below the mark, the customer service is appalling, I arrived 22 minutes to collect the car from Faro airport on the 25/7/24, I was told that was fine, I was then charged an entire EXTRA day for arriving 22 minutes early! I’ve spent over a week trying to get the refund, I’ve been told I would receive emails (which I haven’t). I was also pressurised to upgrade the insurance upon arrival so the whole experience has been really expensive. I would STRONGLY recommend to NOT use Europcar. I will be using Hertz next time. For top prices one would expect top customer service and after a 15 minuets phone call just now I feel no further forward with it. Not a happy customer!</div>

                <div class='text'>Booked a car online first time I had used Europcar and it will be the last .
Picked car up after the agent tried to sell me insurance which I knew I had done at the time of booking the car .
From picking the car up I didn’t stop till I reached my hotel and noticed a scratch on front arch .
Anyway on returning the car and now home , Europcar are harassing me about this scratch !! As an agent does not take the time to walk around the car pointing out damage other hire companies do . Plus when making my booking I paid an extra £30 for full protection insurance. Yet they are still harassing me .
I hire cars a lot from Bristol airport but that is one company I will not be using again and I would warn others to get the agent to walk around the car .OR JUST DONT USE THEM</div>

                <div class='text'>We arrived to pick up our prebooked care and were told it was going to be too small and that we would need a 7 seater vehicle which would cost us £250 per day. No other alternative was available. The agent offered us a 10 % discount on his quote. The car we received was in fact a 5 seater that I could have rented online from EUROPCAR for around £160 per day. In addition when I received my final invoice there was a charge of £433.06 for renting from a premium site at Heathrow. This is not mentioned anywhere on the rental agreement nor in the list of optional products I signed for. When I questioned EUROPCAR support regarding not receiving the product I was told I was getting and paying a premium for the incorrect car and a large charge not mentioned anywhere I was told that as they had a signed agreement they were not ready to reimburse any monies. Mohammed at EUROPCAR lied about the product we were getting talked up the rental and was not transparent about the charges. He then had the nerve to request we give him a good review presumably so he could get a good bonus. This is obviously Europcars business model and patently dishonest.

                <div class='text'>I made my 7-day reservation for Corsa through the third party website (Qeeq) at 149.93 GBP. On return I was charged by Europcar for the premium insurance which I bought at the Europcar desk at Stansted, and that's fine. It was 185.22 GBP. However, upon return, I also found out that Europcar didn't honour my Qeeq reservation at all but charged me for the rental of the vehicle as if I purchased it on the spot, as well as premium station surcharge, and licenses and fees, which amounted to extra 210.82 GBP. The person who served me at the Europcar at Stansted did not inform me about my reservation not being honoured at all. I found out later, when I called their customer service and they sent me the invoice. They also informed me they don't honour third party reservations as they don't include all fees. Scam.</div>

                <div class='text'>Case #20556287

I have been asked to email the same email address that have already provided poor customer service following the “addition” of a premium package at Glasgow Airport. They have basically asked me to go through the whole process of waiting at least 7 days for a response when all I would like is a refund.

A seriously frustrating company to deal with, thankfully never again.</div>

                <div class='text'>Hired from Heathrow.
Firstly, i booked through Economy Rentals and the value advertised only accounts for around 50% of the actual rental costs - apparently what was advertised only covered part of the compulsory insurance required - so there were hidden charges even though Economy Rentals state that there was none!
A 2023 model MG was hired, the car's air conditioning was not working, throughout the hire period, the weather was quite hot and this made the whole experience very uncomfortable and distressing. Live quite far from Heathrow so, returning it in between was not an option.

Also, the car's extremely loud alarm randomly went off after the ignition is switched off and car locked.

Overall, a displeasing experience.

                <div class='text'>Despite declining premium insurance at the counter, it appears the thieves working at Faro Airport added it and charged me anyway. On return, I have had 2 card payments taken, neither of which match the invoice provided. Be very careful using Europcar and their appalling staff at the counter. I have taken further action and disputed the transaction on my card.

Edit: After reporting their fraudulent activity, the response is they can't get involved. It's actually laughable. Simply, do not use Europcar</div>

                <div class='text'>Hired a car at Bristol airport. The service rep asked if we wanted extra insurance which I declined as we already had it independently. He then asked if we wanted Roadside Assistance cover and said it was "only £5". Both my husband and I commented and questioned the amount, but he confirmed that yes it was just £5 so we agreed. Stupidly I signed the agreement without checking it, assuming it was just for the car hire (which I had pre-paid) and the extra £5. It wasn't until I got the final invoice after returning the car that I saw that the roadside assistance was not £5, but was in fact £5.81 PER DAY plus VAT, making a total of £48.97. This was an added cost of 32%. I raised the matter with Europcar, but they were not interested in what the sales assistant told us, only what I had signed for. I consider this to be sharp practice, taking advantage of people who have had an early start, travelled a long distance and are anxious to get their car and go. This car hire was only for a week. Later in the year we will be hiring a car for a month, but it won't be with Europcar or any of their other companies, so for £48.97 they've lost out on a future hire of around £1300 and more on future hires.</div>

                <div class='text'>Absolutely scammed by the Europcar team at Edinburgh Airport. Turned up with a rental voucher fully paid including required insurance. Was told I had to pay an additional £114 before car could be released as my 3rd party booking site had not carried insurance forward. Was told this was a system fault and would definitely be refunded, and this was the only way to get the car, Following return of car with zero damage, Europcar now claiming additional insurance was “entirely voluntary” and will not be refunded.</div>

                <div class='text'>We have been charged with additional insurance we didnt ordered, and my personal data(email and phone) in the agreement were filled with false data. I can see simillar cases happened to others lately so I warn you.
Details:
We had 2 identical reservations. On the airport when taking the cars one of their workers tried to scam us on additional insurance for one reservation, but we didn't approve this cost and we were finally charged only with 100 GBP deposit per car as it supposed to be.
After coming back to Poland the deposits disappeared from the card, but day after charges fro 100, 100 and 290 GBP have appeared. For one reservation there was no invoice sent to the e mail. It took over a week for the customer service to sent It even tough I have sent them my agreement as attachmenet. It occured there is additional insurance for one reservation we didn't ordered.
I explained the situation from the airport, placed a complaint on that worker and demanded explenaition, but they haven't responded. Even though I have sent 3 reminder e mails regarding no response there was still silence.

I decided to open new case on customer service and after couple od days thay finally replied that the costs are valid. They have attached their version of the rental agreement. It occured that in "Personal data" there was some number to Switzerland (I am polish) and some dummy e-mail adres written in different handwriting then mine amd which I dont have on my copy of the document. That's why I haven't received an invoice on time I was still in UK. What's more there was additional page of agreement with "additional optional products" I haven't received from the worker and don't recall signing it. The customerservicesuk...europcar.com worker ignors my questions and demands for explanation, often being silent for days, only to reply that the charges are valid, ignoring the rest of the correspondence.

Hiring a vehicle through directline insurance and motability.... absolutely zero communication with any local branch and absolutely no resolution to a request to change a vehicle due to a medical need.

                <div class='text'>Absolutely appalling service from Europcar. Will NEVER rent from them again. I was travelling to Italy as I am part of Andrea Bocelli's management team and he was performing a series of concerts featuring other big names in Tuscany - I needed a reliable car to navigate this very rural area. On arrival the initial car they tried to give me (which wasn't what I'd booked) had a busted wing mirror so I had to trek back from the car park to the terminal with two large suitcases to get a different car. Within 3 hours the car had a puncture to the front passenger tire. I'm stranded in the middle of a very rural area of Tuscany in the pitch black and there is no spare tire in the car, just a lovely empty space in the boot where it should be. Some kindly locals allowed me to leave the car on their land until the morning but it was an extremely dangerous situation to be in as a woman alone. The following morning I made various attempts to contact Europcar by phone and email, to little avail. Despite having taken out their premium coverage package no one seemed to care. I am still (7 days later) waiting for the callback they said would be 20 mins. My Italian colleague also made various attempts - apparently not even speaking the language gets you anywhere. At one point I was told a tow truck would come and take it (offering no replacement) but I needed to call him back with the full details of exactly where the car was located. On trying to call back I got a message saying the number was out of service. In the end I had to arrange for a local mechanic to tow it back to their garage and replace the tire. They said the tire d was already quite bald and Europcar should not have sent that car out as it was. It cost 300 euro to get it fixed which Europcar have seemingly no interest in reimbursing. When returning the car I told them the busted tire was in the boot, a member of staff inspected the car then told me my holding deposit would be taken because the puncture constituted damage to the car, despite the fact that tires are obviously subject to wear and tear, the mechanic had stated in his report it was unfit for purpose AND I HAD REPLACED IT AT MY OWN EXPENSE. Disgusting service.

Updated following Europcar’s below reply: I have already emailed customer service to no avail days ago. I have also been in the phone with customer service at 11.12am today who said this would all be logged and I would receive an email with next steps directly after the all. It’s over two hours later - no email. Seriously…</div>

                <div class='text'>Booked and paid £135 for a car for 4 days for a family trip to Alton Towers so other than the drive there and back the car was in a car park for 3 of the days.
Collected the car with no issues, paid a deposit of £273 which I was told would be refunded on return of the vehicle.
No issues on the trip, filled the car with fuel and returned the car with no issues. Return receipt states - no new damage, fuel full and deposit would be returned 7-10 days.
After 6 days £100 was returned, when I questioned this I was advised £173 was taken for premium protection. When I complained I received a rude email from Adii saying I had agreed to this.
When I stated that I had not I was told it would not be returned and he refused to escalate my complaint, case closed.

I thought going with Europcar I would avoid nightmares like this. I am now going to struggle to buy my kids new school clothes. Disgusted with Europcar.

Europcar please don’t respond with the usual “please contact us to discuss” to make yourself look better because I tried that and got ZERO response.</div>

                <div class='text'>Post updated at end of this following the Europcar response below:

After a 3 hour delay to our flight into London Stansted last night we were told our pre booked and pre paid for car class was no longer available. We were offered a smaller class car at the original cost or a larger premium car at extra cost which is a lesser service than I have received at other car rental companies, but not the cause of this low review. To justify our car not being available, the staff member presented a rule about booking only being held for 1 hour, which we cannot locate in the T&Cs from our booking agent or Europcar’s own. Note for anyone with a booking already, in reading some FAQ pages there is the recommendation to add flight number (which we had not as we had not trawled through all the FAQs). So recommend anyone reading this to make sure flight details are submitted. But surely this should be front and centre in booking process and also the T&Cs?

However our experience continued to worsen as on leaving the yard we saw the type of car we booked being given to people after us in the queue by the same member of staff who had just served us. They had also had flight delays and had been told their booked car (again a larger one) was not available despite their being several others in the yard. They were also offered an upgrade to a premium car. Numerous other people in the queue (we were waiting 45mins) also seemed to have issues.

So it appears as though Europcar Stansted are giving people the run around claiming car are rebooked but are just chasing upgrade fees.

The smaller vehicle does not fit our family and luggage so we have to make further arrangements. It is a sour experience on arrival in the UK for a holiday.

We have contacted Europcar through their website and will update this post when a response is provided.

                <div class='text'>Just liars!
Omitting the fact that they will push you to upgrade to a more expensive car, they will also promise that part of the total amount will be returned as a refundable deposit at the end of your rental. Which of course will not. Read your agreement carefully and try to ignore what they are telling about better car, better insurance, etc..</div>

                <div class='text'>DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY
I was supposed to get a courtesy car from them through insurance. It took them two days to deliver and then the guy forgot the key. They told me if I wasn’t in at THEIR chosen time, they’d take the car back; which they did. Contacted head office who spoke to Stockport office and they denied it. Collection was supposed to be on 5th July and they turned up on July 16th. Customer service is a joke. No one wants to help and they hang up on you. They upgraded the car and expect to claim for same. Absolute joke of a company! DO NOT USE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES
And as you can see below! The same generic message. They’re impossible to deal with! The car has FINALLY gone back so the message is actually not even relevant to my review! What a joke of a company!!!!</div>

                <div class='text'>I recently had a very disappointing experience with Europcar and feel compelled to share my story to warn others.

On 6 July, I rented a Tesla Model 3 from Europcar at Heathrow Airport for a week. I prepaid £394.04, which included the Basic Protection Plan. Upon arrival, I was in a rush to pick up my family and trusted the Europcar employee, Danielle, who assured me that the only extra charge would be a refundable £510 deposit. I explicitly stated that I did not want any additional insurance.

To my surprise, when the invoice arrived, I was charged for:

Super Personal Accident Protection: £56
Selection Protection Package: £210
Roadside Assistance: £77.03

These charges were never discussed or agreed upon. The total amount on the invoice, including unexpected fees like a Premium Station Surcharge and various licenses, did not match the initial quote.

This isn't the first time I've encountered such issues with Europcar. Last year, a similar situation occurred, and despite raising a ticket, I received an unhelpful response, forcing me to accept the unjust charges.

This repeated experience of hidden costs and lack of transparency is unacceptable. I feel deceived and let down by Europcar’s practices. I urge potential customers to be extremely cautious and thoroughly review every detail before signing anything.

Overall, my trust in Europcar has been severely undermined, and I won't be using their services again</div>

                <div class='text'>Extremely slow service. I waited a total of 1 and a half hours, first in queue to sign papers and then wait for a car that wasn’t ready. Was being cleaned. I could have taken the bus and been in my destination much faster. They also charged twice what I paid for the car in insurance and took a £250 deposit. Poor service and will never use Europcar again.</div>

                <div class='text'>The worst experience I've ever had. I had ordered a car and insurance through booking.com. When I came to pick up the car, the man behind the desk told me that the insurance was inappropriate and that he would offer me insurance for only 30 Euros that would cover everything. I accepted it and signed it, but I noticed at the hotel that 30 euros is for one day plus VAT plus additional surcharges, which was 180 euros at the end. I am disgusted by this company approche and I advise everyone to avoid it from miles away.</div>

                <div class='text'>Rented a car for pickup at Ancona airport, Italy, for £250 for 9 days. All went well until I dropped the car off - no damage - and got an additional invoice for nearly £300.

Thinking it was an error - and that maybe I had another £50 to pay (local taxes, currency etc.) I waited for the final bill. It was the full bill for 9 days' insurance.

Interestingly, I was presented with this bill AFTER I dropped the car off. I might have had quite a conversation at the start of the car hire had they presented it to me then.

I see that other contributors on this site have had the same experience. I also note the corporate boilerplate in reply - please get in touch with our advisors to resolve the issue etc. etc. etc.

I have waited for my reply for Europcar before posting and they say that the charge holds. So don't believe the boilerplate - these people are rip-off artists.

Their agent in Italy is called Keddy. I suggest that anyone planning to hire a car abroad avoids Europcar and Keddy like the plague.

***
I see that they have added some boilerplate, pretending to care. Clearly, they don't read the actual content of their negative reviews or they would see that I have done all that already. Their answer was: "tough, local problem, nothing to do with us".</div>

                <div class='text'>Paid for 3day hire in Birmingham. With full insurance.Bad thing happened and had to postpone the trip 1day so i called europcar to let them know i would pick up day later but for the previously agreed time. They refused to keep the car (that was supposed to be mine for 3days and paid for) and said i need to rebook and pay again! What thieves they are. Disgrace of the company. Sometimes life falls apart,we find ourselves in a hard moment and need just common sense in people and a bit of help. Forget it with Europcar, they will steal from you if they find opportunity.</div>

                <div class='text'>Wouldn't give this company even 1 star. Or recommend for anyone to work there. NOT A GOOD COMPANY.
Managenent I worked with turned out to be UNTRUSTWORTHY & DISHONEST. Worked there for nearly 11 years & the supervisor, (or manager as she calls herself). BREECHED MY DATA, CONFIDENCE & TRUST in July 2019, which caused harm to my family, I & damage to my property. Didn't realise she was friends with a fraudlent roofer, (I had unfortunately given a job to, to have my full roof done). Higher manager, who should treat all staff equally, is a close friend of the Supervisor, so wasn't really interested in my complaint. I could not stand working with the supervisor.
I now work for insurance where breeches are taken very seriously & staff are constantly screened for honesty - people in the new company I work for, have no hesitation in whistle blowing - couldn't put the correct date in so took the oldest date....Iin response to your reply, EC - pass it to HR which is what should have been a choice given to me & not a comment 'I know her & she's not like that, I can speak to her if you want' - with what happened... I will never forget the manager's words or the supervisor's attitude.</div>

                <div class='text'>Absolute scam. Rented as I have done for many years through broker company and showed up to the Europa car (Victoria) and zero insurance included - had to pay premium or pay for full market value for the car if any damage (!!) and tons of extra charges. I was running late due to delays my side- tried to ring to shift the time slot but no pick up - … and then charged more for ‘an upgrade’ as they cancelled my original booking. So what was originally a £178 rental turned out to be well over £400!! The car was scratched and dented and they tried to claim two of the scratches were on my watch, despite them being listed on my copy (yet not theirs)….! Thankfully the manager remembered seeing these … avoid avoid avoid… guy who charged me tried to make it seem he was doing me a ‘favour’. Booked through Holiday Autos which I’ve used many times but both they and Europacar total Fail! All I can say is check and double check you’re covered. This was the most expensive car rental I’ve ever had. Never again.</div>

                <div class='text'>Originally reserved a rental car for Palma Airport with Premium Insurance paid for. Collected the car at the airport and paid for and signed paperwork for what I thought was a deposit for any damage or fuel, but now I found out I was miss informed into taking our Premium Insurance, something I already had. At no point did the Europcar employee explain this to me, only that it was the deposit. Why oh why would I take out further cover. This is not treating their customers fairly</div>

                <div class='text'>Booked and paid £135 for a car for 4 days for a family trip to Alton Towers so other than the drive there and back the car was in a car park for 3 of the days.
Collected the car with no issues, paid a deposit of £273 which I was told would be refunded on return of the vehicle.
No issues on the trip, filled the car with fuel and returned the car with no issues. Return receipt states - no new damage, fuel full and deposit would be returned 7-10 days.
After 6 days £100 was returned, when I questioned this I was advised £173 was taken for premium protection. When I complained I received a rude email from Adii saying I had agreed to this.
When I stated that I had not I was told it would not be returned and he refused to escalate my complaint, case closed.

I thought going with Europcar I would avoid nightmares like this. I am now going to struggle to buy my kids new school clothes. Disgusted with Europcar.

I wrote to them again following their comment below but to date 3/7/24 have had no response, they clearly comment just to look like they are attempting to rectify the issue when they actually aren’t.</div>

                <div class='text'>Don't not use this company!!!!

Whatever you do... There was 5 couples/groups there all having problems. They didn't let us collect our cars because of not having a credit card in the driver's name. This was the same for all the couples. Then we all called head office and got a horrible response. The Head office started staying that they we would have to cancel the booking, not get refunds, then we missed our slot from being on the phone with them and they was going give our car away so another person.

Then someone in the car company helped us. But we would have been stuck and out off £100s of pounds. The instructions for booking are not clear enough.. couples where having to pay £250 to get their car will full insurance... What a way to make money!!! They are scamming people to get the extra money. It's was a joking seeing more and more people come in a better charged an extra £250 because they didnt have the right booking details or information....

As we had another rental car company not honour our reservation due to car shortage, we had to walk into Eurocar. Totally took advantage of our vulnerability as a tourist and I'll never rent from them again. Double the normal charge and forced upon us a premium insurance package. Went through customer service who said too bad. $700cad/480£ for less than 24hr rental is robbery.</div>

                <div class='text'>I rented a car from Europcar at Gatwick south terminal for a week from 5th June and when I dropped it back I was told by the man checking it in all was in order. No damage was seen as none existed and it was refuelled. I proceeded to the airport with my elderly mum. Today a week later I received a letter by email from Europcar from their insurance department telling me that there was left side left mirror cap/housing scratch >5-15 cm and that I am liable for an excess. I have a speech impediment so I had my husband ring them to discuss because of my poor speech I didn’t pass their data checks and needless to say they can’t discuss with him. GDPR
They told me to send an email because my speech is poor. I feel I have been targeted here as a soft touch. There was no damage and this is all a lie. I can do without this stress.
I advise you don’t ever consider a rental from this company. It was my first and last rental. This is a scam I am faced with. I sent an email and I await a reply.
This rental company isn’t worth the hassle and will cost me a lot if they succeed in telling me I damaged a car which I didn’t.

Ps following the reply below I have emailed many times and all I am told by three different replies there is there was damage on the car on return and I have been sent a ‘statement of return’ dated correctly but with a forgery signature on it. It states I ageee to damage on a side mirror. Doesn’t this really make you so annoyed. Where is the justice here. I have asked repeatedly for the name of the staff member but that person remains anonymous. They are hiding behind a company with a large customer services department but they are BAD. A photo attached but because this was not pointed out at the time of return I have no way to confirm this was or was not present. This is evil. I am 56 and I have been renting cars for 36 years and never have I had an experience as this. It’s pure fraud and this needs to be called out for what it is and Europcar need to look into this and their employees involved here. There are two who accepted back the car and one of those is the man at the rental desk the day I hired the car.
Who needs this hassel. Now a bill by email today for €274. Believe me they have picked the wrong person to annoy and I will not be parting with any of my money to settle this fraudulent bill. I am an honest person and if there was damage on the car and it was pointed out to me on return then I would be the first to pay up. In fact I have an insurance for the excess but this is wrong on all accounts and I will not be settling. How dare they treat their customers like this. Shame on them and shame on all Europcar for allowing this to happen despite my emails.
If I lived near Gatwick airport I would go to the europcar office there and find the members of staff involved. I would insist on looking at the damage on the car to measure if this scratch exists and if it is over 5cm even though this is now 5 weeks today after the car was returned.

                <div class='text'>I went on a comparison site and found the ideal car for our family trip to Greece.

The first inconvenience is that when we arrived at the Europcar in Greece, they wanted more money. Take into mind that the car was only £106 for the week but now because we didn't have a credit card they wanted an extra 180 euros for insurance and 290 euros for the debit card details and deposit. The staff were very rude and our kids were getting very uncomfortable. The car was very scratched when we got it and so my husband took photos just in case. The site said that the car could fit in our suitcases which it could not but lucky enough having 3 small children we managed to squeeze the other suitcases on the foot well. We drove the car to the hotel. In the whole week we drove the car once for around 30 minutes. It was parked in the hotels car park. When we got back to the car depot one of the workers went straight out to the car and straight to the windscreen, apparently we had scratched the windscreen. I explained that we used it for a total of an hour in the whole week of having the vehicle and that there were scratches all over the car when we received it. The man sarcastically said maybe you upset someone at the hotel. Then he said maybe a cat scratched it. These accusations were absolutely ridiculous and he started getting very rude which was making my kids very distraught. I will not be using Europcar again, the whole experience has me thinking how many other customers they've fleeced and upset!</div>

                <div class='text'>Do not trust this company they use coersion, lies, and fraud tactics to get contracts signed at the desk.
In my case for insurance of £519, when I had already pre-booked and paid £51 for the premium insurance with AXA. Charged at end of rental, it was supposed to have been a returnable deposit, on return of the car.
That's the contract I signed.
Watch out for the pressure selling, then sifting paperwork about then asking you to just sign the bottom of contracts when you cannot see the contents as they kept loads of other paper covering the page I signed.
Complaints made but they are protected by there governing bodies that just protect there criminal activities.

Do not use this company you are in grave danger of being a victim fraud for hundreds of pounds like me.</div>

                <div class='text'>I rented a car from nice for 2 days & purchased their FULL INSURANCE at the desk upon getting the keys.

The staff member told me that I do not need to take photos of the car as I had the full insurance that covers all costs. They also didn’t provide me with any documentation of current damage on the car.

On returning the car, the staff pointed out a stone chip approx 1.5mm and said it’s fine & I wouldn’t be charged anything extra as I have the insurance.

A day or so later I receive my final invoice which had a €90 DAMAGE ADMIN CHARGE

Naturally I assumed this was an error so I phoned up to sort it out. However I have been told that admin costs are not included in their insurance & it’s in their terms and conditions.

So I have to pay the £90 on top of my rental & full insurance.

I feel this is extremely sneaky of them and disgusting customer service. Trying to squeeze everything they can from you out of deception.

Safe to say I will be avoiding them
At all costs.</div>

                <div class='text'>I returned a car to Europcar with a new tire I had paid for. Europcar told me I had waived its insurance, so wouldn't reimburse me. The next day it charged $465 for insurance. Utter fraud. The rental cost me barely more. Europcar ignores emails. Walmart is the company I paid for the rental, and refuses to contact Europcar because I didn't buy the insurance through Walmart. The credit card company won't challenge even though I didn't authorize the charge for insurance, but I did put a credit card down for damage. Europcar will keep doing this because it suffers no consequences.</div>

                <div class='text'>I got ripped off by these guys. I prepaid and when I went to collect my car I was offered extra insurance and a bigger car. I told them I wanted neither as I was going to a funeral and had 3rd party zero excess insurance. When signing the contract I asked what the extra amount was and they said it was the hold on my card. I returned the car with no damage and a full tank of petrol. But today I get the invoice and they have charged me more than double what I prepaid. I now have to engage with their non-existent dispute process. I have been renting cars for 30 years and have never paid for 'extras' and am raging that Eurocar would try these underhand tactics.

Update: Their customer services team have reverted saying ‘tough luck’ basically. I have asked for any cctv of the interaction as I know I am in the right here. This is criminal and I will take this further.</div>

                <div class='text'>Conned into buying additional insurance at the Stansted Airport rental desk on the premise that not buying it would invalidate the Full Protection package I had already purchased when making the booking... Customer Services adamant that since I had signed up for it the contract stood. I was under time pressure to get to see my ill mother, so was unable to take the time to argue the point. Legally probably right but appalling customer service.
UPDATE: I received an early reply from Europcar UK inviting me to provide full details via a link. I took the time and effort to fully describe the circumstances as requested. I subsequently received an email from the same customer service rep who had dealt with original complaint, repeating in parrot fashion the same line previously taken - no further attempt at resolution was made. I'm now even more determined never to use Europcar again!</div>

                <div class='text'>I recently used Europcar Gatwick Terminal South to pick up a car ordered from Australia on line. The desk customer rep seemed nice and friendly and we left with our car happy with the efficiency of it all. To my horror about Week plus after we had returned the car I found a debit to my account for an extra £239.27 for premium insurance protection and road side assist. Now yes I did sign the contract without checking the agreement because I trusted the desk representative when he said there were no extra payments to be made and I believed I had already paid in full on line. I suspect this is fraudulent practice and a deliberate up selling technique to gain commissions. BEWARE. I have had no help from Europcar to resolve this error.
P.S their reply here to help is dishonest. Their official answer already is you signed the contract. No acknowledgment of fraudulent dishonest behavior by one of their franchisee.</div>

                <div class='text'>The staff at Europcar Oxford office were particularly aggressive selling their Premium Insurance Package, not just with me but also with all the customers before and after me on that day. The staff told me my travel insurance would definitely not cover the excess. I then rang and checked with my travel insurance company, who confirmed the excess was indeed totally covered by my policy. In spite of my emphatic declining of their insurance, the staff deliberately left it on the contract which they hurried me to sign as they were busy and I had already taken up time. If there is any problem with the contract or the car, it is then intentionally very difficult to contact Europcar during the rental period. After the rental period, Europcar customer service had the attitude they were not present to hear on the day, so end of investigation. I would advise NOT renting from Europcar Oxford. Rent with a reputable company.</div>

                <div class='text'>Turn up and the car I reserved and had paid for was not available. In fact, none in its class were. But, guess what? A more expensive one was! How convenient ;)
OR, I could have a massive estate car to drive through the mountains of Italy, so my choices were somewhat limited and I had already queued for an hour to collect my car. Then came the hard sell for insurance and other add-ons that I clearly did not need. Then came the bill, with additional charges I had not agreed to such as an 'environmental contribution' and two 'customer choices' charges which I had to ask several times to be explained.</div>

                <div class='text'>Under no circumstances accept the offer of an upgrade. As nice as the front desk people seem, "It will only cost..." is not the truth. I made it clear I did not want to pay an uplift charge just for changing one thing on my booking. I wasn't planning on changing my booking but Mike at the Europcar on Northern Perimeter Road offered me an upgrade car which I turned down. My wife said she would like to be added as an additional driver and I was given the offer of full cover insurance or an automatic for the same cost as adding my wife at GBP 20 a day. I chose the automatic and added my wife as an additional driver. I was surprised to find that rather than GBP 24 a day, the an addition GBP 60 was added. Do not sign anything until you have checked the paperwork they give you. There is no mention of an uplift charge, 19%, just the item and the total. Zero mention is made at the desk that there will be an exorbitant charge just because you make a change at the desk. I wrote to customer service and all that was done was to point out there is an up lift charge that is in the documentation. I challenge anyone to find it, especially when getting off a flight and tired. It should be made clear by the desk staff that there will be an additional charge above and beyond the cost of item added, for the privilege of accepting the offer of the desk staff.

This is underhand. It should be made clear verbally and the uplift charge pointed out in the documentation. Most people like myself would not accept it.

To add my wife as an additional driver is valid, to disguise it by offering an automatic or additional insurance cover with no extra cost as I was adding my wife and then charging an uplift charge for changing to an automatic is deceptive.

I wrote to customer service and I received a brief response that essentially said read the paperwork and the 19% uplift charge would not be removed.

I have been a Europcar customer for nearly 30 years. This is the last time I will book with Europcar.

Another word of warning. There is no paperwork to sign and note any damages or marks when picking up the car. I took photographs before driving off and asked for the paperwork at the gate before leaving. The response I got was unclear so I drove back into the Europcar premises and asked at reception. They said upload the photographs. I could not find anywhere to upload the photographs. Beware, after logging on to the website there is a paragraph that says the noted damages are printed on the documentation you receive. It is not obvious. Take time to take photographs and compare to the documentation you are given. In my case not all damages, scratches were noted and the description leaves the extent open to dispute. Ask the reception to come out to the car, note all the damages and scratches and ask for the paperwork to be updated and sign the new documentation.

Do not take anything at face value. Europcar will hide behind not telling you of the uplift costs and leave it open for dispute on any previous damages before picking up the car.

Very disappointed by the business practices. Be very careful and ask for a full breakdown of any cost above and beyond what you think you have agreed to, it is not clear.</div>

                <div class='text'>Really not happy. I was told on delivery of my courtesy car that I would need to ensure that the car had a full tank of petrol, when it was due for collection. No problem I thought. As the car was delivered with a full tank of petrol and I'd barely used half a tank, I had no reason to visit a petrol station before the day of collection.
So on the day, I went to my local petrol station,but try as I may, the filler cap flap would not open. I was there for ages, but to no avail.
I reported the fault and when the car was collected the operative from Europcar, punched and punched the filler cap flap, until after 5 minutes it opened. He then informed me that I would be charged the premium rate for not having filled the car up with petrol.
Why? I had tried to fill up the car! Customer services at Europcar just kept quoting that it was their policy, and wouldn't budge.
I'm so upset, as I really can't afford this.</div>

                <div class='text'>I was deceived by Europcar UK, and instead of paying £366, I ended up being charged £642! I never imagined being scammed like this in the UK.

The story is that I reserved a car for £366 with basic insurance. However, when I arrived at their office at Stansted Airport, they suggested I upgrade to premium insurance for just an additional £4 per day, which would total £28 for 7 days. I agreed and signed the contract. After paying the original amount plus 28 pounds, they also mentioned they needed to reserve £400 for own risk, which I accepted.

Upon returning to the Netherlands, I received a bill for £642. When I checked, it turned out that the insurance was actually £28 per day, not £4. Although the bill I signed indeed stated £28 per day, I initially trusted their verbal claim and, being tired after my travel, did not double-check before signing.

This experience has been extremely frustrating. Please be cautious and carefully check everything if you choose to use Europcar. They were deceitful in my case, so ensure you verify all details before signing anything.</div>

                <div class='text'>Europcar fraudulently gets money by extortion, deceit and lies. Extra £529 scammed on debit card, was supposed to be the deposit.
Europcar refuse to refund as I signed contract which I was told was to pay the deposit for the car.
How many other customers have extortion complaints about Europcar? This clearly needs to be investigated for the protection of the car hire public.
The car hire, that I paid for through Argus car hire for two weeks was at £ 295, plus premium damage access cover at £51 total £ 346.71p to ET Car Hire on the 1st February 2024.
The car was a group A car Fiat 500 or similar.
When I arrived at Stansted I had to wait almost an hour, and I showed my Argus car hire digital booking. I was told that I can have a free upgrade, i said i was happy with the car i had booked but was promised it would not be at any extra cost i.e totally free upgrade! So Ok, other customers were also being offered upgrades as well!!!
Insurance premium was offered for cover very hard selling, I said I had already covered this with AXA.
I was told to pay for the deposit for the car (which I knew I had to pay) & that this would be refunded on the cars return. I was covered for all damages by my excess cover by AXA insurance paid through Argus car rentals.
Extortion, deceit & fraud can be expected when booking a car through these criminals, though they get you to sign the contract stating "signature is just for the holding deposit on car. Company are proud of their desk clerks who are "instructed to Sell there products" any way any means to get revenues .</div>

                <div class='text'>We used Europcar to hire a vehicle for the weekend in Italy from their Milan Bergamo Airport Branch. Booking the rental was easy enough, paid in advance for what I thought was a very fair price… When we arrived to collect the car, we were waiting a little while as the branch was clearly a bit understaffed and there were only two gentleman dealing with a high volume of customers, but when we got to the front of the queue we were told we’d had a complimentary upgrade from a Fiat 500 to a Peugeot 2008, which of course we were very pleased about! After reading that I would have to leave a deposit, I was asked to make a payment in Euro and thought no more of it, took the keys, was asked to sign a invoice in Italian and then given a copy. We used the car for four days, had absolutely no issues with it, returned the vehicle and had the invoice through to say the vehicle was returned in the same condition it was collected in and there would be no further charges. To my surprise, the day after we returned the vehicle, my credit card was charged with an additional fee of £178. I rang Europcar customer services, they told me I had ‘purchased’ a Premium Protection Package (which cost significantly more than the total amount I had paid for the booking) and when I told them I had not purchased any additional products and I’d like fee refunded they told me they would have to pass it on to their investigations team and someone would contact me within 48 hours! 5 days later, having chased them up again yesterday, I was fobbed off and told to send an email. I am now £178 down and there seems to be no urgency to help get this resolved. At best this is mis selling an insurance product, at worst it’s theft! Shocking service after what was initially a very good experience!</div>

                <div class='text'>Absolute joke of a company. Booked a large premium SUV for pickup (Volvo XC60 or similar).

Arrived at the branch, and was laughed at, and told that they don’t have this car available and have never had one. Didn’t have anything similar in stock.

Informed the rep that I required a large SUV and their response was “is an A class Mercedes okay?”

After which, I was offered an economy MG. Asked whether this would constitute me paying less and was told no. Cancelled on the spot.

Disgraceful customer service, and straight up lies. Avoid like the plague. Enterprise are so much better and that’s saying something!

                <div class='text'>We were lied to about the fuel situation a) that it would be a lot cheaper to leave it empty and pay Europcar to fill it up (even without the admin fee it would have been more expensive), and b) that we had to get it filled up within a 10km radius of the airport and provide proof of this on drop off. When we did this (a massive hassle) then dropped the car off, the Europcar staff member who we spoke to laughed and said this was absolute nonsense.

The car is advertised as "Ford Focus or similar", but there was clearly zero chance we would have ever got an actual Focus or anything other than a ropey old Kia (we checked the carpark on collection and drop off, nothing but old Kias in the Europcar section, although SIXT had a lot of new looking Fords and Audis....). it would be ok if it was mostly Ford Focuses with a few Kias to cover when very busy, but clearly not the case so this is just false advertising.

Also, why is the extra insurance not offered online when people would have had time to review it in detail and see if it was worth the money? Instead of being pressured into it when in a rush to get the car and leave. everything else is offered online, why not this? Not only is it a dubious sales practise, it also extends the pickup time to painful levels.

I used to use Europcar a lot for work about 10 years ago, back then it was a trustworthy, quick and reliable service, clearly it has gone way downhill and I won't be using it again.</div>

                <div class='text'>Couldn't and wish I didn't have to give any stars in relation to this company.
Awful customer service. Booked a van, paid for it for a move. Only to receive am email stating that booking is cancelled 2 days prior due to "no stock". Tried to call customer services - phone put down 7 times and disconnected. Commented on Twitter and call handler who eventually rung us wanted all our personal bank details. Not given - so put the phone down on us!
Refund apparently takes 14 days - but quick to take your money for a booking that never was! Already have our money but we have zero van - had to book with another company pay a premium and then move earlier costing us a fortune due to this awful company. Avoid. Total scam company who really need to train its "Customer Service" advisors. We want our refund!!!!</div>

                <div class='text'>After arranging a car hire from Australia, covering exactly what i wanted ,car and indurance wise I had a staff of Europcar try convince me to upgrade the car and insurance. 3 times I had to say NO.
I unfortunately got overwhelmed by the staff member to increase the insurance, and wise advised of the daily cost. But was never told of the the taxes and 19% surcharge they added.
After being fed up I just signed the papers. Looking back I noticed that the rate and final cost did not match, hence the extra charges. I approached their office, emailed a formal customer complaint and emailed the branch manager. They basically washed their hands and refused to accept any of my points. WILL NEVER USE THEM AGAIN IN ANY COUNTRY.......</div>

                <div class='text'>DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY - SCAMMERS AND THIEVES THEY ARE!
I wish I’d read the reviews here before hiring from Europcar. I booked through Holiday Autos for a Fiat500 at £60 for one day from Glasgow Airport, paid in advance. Staff very friendly and didn’t hard sell but asked about extra insurance but I declined as I have a policy that covers this already. I was informed no further payments were required. When I brought the car back it was checked in, no damage and full fuel. There’s a petrol station right at the entry to the returns that I’d used so it was brimming!

The next day I receive an invoice for £112 which incorporates a “Premium Protection Package” that I did not agree too, a “Premium Station Charge” which I was told nothing about, “Licences and Fees” charge which again I have no knowledge of what this is and lastly, a charge for used fuel even though I brought the car back with full fuel which was verified by the check in guy.

What’s even more suspicious, they charged my credit card with an entirely different amount, which was even more!!! This makes a day small car hire £200 from Europcar!

I contacted customer services to say they have made an error and to please refund the money. They say:
“I can confirm that the charge has been applied in accordance with the Terms and Conditions and therefore a refund would not be due on this occasion.”

This is pure fraud and deception. I will be contacting my credit card company, the police and giving them not only my evidence but all of the very similar reviews here on Trust Pilot. These people should be shut down at once.

STEER CLEAR!!!</div>

                <div class='text'>Firstly, the amount that I had to pay when I got to the desk was TWICE what I was quoted on booking, as I "had" to have the basic insurance added - This should have been told to me at booking!
The car I was given was 4 years old and had 64000 miles on the clock. I had a warning light on throughout my two weeks and twice it told me to "call immediately" for help. I could not get through to the office, so just lived with it.
When I returned the car, I was accused of scratching the door until I showed the original pictures I took when I picked it up! No apology.

Update: 22/05
A typical response that I was expecting back- it's all my fault and apparently I was lying about the warning sign as its 'fine now'. No apology for being accused of scratching the car. A very curt, accusing reply from Europcar. Not that they care, but I will not be using them again.
Oh and a warning - apparently 4 year old cars with 63,000 miles are what they are giving these days and that's completely acceptable to them!</div>

                <div class='text'>Not really a "REVIEW" because try as I might, I've not actually been able to get my hands on a car! Any attempts to telephone them has resulted in my being told they will call me right back. Any attempts to mail their customer services have been failed as the computer says their system is down.
My Motability insurance company first arranged a courtesy car from this firm on Tuesday morning and I was assured it would be delivered late afternoon.
On Tuesday afternoon, I was assured that it would now be delivered on Wednesday morning.
On Wednesday morning I was assured that it would be later
On Wednesday later, I was assured It would arrive Thursday morning and the they would ring me an hour before delivery.
On Thursday morning I telephoned to be told I could pick a car up if I went the 17 miles to Maidstone - this being over the limit that my mobility trolley can make in a single journey. Or I could cab it - normally £50 or more from here!
Getting more and more frustrated, I rang my insurance company who told me that they would ring me asap.
That was an hour ago - I don't hold out much hope as I'm still waiting the ring back I was promised a 9.30 this morning.
Whatever the outcome of this, I would recommend that any disabled person don't ever consider using this farcical company. They are not in the least disability friendly</div>

                <div class='text'>I recently picked up a car from Europcar Oxford. I had pre-reserved the car with a guaranteed price including VAT. Reservation no. 1171278816. The staff informed me very forcefully that no travel insurance covered the Europcar excess, so I should pay extra for Europcar's own excess insurance. This did not seem correct to me. So I immediately rang my travel insurance company and was assured the large excess that Europcar had was in fact fully covered by my travel insurance policy. So I very clearly declined the Europcar's insurance for the excess. The car I had reserved was not available, so I was told I was upgraded to a larger car at no charge. So I signed the form and took the car. However, when I later looked at the paperwork, I had been charged GBP 405 more than the guaranteed price. I have tried repeatedly to contact Europcar Oxford, but they will not answer their phone. I contacted Europcar customer services UK by email, they gave me a case no. 19781003, but said they could not help as the car was not yet returned. I then rang Europcar UK and spoke to Chris, who tried to help, but said he could not access what charges had been made. He thought perhaps I had been mistakenly charged for the Europcar excess insurance that I had clearly declined. He tried to ring the Oxford office, as he said only they would be able to sort out the overcharge, but they would not answer their phone. He emailed the Oxford office and asked them to contact me, but they have not. So I have been charged an additional GBP 405 and cannot find out why or have it adjusted. I find it appalling that a large company like Europcar cannot be contactable to sort out problems. It is perhaps a warning to others that guaranteed price is not honoured at Europcar UK and the company seems determined to avoid any contact with customers who have any problems. I have found it so frustrating trying to contact someone at Europcar who can help. I cannot recommend renting a car from Europcar Oxford.</div>

                <div class='text'>I hired a car from Manchester Airport via Carjet, paid for in advance. I was asked if I wanted any additional services and I opted for the full tank service only and refused all other additional services. I signed the agreement not realising that the reception person had also added in Premium Protection costing £385 - something I would not order.

What is particularly galling is that the reception person has signed off the document that he fully explained to the customer the benefits of the added services - which is a total lie.

I feel tricked by the reception person and when I complained to Customer Services I just received the generic reply “you signed the agreement”. I’m a pensioner living on the basic government pension and feel I’ve been conned out of half a month’s income.

I will never use this scamming hire company ever again and I urge you all to do likewise.</div>

                <div class='text'>The story: i've rented a car on booking.com, pick up/drop off at Glasgow airport, and paid it totally online with full insurance. It was wonderfully cheap (5 days for 90GBP).

After the (successful) rental period, some days later I realized that i was charged an extra 173GBP, which was a surprise.

After some emails (booking.com responded fast, europcar usually with 4-5 days delay) i got the info, that i bought a premium insurance at the desk (at pick up), so they cannot help. The car had 2x insurances, according to their helpdesk: “with my verbal agreement and unable to comment further as I was not part of the verbal discussion”...

What?!

At pick up, the agent (who was kind by the way) confirmed, that it is paid and it has full insurance, and i said "yes, i know", because i have chosen the option "full insurance" at booking.com. This was the full conversation about the insurance.
He didn't offer any other one.
There was no "verbal agreement". It was a trap.
The paper, which i signed there, my copy contained one line on the 1st page (with very small font) about a premium insurance, but it seemed to be the paid one (for me). In fact, this was a new insurance, which was twice as expensive than the whole rental!

So my advice: read very carefully the paper at pick up, because they have put an extra, unwanted item in my case.

The guy in the parking lot was kind, but the communication after the rental process was not cooperative. They repeated the same answer (copy+paste), not responding my questions, slowly, and didn’t help the find the agent (or give direct contact) who could confirm the situation. I tried to call them (desk at Glasgow airport, with no success, waiting during the "please wait music" for a long time). The europcar UK was a wall, which I bounced back.

This case could ruin all the whole holiday. I have to focus strongly on the positive side of the trip, otherwise this ruins it fully. :(</div>

                <div class='text'>I tried to book online and it said the office was open after 6pm for extra charge. I also wanted to return it after hours and also said this was possible online. I then called up to discuss the booking and was told sorry close at 6pm if not there by 545pm then cant have a car. I had to book an extra day to allow but they did allow a small discount for this. I also booked a child seat and was told it was in the branch and would be fitted ready for me. I paid and then called the branch to confirm pick up time and was told they have no car seat. I asked for the refund of the seat i paid and was told it would be sorted. I called customer service and the rude person who didnt care at all said it was not there problem. I collected the car and had to wait around and they then tried to sell me the insurance I had prepaid again. Upon returning the car i still had no refund for the car seat and had to go to a shop and buy one as they could not supply it. I spoke to customer services again and they said as a goodwill they will refund me the car seat hire i did not even get. What a cheek charge me for something and then tell me they are refunding me their error as goodwill. This was my first and last time using this company.</div>

                <div class='text'>I have no confidence in this company. I booked a van for a bank holiday, paying a premium for out of hours service. I received the confirmation email and then a week later had a phone call to say the booking was not confirmed (even though I had the confirmed booking email), the site was closed on the bank holiday and I should change my booking.
So get this: I went with Enterprise who couldn’t have been more helpful, and then called Europcar to let them know I had sorted out the problem only to be told the booking had been confirmed and someone would be there on their site out of hours! They obviously saw my booking as too much trouble and just wanted to not provide any service that wasn’t easy.
Needless to say, having a complete lack in trust, I decided to stick with Enterprise. I will be watching carefully to see that my refund from Europcar is returned promptly and in full.</div>

                <div class='text'>Hired a Ford focus or similar from Dublin airport 2 weeks ago. Awful experience, the queue was ridiculous as they only had 2 people on the desk with another standing watching! Other desks seemed to be flying through their bookings. We overheard someone in the queue saying you can go to another desk so we did this as after 20 minutes no one had moved. At the actual car pick up desk there were 4 more staff but only 2 calling customers forward. Immediately the upselling started “did we want a BMW for an extra €50 a day” of course no we’d already paid what we could affordthis carried on with other makes and we kept asking for the car we had ordered. We were told they didn’t have any which was not true as we could see them. We were then told the extra insurance we had bought through the booking agency was not valid and we had to take out theirs for €210. I called the booking agency and they said this was not true and our insurance was valid and we didn’t need to get any more. Then we were told the car needed to go through the car wash and eventually 2.5 hours later we got a large Hyundai Kona (not a small compact car as ordered) we took it as could not bothered to argue any more. We today found out they charged us £75 for the tank of fuel which actually should be more like £55. Absolutely disgusting service, feel like scammers. Will never use again and will tell everyone else not to.</div>

                <div class='text'>I had been travelling since 5am,arrived tired at Stansted Airport Europcar desk having pre-booked a car. I expected a simple, straight forward hand over of a set of keys and motor away. However my agent sensed a mug. I mentioned I had purchased additional insurance via Ryanair so not to bother with the company insurance policy.
" Very sensible sir!",he said. "As a customer of a preferred carrier, I can offer you a heavily discounted rate on a premium car " He then produced two sets of keys from a filing cabinet and asked me to choose one. Next a scribble of numbers on a note pad,crossing out of prices and next " as you can see an excellent rate!" Then the soft sell insurance. " Of course the policy you have bought is fine except it can take upto 8 months to get your claim sorted and money back .You have to chase up payment...its taken off your credit card. It can be a lot of money.!" So now I'm not just tired from my journey, but getting stressed and worried too. For my own piece of mind I took their extra insurance...a form handed over sign here,initial here and insert your credit card here. Before realising it,my costs had doubled. My Smooth Talking Agent no doubt on a bonus for additional sales. No mention of the car I ordered which was half the price. The MG car was nothing particularly special either. I was taken in and vowed NEVER AGAIN will I hire from Europcar. Consider more a customer needs,not commission bonus for quick sales.
I called Europcar customer services shortly after my return to complain about the sales agent; I was informed it would be passed on to a manager and I would be contacted.....nothing happened,its now nearly 7 weeks,so hence my review .</div>

                <div class='text'>Can't really recommend this company. I rented a car in Italy (Lamezia) and had it collect it and bring it back during the night due to flight times. I followed their instructions to the letter on where to park and how, I took pictures of the car just after I parked it back on return and there was no damage.
The night after I got an email from them saying there was damage on a rim, a long scratch. From then on it became a nightmare to have myself listened by their customer care which is probably operated by hamsters, they are not comprehending basic language and cant handle email attachments. You can't basically reason with them and they wont listen.
They claim that despite the fact that I parked in their alloted space in the airport parking it's my responsibilty if any scratch is found on the car (for example another car may have caused it after you parked, it's still your problem).

Out of desperation I try to contact the italian cuscare to try to resolve the issue, they just ignored me like the UK one.
Now after 3 months I've got a bill pf 214£ for a rim scratch.
Luckily I have my own rental insurance and I can use it, but word of warning for you, don't use this company if you fly in the night.

A shame since the desk crew was nice and the car handled well.

edit:
the company asked me to contact them after this review after I already stated I did it twice. Totally helpless.</div>

                <div class='text'>If I could give no stars I would.
I booked and paid for car rental online. Europcar took full payment for the rental and 48 hours later emailed to say they had cancelled my reservation based on my credit score.
I had already paid.
They wouldn’t have released the car without a deposit and I was covered by insurance.
How exactly did they think my credit score was going to be important if everything was already covered.
How dare they take full payment ahead of their decision.
By taking payment they became contractually obligated to me and then breached the contract. They should not have taken payment until they were happy to enter into a contract with me. But perhaps they needed me to pay in order to be allowed to access my data.
Won’t ever use Europcar
I’ve gone with Hertz. Much better experience- better car and better value.</div>

                <div class='text'>As a disabled driver who has had their vehicle damaged by a food delivery motorcycle rider, and the driver door is not closing properly, a replacement vehicle is ov the utmost importance. I have now been waiting for 11 + days for the replacement vehicle and it was supposed to have already been delivered last week!? Well today at 4 pm was the last thing that direct line motor insurance had told me that a vehicle was being delivered, it’s now 5.47 pm and I have no replacement vehicle?? I now know what my vehicle is being picked up from my address on Monday morning so I am now without a vehicle. 👏👏👏👏👏👏 that’s why Europcar had such bad reviews 🤬🤬
To add insult to injury I have had a reply from Europcar with a link to give further details, so that they could help me!! And the link doesn’t seem to work!!!!</div>

                <div class='text'>Really disappointed in my experience. I arrived at the Europcar desk and submitted my rental booking information which was for the agreed amount of £59. This included unlimited mileage, collision Damage Waiver, Theft Protection, Third Party liability etc which was satisfactory to me.
The gentleman at the desk said that was all in order and asked if I might take a few minutes to register as I had never used Europcar before. I was in a rush but happy to do so.
I was never asked if I wanted premium protection. That it was put on my bill without my consent is completely unsatisfactory. I have never had that happen to me before. When I am asked at a car rental if I want additional insurance I always decline. I have never had the experience of it being put on my bill without being asked. Is that the Europcar policy? I have asked them to clarify that but they have not done so. It is very suspicious practice - although a quick google search shows it has happened to many others

I was told that since it was my first time using Europcar I was being given a free upgrade so i assumed that represented the difference in my paperwork
I was then given a form and told to sign where the x's were.
I do feel that I have been tricked into paying a higher fee. It's not just a few euros, my bill has trippled. I contacted customer complaints who more or less said it was my word against theirs and since I signed the paperwork the case is closed.
Would never use again and would not recommend anyone else does</div>

                <div class='text'>The experience with the company has been absolutely shocking and have no organisation skills at all. My insurance informed you Numerous times to have my car ready for the 9th April. You had no records and we had to chase do to get it delivered - when they finally got a car to me it was not a like for a ford it was a massive car I wouldn’t of been able to drive. I then had to wait another day for a car to come. The car was okay but a lot of scratches and dents in it a lot low pressure alerts in the wheels. I only had the it for one day and my car was ready again was absolute no point. I Inform you to get it collected and arranged for it to be done Monday the 15th and given a time for 10-12 midday pick up- no on came/ no one called me or even bothered to contact me at all. I wasted another day in the house which I booked for a holiday for this to be collected. The man who rang me the following day and the nerve to call me a liar on the phone so I had to end the call as I was furious. The car got collect the following day but was not signed by me when collected. I wasted 2 days of missed work for this and another day of holiday- that’s 3 days of money I have lost due to this company and being called a liar. The company lacks any accountability and has no structure at all. You all need training on time management</div>

                <div class='text'>Disgraceful company recommended by insurance company. Car was collected from my home at end of rental, we brimmed the tank (although it wasn't full on delivery). The following day I had a text from my bank to say that europcar tried to steal £55.08p from my account which they blocked. I called europcar to find out why they tried to steal the money to which the reply was for fuel. I pointed out it was collected full by their employee and he signed it off as perfect. I asked them to put me through to the chester branch where I spoke to a man called Simon who confirmed they collected the car full but it was then used as a pool car and the charge should not have been attempted. I tried the link they suggest to contact for complaints europcar.co.uk/ contact-us/email which after trying 5 times I gave up as it DOES NOT WORK..
I suggest everyone looks elsewhere when renting/hiring a vehicle as this lot have genuinely earned their pitiful rating here.</div>

They overcharged us for extra insurance, extra days, everything they could get from us by lying to us and doing all the cheap strategies of the worst selling men. Customer service was horrible, car was barely moving. Nothing positive to say.

Not to mention that I already contacted their customer service and the answer was sorry but we can’t do anything, and they even attached some documents the never showed to us as a “proof”</div>

                <div class='text'>Thanks to your Luton Airport crew for defrauding me out of £261.82 on your sign here scam. My company had booked the car and paid for insurance so all I had to do was pick up the car. I had to use my card for the deposit which was fine. At no time was I offered "extra" insurance and at no time did I agree to buy extra insurance. One week after returning the car, you charged my card for premium insurance! Apparently while initialling where the attendant had put the x's, I agreed to buy premium insurance despite already having insurance. This is fraud, you are thieves. Now being investigated by my bank AND the police. You know fraud is a criminal offence right?</div>

                <div class='text'>STAY AWAY!! This is my first review on anything, and here’s why: I hired a car from Europcar and got premium insurance. We checked the car, got videos & photos.

They claimed we damaged it when we absolutely didn’t. They then said it was fine as I had premium insurance.

This was 3 months ago. Today, I received a letter saying I have to pay nearly £300 for the damages I DIDN’T EVEN DO!

There’s a reason why you’re reading reviews, so please listen to this one. I’m warning everyone I know.

There’s a reason as to why there are so many ‘europcar scammed me’ facebook groups & forums.

If you don’t believe me, go look for yourself.</div>

                <div class='text'>Europes number 1 car hire. Number 1 as in absolutely terrible. Worst service ever. Booked a car and then arrived to pick it up, hard sell to buy add ons. Told the car wasn't covered under insurance for the first 1200 pounds even if any damage wasn't my fault, I'd have to pay. Pressured into pyaing to reduce the excess. Mistake made and doubled charged for the deposit. 500 pounds instead of 250. When I ring them about this, I'm told I'll recieve an email in 5 days logging my complaint. Ridiculous. Please do not book anything with this company. Can't believe company like this are still working nowadays.</div>

                <div class='text'>we had via ryanair booked and paid for a rental car including full cover insurance.
when we get to the Europcar office in Standsted airport, they don't have the car as agreed, we get a car with automatic transmission instead and agree on an extra price of 70 pounds.
When we get there we discover that the employee has written an additional price of 470 pounds including a new insurance.
Therefore, we write an email to customer service, who simply rejects everything and refers to the new contract and in no way looks at what we had booked and paid for</div>

                <div class='text'>If I could give zero stars I would. They did not have the vehicle we booked at Glasgow Airport or any in the same category so offered an upgrade free of extra charge. Fast forward to the day of return and they have invoiced me a huge sum of money for the upgrade plus a pile of expensive premiums and protection packages. Said their manager would be in contact by email as the sales reps don't have the remit to authorise refunds. No contact received and full amount taken from my debit card. What a total racket, complete deception and shameless upselling. Would never use again and urge everyone to avoid.</div>

                <div class='text'>It was the worst experience of my life of customer service. Picking up a car,
I went to the desk got told to go the other desk,
queued at desk after 10 mins got to your staff counter which
told me to check in via a stupid terminal next to the unit.
(Why don't you put the terminal where people queue or a sign
saying to login - or whatever the terminal is for).
So I put in the details and queued again.
15 mins later got to the front of the queue again and go told it wasn't
my turn and wait until called.
(again why don't you tell us that we need to wait until called).
So after 30 mins I got to the desk and spent 15 - 30 minutes arguing with your staff
telling them why I didn't need your super/super insurance for £15 a day
when my insurance document clearly stated not to accept your staffs hard sell insurance tactics.
So after being told I was stupid, which I replied you are and your trying to
steal my money, your staff get very upset and said they would not deal with me
unless I calmed down. This was all in Spanish to again confused the situation.

I expected to show all the documentation that I had printed off in advance
and to have a friendly chat and pickup my car in 10 mins.
But it must of took nearly 2 hours to eventually drive the car away.

So after my lovely welcome I was told to pickup the car from the car park which
took ages to wait to be processed again probably another 30mins and
when eventually got into the car I had to go back and show them
bits that were not on the list of existing marks on the car.

On return your staff again didn't wasn't to speak any English and basically rude.

So in conclusion your Ibiza staff need training and when people say they already have
super insurance don't try and sell super/super insurance.</div>

                <div class='text'>Terrible Experience at Europcar Luton

Rating: 1/5 stars

Review:
My experience with Europcar at the Luton location was nothing short of a nightmare. Firstly, I was charged for premium protection that I explicitly declined, and then hit with a premium location fee that was never mentioned during booking. The icing on the cake? A known scratch on the alloy was somehow blamed on me in the report. Despite reaching out to customer service via email, I've received no resolution or even acknowledgment of my concerns. Avoid this place at all costs unless you enjoy being overcharged and unfairly blamed for damages.</div>

                <div class='text'>As part of an insurance claim, was given a luxury Mercedes E-class Estate. However after about a week it was decided it was too expensive so Europcar took the Merc away and instead provided a Golf hatchback.

The Golf itself was fine however when it was provided to me it clearly stank of smoke underneath that awful stinkbomb they use to cover up smells. a day later the stinkbomb smell is gone but the smell of smoke is just as strong. The car itself had also not been properly cleaned. Clearly they rushed out the first available car to me with no care about cleaning the vehicle properly and dealing with the 2nd hand smoke that clings to the entire vehicle.

Would not be comfortable driving children in a Europcar.

No follow up has been made to my complaint.

I have attempted to follow the link provided but there is no option to speak to someone about this issue specifically or for customer service to get in touch with me. Furthermore when I do send in any communications it just says error try again.</div>

                <div class='text'>We rented through a 3rd party, so my wife phoned europ car to ensure we could use a debit card. They said it was fine.
When I arrived, they said you need to use a credit card or pay for the extra insurance. As I got the car for a month, it upped my bill by £300.

Then they charged me twice and it's a nightmare trying to get them to look into it.

If you read this, try anyone else, even dollar!!!!!

Update: I got in touch and they said they couldn't deal with me as my wife booked it, even though I was the main driver and the payments came from me. So they basically stole from me, but a civil case would be more than they stole. Abysmal company.</div>

                <div class='text'>I can’t chose no star because they don’t deserve any star. I had the worst experience with them. I have rented the car from rentalcars.com and I did pay for the car online. When the time for depozit refund was coming they stoped money for insurance and rent again and on top off that they stopped money for additional taxes. So instead off £95GBP for 2 days vehicle rent they charge me £276GBP.
If you want to be ripped off just rent a car from them!</div>

                <div class='text'>We returned the car in excellent conditions. We were stuck in severe traffic and we almost arrived late to the airport. With all the stress we forgot to pay the toll charge that is £2.5. Europcar is trying to charge us £40 to deal with the fine. The deal with the fine was literally forward to us the fine from the toll enterprise. I find this unbelievable considering the amount of job they had to do to forward me the fine. I would understand the need of paying this if it was affecting the car or the insurance but not just to forward a document. I will never ever use this rent a car business and recommend to anybody.</div>

                <div class='text'>Disgusting company! They scammed me into paying for expensive insurance by saying, and I quote directly, "It's only £19 and covers you for everything" but failed to mention it was a per day charge!! I had a 3 week rental and it ended up costing me £400, and now I can't pay my rent and will be homeless. Customer service refuse to refund me even though they wrongly took this money from me and scammed me into paying it. They also add hidden fees to the booking at the end.

                <div class='text'>I hired a car from Edinburgh airport recently with Europcar via Rentalcars. I took out extra insurance of around £45 and total bill was just over £200.
I was tired and had had a bad journey with my first flight so late I nearly missed my connection to Edinburgh, and I had to wait to be seen by the agent with europcar. I had all my paperwork, passport, driving licence, credit card. I was asked if I wanted an automatic car, but when I was told that it would be an extra £25 a day I said no. I was hiring for 9;days. When I went to sign the paperwork I noticed it said estimated cost £425 ! I asked about this and was assured that it was only an estimate. It was a case of sign here, here, here. I returned the car duly after the time. Only when I got my credit card bill 2 weeks later that I found that I had been charged an extra daily charge for insurance
, amounting to £264.24. I immediately phone europcar and they said as I had signed nothing they could do. They put the phone down on me saying they couldn’t hear me. Rentalcars refunded my insurance though.
I was never asked about this insurance as I already had it. It was added by the agent with no authority from me. I have written to complain several times with an unacceptable answer.
The agent called from Edinburgh airport and when I challenged him he said client services will sort it. I asked for his name and he put the phone down but n me!
I just want the £264.24 refunded as it was missold to me. Europcar can afford to do this. I cannot afford this extra charge which I never was asked about or consented to.
I will never use them again.</div>

                <div class='text'>Disgraceful customer service.
Insurance company used euro car Middlesbrough branch for the hire car, only text confirmed after I rang twice to chased up, if you expect to be contacted by the euro car , no chance.
Confirmed to have the car by 10am, rang them by 12pm asking how long more to wait for the hire car, got a bad attitude from the staffs telling all the reasons that I wouldn’t have the car by 6pm!! They need to pick up the car from Newcastle, the car needed service and brake pad change!!! How ridiculous that they do it on the day they knew they need to deliver the car by 10am!! Moreover, the attitude was so wrong as if its customer’s fault to have expected the car should be delivered by the booked time. Never been into this situation before, how speechless to the euro car’s customers services. Avoid euro car Middlesbrough!</div>

                <div class='text'>We booked and paid on line in Australia, when we arrived in Manchester we had been on a 25 hour flight without any sleep, so were exhausted. The collection should have been quick and easy, but we had to stand at the counter for at least 20 mins while we were encouraged to upgrade our car, get full insurance and to choose the ‘buy fuel option’ so we didn’t need to fill up on return. All while ‘checking with the manager’ to see if this is ok (?!!) We chose not to get an upgrade, bought the fuel and went with full insurance (as snow was predicted). When we got home three weeks later we had been charged for fuel and refuel cost. The main complaint is that ‘Joel’ knew we had just come off an extremely long flight and I feel he kept us at a the counter until we agreed to stuff so we could go!!</div>

                <div class='text'>DO NOT RENT from this company. The price may appear as the best, but buyer beware. They will pressure you to upgrade at the counter, so price invariably goes up. I returned a car with "minor" damage and could get no help in getting the claim settled through the insurance that had been included with the rental. They simply billed my credit card even though there was insurance in place, then said it was up to me to figure out how to claim it back from the insurance. How's that for great customer service! They take your money and then run, instead you take your money and run to the next available rental company.</div>

                <div class='text'>First time car hire renters at Bristol airport served by Ryan..... Upon arrival (we had prebooked with gotorentals incl insurance) we were strongly advised to take insurance with Europcar at a cost of £351(£100 paid back on return of car).. When we tried to show our insurance was already paid for Ryan disregarded our proof as 'nothing to do with europcar, leaving us confused and feeling we had no choice but to pay them... We feel totally ripped off by our first and last (with europcar) car hire experience.. For the record £100 was paid back to us upon return of car and Ryan was still at the desk and advised us to contact customer services if we were unhappy. I have emailed customer services twice with no response whatsoever.!!! A very expensive trip.. Would NEVER use Europcar again...</div>

                <div class='text'>Update: the car has been cloned and we not only have photo evidence, it was also issued a PCN 6 days after we gave the car back. Hopefully Europcar don’t take this further and deal with police, council directly. If they had not of paid the PCN and referred it to us we would have appealed the charge due to multiple difference's in cars.

We had a car hired via the insurance and gave it back the end of December. For some unknown reason today they have charged us 2 lots of £162.90. No reason for this and why are they holding on to your card details for so long. We filled it up at a garage 2 miles away from store so unless they are charging this for less then a liter of fuel I have no idea. No one will help us because we don’t have the reservation no. Do not trust them with your card details.</div>

                <div class='text'>Dreadful service from Europcar. Our insurance arranged a car to be delivered due to somebody crashing into our vehicle. It was arranged for a 9am drop off and yet only arrived at 6pm despite calls and confirmation that arriving 9am. They then tried to take bank details a 2nd time and deliver a 2nd car. Now due to be collected - telephoned to say they were coming between 5pm-6pm yesterday and were on the way so came home from work early for them to never arrive and never phone back to advise otherwise. Had email to say they would collect before 11am today and now its 11.30 and still not collected. Telephone and just get passed from pillar to post.</div>

                <div class='text'>My car was hit and the insurance company - Marshmallow, arranged for this rental car company - Europcar to provide me with a courtesy car. The driver delivered the courtesy car to my house but didn't ask for my signature, instead, he just inserted the keys into my front door mailbox and left. Ridiculously Europcar requested that I personally deliver the signed documents to their office (your employee did not ask me to sign the document in person, and now you are requesting me to personally deliver the document back to your office? Is this the proper way to treat a customer?).

Afterward my car is repaired, the garage delivered it back to my home without notice, and the staff of garage said he will drive the courtesy car back to their garage. Europcar will directly retrieve the courtesy car from their garage (I just immigrated to the UK, and I don't know if this is a normal practice, but the driver emphasize that it is normal in the UK, said no worries).

Two days later, I received an invoice from Europcar by email which is charging me for petrol fees. I can understand this, but when I returned home that day, I only discovered that the driver said he need to take the courtesy car away. At that time, I didn't think about returning the car with a full tank of petrol, and then I received a very unreasonable fuel charge.

I sent two emails to Europcar to express my dissatisfaction and explain the situation when I returned the courtesy car (I understand that I need to return the courtesy car with a full tank of petrol, but the problem is I had no idea the garage driver would suddenly ask to take it away). I requested that the fuel cost be charged based on the actual market price, but I did not receive any response. After that, I returned to my hometown for three weeks. I did not receive any email, phone call, or SMS reminder from Europcar during that period.

When I returned to the UK, I received a letter from Shakespeare Martineau which is pursuing the debt on behalf of Europcar, with a late payment charge of £40. From day one I have never received an original invoice from Europcar, only electronic ones, which do not mention any penalties for late payment.

I finally settled the invoice payment to Shakespeare Martineau before the deadline. At the same time, I emailed the payment receipt to Europcar and Shakespeare Martineau, emphasizing repeatedly that the £40 late payment charge is unreasonable. I won't bear this unreasonable charge.

Two weeks have passed and I just received an email from Shakespeare Martineau, saying that I haven't paid the outstanding debt. Today, I called Europcar to inquire about it, but the staff said they don’t know what’s happening and asked me to call another number for further information. And then I waited for 20 minutes, and in the end, they asked me to leave a message saying they would call me back.

I have been living in the UK for 2 years, and sincerely, many of my friends have had to contact insurance companies for claims due to traffic accidents. Many of them say that Marshmallow Insurance Company's handling of insurance claims is poor. I really didn't expect it to be this bad. I am the victim, my car got hit. The other party says it's a company car and asks me to claim compensation from their insurance company. I didn't expect that later on, Marshmallow, the law firm and Europcar would all constantly seek opportunities to charge fees from me or the other party. This is simply an all-in-one scam that insurance companies have taken advantage of government regulatory loopholes and expanded. Under the guise of claims insurance, actually providing various services under different pretexts and then charging exorbitant and unreasonable fees.

I will give Europcar a negative review and raise awareness to their opaque operations. In any situation, whenever individuals file a claim with their insurance company, it is always the citizens who end up being the victims while these businesses benefit.</div>

                <div class='text'>Absolutely terrible.
Car provided for me via the AA insurance.
I was assured it would be at least a 5 door within my like for like category, due to the fact I explained I have two small children, car seats and a pushchair.
I was provided with a 3 door Fiat 500 which I cannot even fit my pushchair in, and therefore unusable for my family.
I was told nothing could be done as it was within the same category as my own car being fixed.
I was told nothing of this nature would be available for another three weeks.
Why 5 doors or larger boots aren't reserved/prioritised for families seems like an extremely unhelpful policy.
So I am essentially car-less, with absolutely no help from Europcar due to the lack of prioritising their fleet.</div>

                <div class='text'>I've been hiring cars for many years and thought I was sharp enough by now to avoid extra costs. Not so when I recently hired a car from Europcar at Belfast City airport. The 'nice' lady gave me a free upgrade and didn't try to up sell me, was very pleased with the car and experience initially. Imagine my surprise when I received an invoice from them after I returned the car to discover I had been charged for 3 days premium insurance! Wasn't even mentioned when I collected the car, she just added it to my credit card. Of course this is all my fault for not thoroughly checking what I was signing for, she lulled me into thinking they were an honest company. Taught me a £92 (over twice the car price) lesson! I'm sure this is fraud. I complained but of course as I signed they said I must have agreed to the verbal agreement. Am recommending to everyone to avoid!</div>

                <div class='text'>Unfortunately I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to express my disappointment with my recent car rental experience at Faro Airport.Upon booking the car rental for six days, I was quoted a price of £84 pounds, which seemed reasonable and within my budget. However, upon arriving at your office at the airport, I was informed of additional charges that were not initially disclosed. These included insurance fees and road tax for motorways, amounting to an extra £128 on top of the initial price.This unexpected increase in charges came as a surprise and was quite disappointing. As a customer, I value transparency and clear communication when it comes to pricing and fees. It's disheartening to encounter hidden costs that significantly impact the overall expense of the rental.I want to emphasize the importance of transparent pricing and upfront disclosure of all fees associated with the rental. Customers should be fully informed of the total cost before making a decision to proceed with the booking. Such transparency not only fosters trust but also allows customers to make informed choices.Unfortunately, this experience has left me feeling dissatisfied, and I must say that I will not be considering your services for any future car rentals. I hope that you will take this feedback constructively and consider implementing measures to ensure transparent pricing practices in the future.Thank you for your attention to this matter</div>

                <div class='text'>After another car hire company let me down I walked into Manchester Airport Europcar and asked if I could hire a car on the spot. The young man went and spoke to his manager and then came back and said yes he had a car available.
This is where the misleading begins.
I asked for 3 days - Wednesday to Saturday morning - He put 5 days on the order
He mentioned a full tank of petrol from Europcar - I refused.
He mentioned NOTHING else. My other hire was 56 GBP for 3 days - He quoted me 515GBP for 3 days
He then said I was a privileged customer and he could discount that to 428 including a 100 GBP deposit.
All the while indicating this was the cost of the car hire for 3 days
It wasn't -
He'd added
2 extra days
Premium Protection 5 days - 173.49 GBP
Roadside Assistance 5 days - 65.47 GBP

Begrudgingly I agreed to the amount of 328 + 100 deposit thinking this was the price of a car last minute in the middle of a rail strike.
He then pointed to certain x parts on the form to sign - I duly signed NOT realising he had added these EXTRAS.
After getting in the car and driving home I double-checked the paperwork and was gobsmacked the actual hire cost for what I had ordered should be 45 GBP
He'd managed to slide in 239 GBP of extras (days and extras)

I immediately called the bookings line of Europcar and this is where they really DO NOT CARE - AT ALL
Call 1 - Put the phone down after my explanation
Call 2 - Took my details but no reference number - Also said he could amend a booking to be bigger but could NOT amend a booking once it was paid even if it was wrong
Call 3 - Customer services - he eventually made a case but had no details in it and kept me on hold for a very long time.
He would not give me any option to escalate
He only gave me the standard CS email
He also would not amend the booking even though we were 3 hours into the hire. He said he couldn't do anything once it was signed and paid for.
His comments were "You should have checked the booking before signing it" - Quite rudely

In that he's correct -

With Europcar I as an unsuspecting customer would expect to be misled - it seems an established practice to sell extras
I would expect they add details that you never discussed and never asked for
Do NOT sign anything until you've checked the dates, days, and extras plus the car.
Europcar is comfortably in my experience the worst hire company operating in the UK. I'd avoid them at any and all costs. It cost you an awful lot of money as I'm finding out.</div>

                <div class='text'>I would not recommend this company. I picked up the car in the dark so could not properly inspect it. The assistant advised me that since I had full premium insurance(as an additiona cost) it would not matter what was wrong with the car. Its just as well as the Car later turned out to be scuffed and had a chipped windscreen which was attributed to me. Had I not had this additional insurance it would have come out on my pocket. The moral of the story check the excess as the standard excess is 1600 pounds. As if that wasnt bad enough they added strange surchages to my bill for example a premium station surchage and other licence fees. These were not expected or explained. Now I am having to spend my time sorting this out with customer service. Not a great experience at Edingburgh Airport.</div>

The next day I got an email that the van I wanted was not available but I could ring them to sort something out. I rang the number given but they were unable to help me. However, they did charge me £5 for the call. There was no mention that the number they had given me was a premium rate number. If this is common practice they will be making a shed load of money whilst being totally unhelpful. Totally unacceptable in my opinion.</div>

                <div class='text'>I now live in Spain, and planning a visit to see family after Christmas in the UK, I visited various comparison sites for car hire. Using CarJet I booked a "compact" vehicle with KEDDY car hire & took out the CarJet 'zero excess' insurance cover with Avia to avoid the much more expensive one using Keddy.
The pick up was at South terminal Gatwick, at the EUROPCAR desk. ALL the paperwork was in the name of Europcar with no mention of Keddy at all.
I was given the agreement to sign, and my credit card was charged with 'a holding charge' at NO time was I offered any insurance regarding 'zero excess' OR informed that I had taken this out. Had this been the case I would have refused as I already had cover in place. On reaching my daughters about 3 hours later I thought that the 'holding charge' seemed an odd amount ( £383)? On looking at the agreement, it appeared that I had been charged for Europcars PREMIUM 'zero excess' insurance. I immediately (only 3 hours after picking the car up) rang customer services, explained the situation and asked for the Isurance charge to be removed. The agent said she would report my request to an investigating agent and they would be in touch. I recieved an email with a case number. The hire was for 10 days, and after 8 days the 'pending payment' dissapeared from my credit card statement. Case closed I thought, although I had recieved no more communication from 'customer services'. The day after returning home a 'pending payment' once again appeared on my credit card, this time for £325! Once again on to 'customer services' a prolonged phone call, and being told that the case had been closed,I asked the agent to open a new one, which he did. I will say that the two agents at Customer Services were both courtious and as far as it goes 'understanding'
I consider that the desk agent at Gatwick however, did dupe me into signing the agreement, which of course DID contain the insurance agreement. With my signiture on that agreement,of course it gives me no option of claiming a 'non authorized' payment with my credit card issuer.
When doing research into Europcar, I found out that they also own GOLDCAR car hire, which in Spain is notorious for similar bad service and underhand actions.</div>

                <div class='text'>And the saga goes on.. After being scammed by Europcar after my comment on trust pilot, they invited me to make contact with them which I yet again did, but as yet NO reply and to add to my misery with these thieves. They have Stolen another £70.49 from my account
So I paid £ 103 to CarJet to hire / insure/and out of hours drop off For less than 3 days hire, I was told at East Mids Europcar office that I could not be insured through a 3 rd party other than block £1800 from my card or get a taxi to my destination and then be without transport for my 3 days, I reluctantly paid £ 179 for what I was told was £79 for insurance and a returnable £100 deposit.. I returned the car undamaged with a full tank of petrol. Only to be charged £151? 3 days after leaving at the hire office.. I enquired as to WHY and was sent an invoice for 5 days insurance and an extra days hire 🤷‍♀️ I have queried this but as yet have had no reasonable explanation.. And to add insult to injury today ( nearly 7 weeks after the car was returned Europcar) they have taken a further £ 70.49 from my account with no explanation at all.. Be very very careful if you hire a car from these thieves.. Particularly at East Midlands.. They lie through there back teeth .. I really don’t know how they sleep at night!!

This is for Europcar who have put the usual BS about contacting them.
. Well EUROPCAR I have contacted you on several occasions and no reply.. Stop paying it lip service thinking you have appeased me.. You haven’t and I advise anyone who has had more money stolen from these thieves to contact ACTION FRAUD..</div>

                <div class='text'>Very disappointing experience, in December I used this service for car rental in Portugal. During the car pick-up, their manager offered to use premium insurance (which was triple the cost of the car rental price by the way!). I repeatedly declined the offer, and in response manager informed me that then I needed to pay a deposit which I agreed and paid. After the car was returned to my surprise deposit was not returned in full, I had no idea why is that. After contacting their support they informed me that I was charged for premium insurance and they refused to give any further explanation! According to them, everything went according to the process! This company deceives its customers on purpose and openly acknowledges that this is their standard process! Avoid them if you can!</div>

                <div class='text'>CHECK YOUR AGREEMENT.
Hired a car 23/12/23. Manager was great and helpful but working alone until his colleague turned up late.
I was then served by the colleague.
Premium protection was added onto my hire charge without my knowledge. I did not require premium protection.
It was not explained and was not taken from my card until i returned the car on Jan 3rd. Maybe i should have checked the paperwork but i was already running late for my drive to Scotland.
I cannot fault the company on the hire prices but i cannot help but think these extras are being added on in a dishonest way.
My advice to anybody hiring would be check your paperwork properly, even if you are behind on time.
Because the staff do not explain the policy adequately.</div>

                <div class='text'>Stay away from this company. I have been scammed by them and even disrespected.
I rented an automatic MB CLA 200 AMG LINE PREMIUM COUPE (PDAR) or similar (or similar) for 664.57£ for 9 days.
When i arrive at the desk, I ask the lady to confirm to me that the cars is fitted with all seasons tyres, just as i have been told over the phone by several agents of this company i spoke with, prior to my reservation.
She says yes of course, but if you are going to the highlands, i recommend you to take a 4X4 (a Mercedes GLB) and it does have winter tyres and forecast says we might get some snow.
Ok fair enough i say, security has no price right, but you are offering me a car that is 2200£ while i ordered a 664.57£ one.
I don't mind but i want to check the car tyres first.
I go and check the car tyres and not only they were all summer tyres, but on top of that they had 3 tyres from a different brand out of the 4. This is a NO GO even if the car has AWD and it's absolutely illegal in many countries all over the world (but not in the UK).
I came back and asked to be given another car and price difference refunded.
I had to go on the parking slot for 1 hour to find the only car that had M+S (mud and snow) stamp on the tyre side-wall (the rest was a disaster with plenty of cars with 3 different summer tires and none of them had all season tyres).
I said i want that one. It was an MG EHS Hybrid.
Please refund me the price difference.
After pushing me to take all sort of insurance i told her i only want the bare minimum, i don't need all that crap.
In the end she charged me 1,387.50£ which was still more than 2 times the price that i was supposed to pay for almost the same car. MG EHS is a budget family SUV car that is worth 37,000€ in Belgium when bought new. In no way it can cost the double of a Mercedes CLA 200 AMG Line to be rented that costs 50,000eur.
This is a clear SCAM.
Of course i couldn't check what the correct price would have been within their parameters by making a simulation online in their website but i knew i was definitely for sure getting scammed and i had no other choice than pay and go away.
When i left the desk, after a few meters i see behind my shoulders the lady laughing with his colleague talking about me and laughing loudly, almost having a laughter.
I have travelled all over the world, dealt with many renting companies like sixt, avis, europcar. But the very despicable way i was treated by this europcar agency is simply out of this world.
SHAMEFUL! I will continue my social bashing of this company, until someone will contact me.They do not deserve to be operational. Scamming and disrespecting like this their customer.</div>

                <div class='text'>Stay well away from Europcar in Luton. I stupidly didn't check the car because the agent told me because I took the insurance cover out It wouldn’t matter if the car was brought back in half I was fully covered. When I brought the car back I was blamed on doing all the damage and it was quite a lot! now Iv lost my £100 deposit.</div>

                <div class='text'>This company deceives customers by tricking them into options they do not request or need. I asked for the cheapest possible vehicle for a short rental and requested no insurance coverage (I have my own). Instead I was charged for a premium insurance package and optional extras like navigation system that I was not told about, did not request and was given no option to decline. This is basically theft.</div>

                <div class='text'>A very unethical compnay that will try to find any excuse to extort you when you are most vulnerable.
I booked a car through EasyJet/CarTrawler paying in full for the rental, including insurance. I was told at Europecar counter that the car cannot be released because my Northern Ireland license could not be verified through some cluncky website that did not work. Nothing about this was mentioned when I bought the rental and paid up front. I ended up having to buy another expensive premium insurance package before the car was released. Extremely stressful experience that ruined my holiday. Avoid Europecar and CarTrawler if you want peace of mind and you don't want the stress of being ripped off by these scavengers.

Update 15/1/2024: As can be seen by the reply from Europcar they are happy to pass the blame to CarTrawler, who in turn pass the blame to Europcar. As a customer you would be best place to avoid both these companies that are happy to take your money and then point fingers at the other party. The customer is the loser at the end of the day!</div>

                <div class='text'>Be careful, once at the airport, they stole 895 pounds from us, claiming that it was a deposit that would be refunded when the vehicle was returned. At the end of the rental, they let us know that in the signed documents, there is a vehicle upgrade, premium guarantees and airport taxes which mean that the 895 pounds will not be returned. Pure theft! We strongly advise against it.

                <div class='text'>I rented a car from East Midlands.. I booked it through CarJet and paid for premium insurance.. Out of hours drop off and hire.. 3 days.. First of all there was no shuttle.. it was freezing temps.. The staff at the office refused to pick us up.. I had a 77yr old with me with a heart condition.. ( and luggage) It took us 1 hour 23 mins to find the cabin to collect the car.. I was told by the woman that my insurance from a third party was invalid and unless I paid their insurance they would block £1800 from my CC.. I opted to pay another £79 plus £100 deposit.. it was getting late and soon to be dark.. So signed only to find they not only took 5 days ins cover but another days car hire.. They are utter thieves. I did not read the small print but we were exhausted, desperate to leave before it got dark in -0 temperatures.. They have no morals, and I don’t know how the woman sleeps at night.. They are disgusting and would never use again..</div>

                <div class='text'>Found a vehicle online via a comparison site. Rang Europcar direct to arrange booking. Went through procedure of hire. I was told I needed to provide a check code which entailed me contacting dvla, enter my licence and national insurance numbers. I did this so that on collecting vehicle, counter staff could check my licence for endorsements.
I paid for hire with credit card and arranged to collect vehicle from my local depot.
I received a phone message a while later informing me that my local branch had no vehicle of any description available to hire at the time and my reservation had been cancelled.
Why take my booking? Their system obviously showed a vehicle was available otherwise my request should have been declined.
The booking system is long winded, irrelevant information required and they were unable to provide a service I requested.
I hired from another national company. The process was straightforward without the need to provide a check code.
I will not be using Europcar to hire a vehicle again.</div>

                <div class='text'>Europcar were asked, by Zurich Insurance, to provide a car similar to an Audi SQ7 while mine was being fixed. The first Europcar representative offered a Mercedes GLE (not really the same standard as the SQ7), then put us in touch with the local Europcar provider (Oxford Prestige) who then said the nicest/largest car they had available was a Volvo XC40. We agreed that they would arrive at 11am as I had a meeting at 10am. They arrived at 10:15am in the middle of the meeting and said I could just sign a form to take the car. The form stated 'No damage'. I inspected the car (taking photos and video) and found many chips and paintwork blemishes. I did not have time to look inside the car. Later this was found to be dirty, smelt of strong air-freshener and had exposed wires under the seats which my children were able to grab.

Europcar requested feedback through a website, which I provided and they asked if I would like to post my review on-line. On selecting this option, it redirected me to the French Trust Pilot site.

If your insurer recommends Europcar to provide any kind of courtesy vehicle, I suggest you ask them if they have an alternative provider.</div>

                <div class='text'>Worst hire experience ever.

Had prebooked and prepaid. We didn’t want the extra add on insurance because we’ve got that covered with a separate vastly cheaper annual cover provider. My credit card wouldn’t work, so had to pay around £100 extra to get the excess insurance otherwise Pathos airport said we couldn’t take the car as they needed a credit card on file.

Offered lots of other methods of payment, including debit cards and cash, or my wife’s credit card which has the same account number and card number… but we were told this was against company policy. So basically it felt like being forced to spend £100 on excess insurance when we were already covered elsewhere.

No attempt to help us or contact a manager for advice or find an alternative.</div>

I had a car booked by my insurance company for 2pm on Thursday 28th December, and it did not arrive, the Kings Cross branch were in charge of my reservation, and try an I might they did not pick up the phone, even there head office couldn’t get a response I was on hold for 3 hours at one point, listening to their jingle about how marvellous they are world wide, but they couldn’t even get a car to East London for a seriously disabled person with a Mororbility car, it really is a poor show! No one even tried to contact me to explain why there was a failure to deliver a car, and every customer service agent I spoke to gave ne the same brush off, “ yes we can see you were supposed to have a car yesterday, but its not possible to send you a care as its not from this branch” its pathetic and unprofessional, I have never had such diabolical customer service in all my years!
Shame! Shame! Shame!😡
After reading your reply, I can only assume you have no command of the English language!
Not once did I mention anything at any time about additional charges!
My complaint is that I was promised a car at 2pm last Friday, and I am still waiting!
I have contacted your head office, other branches and was assured that I would have someone from Kings Cross branch call me back in 15 mins, that was 5 hours ago, and again I have be attempting to call the branch, NO ONE IS PICKING UP THE PHONE!!!!!!!
Your company sucks big time, and I will endeavour to continue to complain relentlessly until they provide the service they claim they do( in an alternative dimension) it would just be common decency to take the time to speak to me and explain instead of the continual deception and lies they roll out from department to department!
SHAME! SHAME! SHAME!😡😡😡😡😡😡
This is day 4, will post again and again and again, might even get a taxi to the branch and find out whether or not your staff have the hands and fingers required to use a phone or PC!😡😡😡😡😡😡😩</div>

                <div class='text'>Beware, scam! Despite explicitly stating I do not wish any additional insurances or addons on pickup I was charged 110 GBP after the rental for several things like breakdown insurance, driver insurance etc. I already contacted customer support and they were unwilling to help in the matter. Very unfortunate that I will have to resort to a credit card chargeback. Clerks are trimmed to try and hide extra charges so you sign the contract without noticing them. It is bad enough they try this with people who do not know about this but it is REALLY bad when you explicitly decline and they still put it on the contract and then hide the section by conveniently placing another sheet of paper on top of that section of the contract. I only noticed until after I signed but then it was "too late" because I had already started the rental. I thought this was a reputable company... Stay away from Europcar!</div>

                <div class='text'>Absolutely terrible customer service. Booked a car in my partners name for £84 to arrive and them say it can’t be done so they would have to refund me and charge him. To which was absolutely fine by us, they charged him a £250 deposit fee (didn’t state this online but he agreed to it as it would be refunded upon return). It’s take FOUR weeks to refund it but has then charged him over £100 for the car when we paid £84 online?! Then after specifically telling them we didn’t want the extra insurance they charged it!!! Saying he signed to agree but we was literally waved a phone to sign with nothing on it. Which I can see happens a lot based on the other reviews here. Absolute JOKE of a company. They’re rude and unhelpful. Even went to the branch and they was just fobbing us off. Absolute robbing scamming company.</div>

                <div class='text'>This is just blanket dishonesty and I’m shocked by the total lack of respect for customers. My partner and I rent cars from Edinburgh airport about 5 times a year. Never had an issue with a UK car rental company, until now - Merry Christmas I guess.
- we pick up a car.
- lady at the reception tells us to fill fuel back to existing level (3/4 full) on return.
- on return 3 days later, we check the paperwork to double check, before going to petrol station.
- the paper work does not stipulate level of petrol at check in, so we take the word of the kind lady at reception, and fill it back to 3/4 on the nose. I have a photo of our rental agreement and the staff did not circle the fuel status…
-we arrive at drop of point to an unstaffed unit (all other companies had people there helping). No problem, we drop the keys in the letterbox and go get our flight.
- two days later we receive a charge of £20 for fuel, and £18 to fill up plus tax, so another £40+ quid. Apparently we need to fill it to the top? Despite it being only 3/4 full when we got it? Is this really the policy? If yes this is a total scam

As I say, we have a photo of rental agreement without any direction on fuel level, so hopefully this is resolved quickly.

Just FYI at Edinburgh airport there is an Avis and Budget car rental. We have used those before and never had any issues, they provide clear instruction, and honour their word and do not try and scam their customers. We will be using them next time and suggest anyone reading to as well.

Also I haven’t even got to the excess cover option on the insurance - at check in they tried to double our rental cost with this (£25 a day!!!). At this point I am starting to think it is just a racket…

                <div class='text'>Awful.

Car was over an hour and a half late in spite of reassurances when I was in the office.

When received car, it was upgraded as an apology and I was told they'd extend my booking at no extra charge, for what would be an extra 2.5 - 3 hours on my 24 hour booking.
I received my deposit back within the week - awesome! However, I then receive an invoice not only charging me for the extra time, but for refuelling it to a full tank (I received it with a half tank), plus an £18 refuelling service. I was also charged a £6.96 pound 'vehicle recovery surcharge'. I had opted for £17 extra insurance for the day - what was not mentioned was that there was a 20% tax on that as well. I was charged for 2 days insurance which was over £40!

I contacted customer service via email and they did eventually reduce my petrol charge (I was 8 litres shy of half way). however they were still charging me for 2 days of insurance.
I emailed, and eventually called from my home country (Australia) to contest paying for the extra days insurance, was shut down without much explanation beyond - its in the system that way, or we can't look at those records. I have no apparent recourse.

I want to pay what I owe for my error with refuelling and my days insurance, but the bill sits over £33 over as they wont change it. I have told them i want to pay what i agreed to in writing and over the phone.

Had such an awful experience, and I am now being threatened that I must pay within 7 days lest I be hit with more fees and charges, and be unable to rent from them again. Honestly, I don't think I will.

couldn't recommend them less.</div>

                <div class='text'>An expensive, awful experience. In my opinion, no matter how much you think you may need something moving, or even if you’re just desperate for a vehicle quickly, you should avoid Europcar.

We rented a van in October this year for a single day & didn't pay for the additional 'premium protection' offered. On the day, the staff at the front desk were helpful and the process of actually picking a vehicle up was quick & easy.

We were given a much larger van than we had paid for, as this was the only one available & unfortunately I caused some minor damage to the side of the van (knocked off a plastic protector panel with some reflectors).

After hearing nothing for 3 months, we finally received a bill from Europcar for £1,500 (the maximum I could be charged) for damage caused; the attached invoices included a figure over £2,000 to fix a small dent in the van!

Anyone with basic knowledge in this area can tell you this is an absurd & ridiculous amount for such a repair. My assumption is that such inflated figures exist purely to ensure people hit their maximum excess when causing damage of any sort.

We'll never use this company again. Though they've earned so much money just from a 1 day rental, I'm sure they won't mind losing another customer.</div>

                <div class='text'>I’m very disappointed to say that we were completely ripped off by this company. After one excellent experience, we decided to use them again as we travel every six weeks. We booked through car jet and took Car jet insurance which wasn’t a problem, as normal. The second time the staff member convinced us to take their insurance with 50% off and guaranteed we would be refunded by Car jet that this happened all the time. The next day doing as he instructed, I contacted Car jet they refused. Upon our return with the car we were told it wasn’t Europcars problem. To add insult to injury they’ve taken more money off the card for the insurance, then we agreed to. I work in hospitality in customer service and there’s one thing I never do and that is rip people off and misinform them. We have been in contact back-and-forth with the company who are just fobbing us off. 35 years I have worked in this industry and it’s the wrong way to treat people. Please don’t use them, because it’s not satisfactory at all . Booking under name Main.</div>

                <div class='text'>I had a terrible experience with this company. Was scammed by some sales reps in Mexico where they said a cost was in pesos and it was actually charged in dollars. Ended up being charged around 380 dollars for 2 days insurance. Horrendous and manipulative behaviour from the reps. Also customer service after this was awful. Unresponsive, unhelpful, apathetic and don't seem to care about customer experience. Terrible and stressful experience and would recommend against using at all costs.</div>

                <div class='text'>The Trafford Park Branch delivered a courtesy car (MG zs) 2023 registration that had a major drivers side rear tyre pressure leak. The first engine start up had the display "Rear driver's side air pressure is low". I didn't have a compressor inflator to inflate the tyre, so I bought one from Amazon for £29.98. By the time the compressor arrived, the tyre was flat to the floor!! So they knew there was a tyre problem, inflated it enough to deliver the car, then left the problem with me!! The hire contract was for 14 days.... after myself and my insurance company constantly trying to get them do something about it with absolute, uncaring and dismissive of any help whatsoever.... they sent a mobile KwikFit van to remove the flat tyre and fit a new tyre..... 12 days after delivering the car with faulty tyre that they must have known was faulty. The worst, most uncaring, unhelpful rental car dealership I've ever ever experienced or heard of.</div>

                <div class='text'>Europcar delivered a quality vehicle on time all as agreed, absolutely no problem. However, when Europcar collected the car they were 2 days late so I had no parking space. Europcar chose to deliver me a car from Kings Cross 25 miles away, then charged me £26.41 for the fuel to take it back? This was never made clear especially considering the car was being supplied through another insurance company so I was just advised I would get a like for like replacement whilst my car was off the road. Why not deliver to and from a closer Depot? Then Europcar took the money from my credit card without advising me and when I questioned this I was told someone would get back to me within three working days. I'm still waiting two weeks later.</div>

                <div class='text'>Agent at pick up ripped me off it seems. I made it clear to him I did not want or need any additional insurances, add-ons etc and I would bring back car fuel. Despite this he told me he added fuel option with the deposit but not to worry I get all money back. When I received final invoice, roadside assistance and a premium insurance had been added. Totally the opposite to what I had requested and been sold. Is this Europcar policy or did your agent go rogue? Either way I think it’s fraudulent deceit.

                <div class='text'>Booked Europcar through Easyjet for Belfast International. I'm originally from an NI border village so took the option to cross border. Was also upsold to an automatic. Asked for the cost breakdown and it was an outrageous £160 for the cross border charge. I had little choice at that stage but take it. I originally looked at the detail on easyjet website and buried in the terms and conditions it stated that i would be charged something for crossing the border but nothing about how much it would be. I got the invoices the next day and all the vat charges were incorrect. I now have been sent something that says I was charged for premium station and also got hit with extra charges on the upgrade. I have no idea whats going on. Its a complete racket and I would strongly advise anyone against using them for the their complete lack of transparency and terrible customer service. I live in Scotland and go back to Ireland at least 5 times a year. Typically the charge has been ~£30. I found the whole experience completely unacceptable for a modern professional service and really surprised that Easyjet allows such practices. Avoid if you can.

And a response as expected!</div>

                <div class='text'>Europcar Italy (Rome) still taking money from my credit card!!! This is now 4 months since my return from Italy. A fee of £21 for notifying me by email of an alleged speeding ticket. Emailed to ask for evidence, none received, yet £21 admin fee taken form my account. I have had to contact my bank to ask them to put a freeze on subsequent amounts and to investigate into all of the complaints I have. Similarly the car hire insurance I took out through Swinton have also been informed. So far I have had an extra charge of £100 for an upgraded car I did not ask for. A potential claim of over £500 for a scratch that was already on the car when I collected it, and now this admin fee of £21. I will try to avoid them but the problem is I hired a car as an add on to flights. We often use Jet2 but they then passed the car hire on to Europcar, so in future I will either not hire a car through the airline or specifically avoid Europcar in future. Why is it so hard to get an honest trustworthy service?</div>

                <div class='text'>I’m rarely one to complain but HONESTLY STAY CLEAR OF THIS LOT particularly in Edinburgh airport, literally go with anyone else. I have rented cars from numerous rental companies and never had one single issue. Rented from this lot through a 3rd party who I had taken full insurance with, so the car and full insurance for €370.
A day after I had dropped the car back, Europcar charged me €345 for insurance with themselves which was never mentioned once by the desk agent but was put into the contract as saying I had agreed to it. Why on earth would I agree to insuring a car that’s already insured for a price that’s nearly same as my original full rental price. When the desk agent gave me the documents to read she immediately started showing me pictures on her phone of some wedding photos asking me what I thought of the quality of them etc. basically distracting me so I wouldn’t notice the additional insurance she put in the contract. She intentionally robbed me, I have no doubt about it. I have since contacted the police to get CCTV footage of the rental centre so I have evidence of the desk agent distracting me after giving me the documents, I will then be taking legal action. I would have been a returning customer as I have a few trips planned to this same place in the coming months so they have immediately lost out on 3 or 4 times the money they’re after stealing from me. Do not go near this company.</div>

                <div class='text'>Update: 14.12.23
Give us a chance to solve your problem...
Just talk without effect, there is no interest in solving anything. I wonder what is the business of these companies, because renting cars to customers I don't think so. I will not repeat with them again.

In august I was traveling in England and had the bad idea to rent a car with europcar uk. I still don't know how but I didn't pay a highway toll, I didn't even know that I had to pay. The thing is that once in germany, the traffic department in uk claims me 5 pounds plus penalty for delay and on the other hand europcar uk wants to charge me 40 pounds for the administration, what administration if I have paid it all from germany.
The job of europcar uk should have been to pay immediately the 5 pounds claimed to your car registration number and at maximum then charge those 5 pounds to the customer, who had already paid a huge amount for the car rented with full insurance.
Europcar in Germany maybe, in England never again.

Update: 01.12.2023
the link with email is useless or unusable.
They are really interested in solving the problems of their customers, so here is the reference of my case:

Information Regarding your Vehicle Rental 155248867 [419241/4782] - Case #18242466 - Case #18279452

if they really solve them (I get my £40 back) I will update my review.

                <div class='text'>Bad! Never more! During our travel we had a flat tyre (we were awarned about that by the car display message "low pressure, check tyres"). We immediately called Europcar assistence that after 2 hours send us the road assistance. The guy didn't have the proper tyre and said us that the plug was not enough because the hole was on the side of the tyre and he also said that it would be illegal, so he called tyre assistence to replace the tyre. We paid 180 pounds and we asked that it be refund because we paied for the full cover for our rental. Europcar said us we should not have to pay and so far we didn't receive answer or refund, but what we had to do? Spend the night at 60 miles from our hotel when the next morning we had the flight back to home?? There was no option!
I cannot accept that because I arranged the full cover insurance with Europcar and I have paid the maximum possible amount to Europcar. I have rent car from them many times, but that was the last time for sure!

UPDATE
Europecar declined my request for the tyre repair to be reimbursed. They say I should have called the Europcar assistence and it was exactly what I did! The Europcar assistance arrive 2hours later and they didn't have the proper tyre, and he also said it should be illegal to drive so what was I supposed to do? Spend the night in the car and wait there till Monday (it was Saturday late afternoon) because its assistance didn't have the proper tyre since Monday as they said?? A flat tyre happens quite frequently and it is unapcettable that Europcar assistance doesn't have the proper tyre so, not to spend the whole night waiting in the car (and even more, from Saturday afternoon to Monday morning, the time necessary to Europcar to have a proper new tyre!), I had to call a private aasistance as suggest by Europcar assistence itself! I can absolutely say that Europcar is a scam, the most expensive rental company with a totally bad customer service and a very low level assistance on the road even for the most basic things. Avoid it!</div>

                <div class='text'>STAY AWAY!!

I cannot stress this strongly enough. Car dropped off in awful condition, keys literally thrown at me and person left in another car immediately. Damage not as stated (unfortunately for them I am not stupid and took plenty of photos).

6 weeks later a letter claiming for damages to the car, no info given and no evidence.

Out to rip off anyone they can, read the reviews this is not a one off.

Do yourselves a favor. Save your money and time and use a well reviewed car hire service. I had no choice in the matter it was provided by my insurance.

They should be embarrassed by themselves.</div>

                <div class='text'>Please don’t be tempted by what should be a great company. From start to finish it is appalling.
Latest we have extended our rental by a couple of days. Of course they took the money. Please can you confirm the extension in an email? Driving a car is a serious business, authority to use it, insurance, the law, police etc. No we don’t confirm (after taking payment) and anyway that office is closed!! I am sure that would go along way if there was a problem.
Please let us know how long does it take to get to the terminal after drop off? No idea is the response. Could we book a private transfer with a little more security than no idea. No!
Never again is all I can say.</div>

                <div class='text'>I don't recommend Europcar UK, especially in London Heathrow Airport (Terminal 5). The employee added extra insurances without asking. Of course, it is partially my fault since I did not check the document more carefully, but he asked me to sign the document without any explaination about the extra insurances.

In the beginning, he asked about exchanging cars since he could provide better one with reasonable price (by the way, extra 300-500 Euro/day) 2-3 times. I denided his suggestion since the budget was limit. And then, he finally brought the contract document and asked me to sign the document without explaining the extra insurances. I am really upset although I can not do anything at this moment.

In that reason, I don't recommend Europcar UK, especially in London Heathrow Airport (Terminal 5).</div>

                <div class='text'>I arranged for a car rental for my wife's use during her trip to Ireland with our children. Upon her arrival at the rental station, she encountered aggressive sales tactics. The staff insisted on her purchasing an excessively priced insurance policy, misleadingly claiming that the car could not be rented without this premium coverage. The cost of this additional insurance exceeded $1000. My wife, managing two very young children at the time, was unfairly pressured into this purchase. Regrettably, I was not accompanying them on this trip. I immediately contacted the company's customer service to address this issue but to no avail. We are now working with our bank to contest these charges. I strongly advise against using this company.</div>

                <div class='text'>Collected vehicle that was damaged and the depot hadn’t recorded it. I then went round the vehicle with the agent and filmed all damage to the vehicle. (I did this because having previously hired at the Manchester Trafford Park depot I have witnessed other other customers in similar disputes that have advised on always filming a video - so I do)

Agent then assured that this would all be added to the report and I had nothing to worry about. A day after returning the vehicle I received a damage notice and Europcar have raised an insurance claim.
I took the matter to customer service who asked me to send a screenshot shot of the video. They then replied a day later asking for further evidence so I send the video with both myself and their agent pre inspecting the vehicle.
As a previously regular customer I hadn’t had any issues and thought this would be quickly resolved. As such I booked another vehicle two days later… upon collecting it was the EXACT SAME VEHICLE. And still had unrecorded damage again I record a video and write down everything myself rather the than trust the agent to do so.
I return the vehicle and it’s the same agent from the first hire, I show him the video of himself, he assures me that he will take this to his manager
I have since sent two further emails asking for an update, during which time random figures have been withdrawn from my bank accounts - Despite sending the video I am still yet to receive a reply.</div>

                <div class='text'>Europcar are a fraudulent company through and through. They force you to take extra insurance, threatening that you cannot take vehicles until you do.

Everyone at the company says a different thing and then deny it and lose notes and complaints, their customer service is non existent and all they care about is taking as much money from customers as possible.

I wish I had read the reviews before renting a vehicle through them, there are so many illegal activities happening that they need to be closed down!

I warn you not to use them, you will regret it! Also, do not be fooled by their standardised template response to all these negative reviews asking you to submit a complaint, they won't do anything, they write that to show that they care about customers but they don't.

This is the worst company I have ever dealt with and I guarantee this company will not be around in a few years, eventually their illegal activities will be investigated.</div>

                <div class='text'>Instead of responding to reviews with automated messages. Find the decency to try and actually resolve the problem. The courtesy car with an engine light failure is still in my possession. I'm anxious to drive the vehicle due to breaking down in the middle of nowhere. The branch is no longer answering any of my calls, so i've now given up and resulted to taking London transport and taxi's to work meetings. I will report back to my insurance company today.</div>

                <div class='text'>Basingstoke branch . Twice Europcar didn't turn up with promised and agreed delivery of the hire car. Spent 2 days waiting for their arrival and they weren't even bothered to notify me that you weren't coming ( excuse later was that they didn't have drivers available to do it) . Wasted 2 days of my life waiting for Europcar's non arrival. Insurance company requested prestige car for me, they gave me 2019 (4 years old) heavily damaged all around and smelly Ford Focus and assured me that once the promised prestige car becomes available, they will exchange it as Ford Focus was meant to be temporary. The hire lasted over a month and Europcar didn't even offer to exchange their dingy Focus for prestige car despite promises. Awful company and I will avoid them at all costs in the future. Liars sorry to say.</div>

                <div class='text'>where do you start with such a shambolic company. meant to deliver a courtesy car (through insurance) on the 15th November. Car didn't show up, so called them and after several frustrating hours of phone calls they denied the delivery date stating the car was booked i for the 15th december. to be fair i was fairly rude to the initial person who booked the car and i think she changed the date just to annoy me. I'd say they're the worst company I have ever dealt with, but that prize is already taken by aviva!!</div>

                <div class='text'>I am a lady driver and On 5th November at 4.30pm another lady driver pulled out of a side street and collided with the side of my car…reported to my insurance company on Monday 6th and my car was picked up for repair the same day…Europe car hire delivered hire car in due course… after speaking to the Coventry Branch and filling in online information…. I found I could not sign the online signature … I just could not work out how to do it… I rang Europcar and explained to them.. they could not advise me how to complete this…but I could not drive the car until I signed…long story short after talking to Beam AA insurance company and again speaking to yet another Europecar person they sent a driver out to my house so I could physically sign a form… witnessed by my son and their employee Scott…
Unfortunately the company are still saying I have not signed and yesterday voided the hire via email … after spending hours on the phone and talking to numerous people ( who did not know each other… when asked do you know Ash? No I don’t … do you know Jama… no…)
So … I ring again yesterday and ask to speak to supervisor…. Don’t work on Sunday…. Help!!! I now can’t drive the car and I know when I ring tomorrow they are going to tell me the same thing 😕.
Oh and by the way my insurance company rang them and they were told I had not signed and now the insurance people are believing Europcar…. I have spent literally hours on this project I do hope someone can help me…I am losing the will…😭</div>

                <div class='text'>Misleading and deceptive hire experience - was lied to on the level of insurance cover and ability to drop off at different location - now being chased to pay for existing damage. Will never hire again from Europcar.

Also don't be mislead by Europcar's 'boiler plate' responses to comments to resolve issues. Their customer service team don't resolve the issues and put the blame back on their customers.

My advice is find another hire car company that actually understands customer service and care.</div>

                <div class='text'>This review is a warning not to fall for scare tactics when it comes to their premium cover. If you still feel you need additional cover than what they offer as standard shop about. There are dozens of places that offer more comprehensive cover and for a fraction of the cost. £220 for a week is scandalous and its pure profit for them. You can get better elsewhere for about £40 for the week. No wonder they are so keen to offer it. The finacial incetives for the sales person and the fact that they are probably targeted means they have to be pushy with it. My partner however fell for this. She needed a hire car as ours was having some work done and she needed to get home to say her goodbyes to her dying Grandmother. She booked the car online and went to pick it up. She'd read through the cover options and selected the one she required which was the standard one. That didn't stop the person behind the counter laying on the spiel about how much it will cost her if anything were to happen. They were aware of her predicament before hand and also knew she had to make haste but that doesn't stop them. Laying it on thick for someone who already had enough to worry about. In hidsight she knew she should have cancelled when she got down the road and realised that she'd been fleeced but as I said, she had other things on her mind. It's pushy sales tactics that pray and people insecurities to flog an overpriced product. Thankfully there are other more affordable options available elsewhere otherwise I'd suggest this con by the hirecare companies should be looked in to. I did make a complaint about how it was sold to an already vulnerable person but it fell on deaf ears. They're not that interested. She'd signed a contract and that was that. Very little contrition on there part knowing full well how they operate and how much they charge, knowing full well their options are a million miles from being competitive.

Jusy say no and shop about if you feel you need it.

I await the stock response saying how sorry they are and that they will look in to it. Just empty words.

                <div class='text'>I booked a car through rentalcars.com and have added full insurance in. When picking up the car I was told by the agent to hand over my debit card and thought that was for a deposit as usual. Then a couple of days later I realised I was charged for a way more expensive insurance I didn't ask for - and my original insurance was cancelled. I feel like I was ripped off and totally misled by the insurance switch. I obviously signed the contract but tbh the document wasn't that straightforward so ended up signing without fully acknowledge it. I then reached out to customer support and the macro response was "As the rental agreement and additional product form have been signed in acceptance of the product, the request for the charge to be refunded has been respectfully declined."

I am certainly no longer a customer and strongly advise choosing a more transparent provider.</div>

                <div class='text'>Really disappointed 😞. 21st century how you have to bring all your drivers to the branch for their licence to be checked. 2. A 7day rental on 6th day asking to add one driver I have to pay insurance for this driver, of £14x7days though just a day left to return.
5day rental with limited mileage of 250miles per day I extended by 2 more days just realising my deposit is not refunded despite the branch telling me that your £250 deposit will refunded in 3-7working days. Now just told they have recalculated and realised that any rental of 7 days reduces mileage to 90miles per day so my deposit is lost through mileage 😒😒😒 which was a total of 1264miles for 7days which both the branch on day of vehicle return and myself thought was under 250miles allowance day.😒😏😒.

                <div class='text'>At around 17.45 on 01/11/2023 I had a car delivered from Europcar as a courtesy car for Motability whilst my own car is off the road & in the garage, I didn't use the car until the following morning. But when I started the engine a tyre pressure warning light came on, I called Europcar to report this along with a couple of other things that weren't on their damage list given to me at handover. But all they said was that I had to report it via their damage email. After this call I went out in the vehicle, only to find it drove really heavy & that I had to push the accelerator almost fully down to get any sort of power when crossing a roundabout.
My daughter-in-law drove it on 04/11/2023 & said that it was horrible to drive (she has driven an identical car to this, as her mum had one & that one did not drive like this one) & even you paid her she wouldn't get behind the wheel of that car again. I have been sent from one person to another, been told different things by different people, been spoken abruptly to, (was even told that because my name is spelt wrong on the rental agreement that my insurance wouldn't be valid, it is) so much so that I ended up contacting Motability, bursting into tears on the phone & getting them to try to sort things.
Due to this software/electrical issues with my own car I became afraid to drive it incase it went wrong whilst I was using it, hence my getting a courtesy vehicle from Europcar, but can honestly say that I felt safer driving my own car than this hire car. I have been placed on a list for a replacement vehicle, but not given any eta on this happening, even though I told them that I need a safe working car due to a couple of personal things.
This company despite having a contract with Motability to supply courtesy vehicles to those on the Motability scheme when their own vehicle breaks down & is in the garage, meaning they should keep so many aside for this purpose, but do NOT. Yet, they don't give motability customers the same customer service that they give cash paying customers (those that hire a vehicle through the normal channels, via walk in, website or phone) They treat Motability customers like second class citizens, this car is a prime example of that as it should never have been sent out with any warning lights lit up on the dashboard yet it was sent out to me, something that would not have happened had I been a paying customer. If I were a paying customer I would avoid this hire company like the plague & will NEVER recommend it to anyone.

Update:

On 06/11/2023, I wrote the above review, which Europcar replied to (see below) asking me to contact them on the website in said reply. However, is you go to this sight & click on the email icon, it gives you 3 options, the 2nd applies to me as it is an issue during rental, then it gives you another list of options, none of which applies to me, meaning I can't use this option to contact them as they request in order for them to resolve my issues. Again, if I didn't have a Motability car currently in the garage you couldn't pay me to use Europcar. If I could give them 0 stars then believe me I would 100% do that, I will also tell anyone thinking of using them to run in the opposite direction & find a different hire company to use. These in my honest opinion are one of the worst vehicle hire companies around</div>

                <div class='text'>False Claim, Avoid this Company by all means..

ADVICE before you drive thier hired cars please make sure you take all the photos of everything inside and out, this includes fuel guage and mileage.

I recieved a car from this company through COGENT hire as had someone hit my car from the back and needed fixing. My insurance arranged everything. The car was delivered to my house and we went through all the procedures. But before using the car, I had took all the precautions, I took all the photos of scratches, alloy, fuel gauge and mileage just to cover my back.

I recieved this car on the 5th of September 2023 and my car was fixed and returned in the morning on the 8th of September. Anyway I informed them straight away to come and collect their car but never did until the 15th of September, which wasnt an issue to me as the Car was parked securely at home.

On the 15th someone came to collect the car, he just came and took the car without doing all the procedure and I asked him why he wasnt checking and he said he was just asked to collect the car. After a day I recieved a letter saying I had not filled back the fuel which I did and had receipts and photos of the fuel gauge of the before and after. After all the explanation they said it was in error and didnt need to pay anything.

To my surprise, on the 26th of October 2023 after over a month they send me a letter saying I had damaged the alloy wheels. What a joke! It took them over a month to check the car but they had checked the fuel guage the following day after collection and wanted to RIP me off and failed and now they sending me false damages after over a month of having the car. The car shouldn't have been driven from my house without doing proper procedures the same procedure you did when you dropped it. Whoever collected the car could have done those damages you're are claiming was me. Why collecting a car without making sure all procedures are followed.

I'm glad I covered my back by taking before and after photos of everything and im happy to be going to Court if I have to as I have all the evidence I need. I would not be paying a penny to this SHAM of a company. They have definitely destroyed thier own reputation by ripping off people left and right.

I wonder how they sleep at night...ain't we all struggling!</div>

                <div class='text'>Avoid at all cost. We were told we would be charged the total amount of £167 for the van rental with no hidden cost. And yes we have signed the documents without reading it properly so yes you can argue it was our fault but tbh we have trusted the person was explaining everything to us. Days after the rental £249 came out our account for the hire and premium cover which we did no agreed to . Numerous of phone calls and emails later they don’t want to hear it but are happy to mislead and missale. Absolutely shocking customer service and managers only available if you really push to speak them</div>

                <div class='text'>I am not used to publishing negative comments, but, after having gone through the official channels and having received a negative response to the complaint, I am going to explain my experience relating to a car rental in London Gatwick with Europcar.
After booking and paying for the rental and premium insurance in Arguscarhire online, I was told to go to the Europcar desk.
There, after pointing out to the employee that we had already signed up for the premium policy online, I was asked to sign the forms to proceed with the rental. I thought the various amounts summarized the coverage already purchased, but at no time the employee mentioned additional costs.
Consider that it was almost midnight, people in line and the difficulty of the language.
Result: compared to the online rental + insurance cost of around €200 with Arguscarhire, I was charged an additional €360 for additional insurance coverage that was not requested!
The response was that I had signed, but judge for yourself whether this is correct and serious behavior towards a customer.
I read other comments and I'm not the first.
Dear Europcar, is this your way of doing business?</div>

                <div class='text'>It took them 11 days after the collection date to finally collect the car. The car was delivered with numerous dents and scratches plus the tyres were close to the legal limit. I also had to put some oil in the engine as the oil light came on. The customer service department also lie to you.This is the second time my insurance company has provided me with a curtesy car from them and both times I have had problems.</div>

                <div class='text'>Do not use Europcar UK

I had made an online booking from home allowing me the time to consider which car, insurance etc. suited me best. I choose a MG at a cost of GBP 318.

Arriving at the counter at Manchester the show began. Everything in my online booking was questioned, which is exactly what I want to avoid making an online booking, i.e. risking saying yes to something that is not fully transparent. What is the point then of making a online booking?

I was asked whether I wanted a manual or automatic. I was not informed about any price difference and in my naivity thought it was because they had excess automatics. At no point in time was I informed that it came with an additional cost.

I was asked about navigation. I said no thanks and I do not know whether I have paid for it. I cannot see it from the very little informative invoice.

I was asked about insurance. I said 3 or 4 times that I wanted the insurance packaged I had ticked of in the online booking. It turned out I got a much more expensive solution. Again I was not informed about the difference in cost.

I was offered a VW passat instead of the MG booked online. Luckily I said no, despite the fact that I was asked if I was sure 4-5 times. I bet that also came with an additional cost that I was not informed about.

I was not taken through the rental agreement, but was only shown were to sign, which I did in my naivity. I just received the invoice, GBP 776, more than twice the preferred solution in my online booking.

No wonder that we were only two persons at the Europcar counter whilst the Avis counter had 10-15 people queuing. I guess it is back to Avis.

Taking a look at the review of the various Europcar entities here on trustpilot, Europcar UK stands out as the worst scoring Europcar entity. My experience is completely in line and follow the same pattern as all the other unsatisfied customers reviews in here. Complete lack of customer care.

I have filed a complaint to Europcar UK, but got a fairly standard answer. Of course they rejected to pay back anything.

Update 6 November: No response using the link. after two complaints via mail both with negative response, I have been directed towards BVRLA!!</div>

                <div class='text'>This company miss sell additional products, even when you tell them you only want the basic package and to pay the quoted price. I was over charged 322 pounds, and customer services upheld the payment after I explained that I had specifically stated I only wanted the basic deal.
Record your conversation at the time you collect your car and paperwork.
They need to look into their staff who miss sell extra insurance and premium deals.
I have been totally ripped off, I would never recommend this company.</div>

Booked a car from Sheffield via Trip.com.
Turn up and am told they don’t currently have any cars, and that they’re closed at the time i wanted to return it the following day.
Woeful out dated systems, front desk staff tapping things into her computer, asking for contact details in triplicate, meanwhile trying to upsell on insurance. None of the out dated systems stuff are her fault but she wasn’t especially polite about the lack of a car to take at the booked time.
I will not be using Europcar again, either in the uk or anywhere else.</div>
